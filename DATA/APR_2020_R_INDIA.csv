We are building Future of credit - Financial inclusion to everyone

We are searching for kickass name & which should not related to credit, it should be trendy, easy to  spell for every one country agnostic, we are creating a new platform where it takes milli seconds to  apply loan by  borrower with or without financial history Lenders able to underwrite & disburse the loan in seconds, with out human intervention. We are also changing the entire credit process  & using smart phone alternative credit data. We are using AI, ML, quantum computing in big time you‚Äôre interested in changing the future of credit.

3 billion humans cannot access basic credit services and fewer than 9% of citizens in developing economies have ever taken a loan from a financial institution.

In many economies, generations of people are governed by a dark underworld of illegal lending‚Ää a pseudo-economy ran by gangsters and fraudsters. For these 3 billion people, the idea of accessing enough credit to buy a home or start a business is a pipe dream. 

In countries rich and poor, access to credit is a fundamental cornerstone of social mobility. No matter your age, gender, language or nation, credit is the key driving force to boosting prosperity. From a newlywed couple looking to settle down and buy their first home, to an aspiring entrepreneur looking to start a small business, virtually every human on the planet depends on credit. It is the gateway to financial inclusion and ultimately financial freedom.

(Serious)I am building an app that would allow people to donate food and riders to collect it and deliver it to the lower section of the society and the ones that are most needy like the migrant workers. The application would be ready in a couple of days and would be available on Google Playstore.

The problem here is that we need to reach to the class that has no technology to ask for help. I need suggestions for it.

Also, we need volunteers with vehicles who have e-passes to go out during this period for this to function at a big level.

I've heard cats do better alone, so I'm open to getting a cat, but I'm concerned how much the per month cost will be. As I'm thinking of adopting, there won't be major  initial cost.

If cats are too expensive, I'm thinking of going with a guinea pig or a hamster but idk how fun having one of those will be.

77,"Did Government and media failed to teach people how the virus spreads and how to avoid it?I think lockdown is not a solution to minimise the virus spread. The virus is spread from the water droplets that come out of an infected person when they speak or cough or sneeze. So maintaining enough distance (at least 2m) from people (anyone) is important. Virus stays in air for sometime depending upon the humidity, so wearing mask is important. Virus can show its first symptoms after 5-12 days so don‚Äôt neglect social distancing ( this term hardly anyone knows in better way but it is just keeping distance from people of at least about 2m or more) at any cost. Virus can stay on different surface so maintaining personal and surrounding hygiene is important. But no govt official or media is taking an effort to educate people about all this information. Rather forcing everyone to stay at home. I understand that this will ultimately keep people away from other but what if the lockdown ends? People will still crash into others personal space and the whole thing will start all over again. 

So did we failed to educate people?",1586986260.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,13,22

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you‚Äôre ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that‚Äôs ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you‚Äôve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It‚Äôs ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don‚Äôt have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it‚Äôs absolutely essential. Don‚Äôt take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people ‚Äî in your home, or in a car, because you‚Äôre on your way to see a doctor (and only after you‚Äôve called first) ‚Äî wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven‚Äôt just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don‚Äôt share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you‚Äôre touching anything that might carry the patient‚Äôs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

87,"Shame On you (Godi)Media and A fun ""discussion challenge"" During Lockdown.TLDR:-> A Mother called his son ""Anti National"" while they are having a religious discussion and son put up some facts about Muslim. 

Now the Challenge:--> Discuss any religious topic with your family member. Ask a lot of why? and Share your outcomes. 

\----------------------------------

Full Story

\----------------------------------

A thought occurred in my mind.

We know Rama as a ""Maryada Purushottam"" and ""Ideal Person"". So What did he do So that we can call him a ideal Person.I searched my mind and only able to figure out some like left kingdom, left his wife as a king etc.

I couldn't find any other thing.

So I went and have a discussion with my Mother. I told her ""what did Rama do? And Why should I follow him? There are a lot of people like Gandhiji, Bhagat Singh etc and these people did this kind of work.That's why someone should follow these people. So What about Rama?""

My mother told me ""Rama Left the kingdom, left his wife as a king and he is a god who took birth as a human for us. So we should workshop him. And don't ask these type of question about religion and to religious people(i.e priest)?"".

 I quietly asked ""Why should not I asked question about religion and to priests?"" Mother told me ""Because they are always right we should do as they told us to.""

I told her ""if I got infected from Corona and A priest say that God chose me for his work. Now spread that virus and do your duty"" So that will be right?

She thought for a second then said ""No, you should ask question.""

So I told her ""Maa, There are a lot of people who think that whatever their religious leader saying is right. They neither ask question nor actually think about that. They just do whatever their religious man is saying. And These people belongs to every religious Hindu, Muslim, Sikh etc.. And These Tablighi Jamaat are also such people""

As Soon as I put up the Muslim reference(and other fact about them) in our discussion She said ""*So Now you have became anti-national also"".*

I was like WTF. **I live in a remote village. On daily basis my mother watch a little news on these shit channels. You can imagine the kind of damage Godi media have done that ""A Mother is calling his son Anti-National"".**

To Godi Media: I will do what ever in my control to stop you. and If any person from Godi Media is reading this ""Shame On you"".

Ok Done.

**Now come the Challenge Part:**

263,"Life and Economy too, Our Future (REPOST)  EDIT: Reposted because original had Jaan Bhi, Jahan Bhi written in title (Seems very discriminatory to not allow our language even in quotes but whatever hopefully this one isn't)

Wanted to discuss the situation regarding the extension today, it was a basic need for a country like ours for sure, just imagine if community spread starts in India it will dwarf the problems the whole world is looking at now. We see teasers of this even today in Surat etc., but they are just sparks and it will be a storm if it spreads.

Having said that one thing I do feel we are neglecting is the economical part, which might lead to bigger problems than the flu itself. Even with the lockdown lifted labor that is gone won‚Äôt be instantly back, in fact I expect labor still in place will head for their homes, this will be just the 1st step. We are unable to immediately revive even our essential manufacturing facilities and this delay will lead to shortages increasing panic across the country. This leads to a self-feeding issue i.e. the problems compounding due to not stopping a small problem leading to bigger and bigger ones. I am in Punjab, from my window I can see the fields ripe for harvest, it was to be ramping up last week with full flow tomorrow, it is looking very unlikely right now because of the lack of labor. After the lifting of lockdown if it takes weeks upon weeks to get back to production, the shortages will become more and more dire and in the following months we will see the fire that the tiny sparks in Surat, Mumbai etc. are trying to show bringing us face to face with fate in an abyss.

The main reason for writing this isn‚Äôt to point out our bad future or blame someone it is to suggest some basic resources we haven‚Äôt utilized till now, some ideas. Starting from the labor or our poorer brethren heading back, it is because they feel outsiders in the place they are, unable to receive help or the unknown scaring them for the future, we solve this we start our work on solving our non-flu problems. Right now, at a time of limited resources we are using the bare minimums to seek out the needy (Police delivering food), we need to reverse this the needy need to come to the source (Pyasa Kuey pe aye, Kua pyase ke pass nai), of course that is basically breaking the lockdown so what we need is something very accessible that wont lead to a breaking of curfew yet accessible enough for the needy to access. The two things I can think of are police stations and post offices, every neighborhood in our country has one of these nearby. We should implement distribution of resources to the needy by them approaching the nearest one and collecting the resource, this can be further closed down to the needy of station ‚Äú32‚Äù area, ‚Äúrow 1‚Äù can send 1 person from 8 to 830 and ‚Äúrow 2‚Äù from 9 to 930 so on. If some needy are left they use the phone numbers and the resources are delivered by night. This can also work for the harvest we need the labor willing to work to assemble at the local station maintaining social distance at a specific hour and the ones who need labor can sign them up or even not have a face to face have the labor register and the hirer registering at different times and the nearest ones matching are informed. This can be implemented in a manner which minimizes the number of people outside at the same time, put money into hands needing them, if somebody is not hired then the info is already there and we utilize MNREGA and make sure everyone who needs work has income.

We need to utilize the vast call center resources that our country has, the call centers should be hired for a limited time by the government to answer calls and make calls so every citizen is in touch and knowledgeable about their duties and fulfillment of their needs, this has 3 benefits, calling can be done from home, phones have a very deep reach into the interior needy areas, income start for the callers. This should be done against a basic citizen database so info can added next to every name, if they are good it says good, if the have a need the need is mentioned, then by level of severity the issues are handled by the required organization.

Running out of room so lastly, the biggest resource we are not utilizing is our citizens at home, they can be put to use in many ways, Ill give one example. Our medical sector is facing a huge need of PPE equipment, if you look at what this equipment it is something that can be made at home with resources we already have (Standards might not be same but something is more than nothing.) The lack of visors for example, how many of us have helmets at home simply remove the glass at front attach elastic and we have one visor ready, if the government puts out a request we as a community can respond to what we can and what we make can be collected from houses and reach where needed. We have so many professions essential sitting at home, today Punjab got 1000 tests, that is a bit less than the testing required, we need every chemist in the country to have the information needed to make the test if they can prepare it they do and government can collect. 

These ideas might be the worst you have heard but what I am trying to get to is in a stereotype Indians are portrayed as IT nerds, call center land or brainy we need to be utilizing these for basic ideas. Only lockdown wont save us. I would ask you try reach to whoever you can to try and spread the ideas. I will try and get my idea to someone in authority, if you want please write your solutions and post on Facebook twitter or whatever you have, I am tired of reading our issues everyday in newspapers hopefully in a few days newspapers will be carrying information that can be utilized to solve a problem we are facing.

We can do that or do nothing, ‚ÄúMay the Planet heal and life thrive‚Äù

267,"India And The PandemicHealth like never before has become the primary Global agenda today. While the virus is spreading at speed of jet, the world is still clueless on how to control it, especially the west. As of now over 1.9 million Covid 19 cases have been reported and more than half of them have been recorded across Europe and US only. With the Chinese having controlled the virus spread and swinging back to motion, all eyes are now on India's combat in the South Asian region. India being the second most populous country with highest population density is always vulnerable to pandemics of large scale such as Covid 19. Considering the population India has, it is interesting to see that it has managed to keep the numbers to a low.

PREEMPTIVE MEASURES

India was swift enough to place preventive measures early sighting the seriousness of situation and was more apt prepared than any other major country. The US, China, Italy, Spain and UK recorded community transmission within 20 days after first detected case , while its been over 60 days of our first case and we are still in Stage 2 and in very well control of the situation.

India was fast enough to take rapid actions to limit abroad travels by suspending visas, thermal screening and quarantining of incoming travellers. Also India started closing its border, issued advisories to travellers, evacuated its citizens from Iran, China,Italy and Japan. And all of these was done much before WHO declared Covid 19 as a Pandemic. Taking a leaf out of China's aggressive strategy, India has imposed a nationwide 40 day Lockdown .Clear communication has been setup between states and centre government for imposing and controlling the Lockdown. A very strong surveillance system is spread across all the districts with Rapid Response Teams active in all of them. Hotspots are being identified to minimise spread.

While every needed step is taken to prevent the Stage 3 transmission but knowing that our expenditure on health is very low ,the facilities and infrastructure of our public health system are extremely strained , one cannot ignore the potential danger that community transfer possesses.

PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM

A preparedness plan has to address all levels of cure in terms of infrastructure , equipment, testing facilities and human resource in both public and private sector. We have the largest population that is least equipped to cope with crisis like Covid 19. Health expenditure across India today are fastest growing component of rural family debt. India spends only 1.3% of its GDP on Public Healthcare Systems which is by far lower than global average of 5.4%. We have to realise that there is an immediate need to increase it in coming years.

""Hope for the best and Prepare for the worst"". It is good to see that preparation for combating community transfer have already started. Government has scaled up its health infrastructure to handle evolving situation. Ventilators, PPEs and other necessary medical devices have been ordered in mass and to be supplied at earliest. Much like Spain plans are put forward to acquire Private Hospitals and Laboratories under public control for limited period of time. Also the government has ensured that the treatment for Covid 19 will be covered under Ayushman Bharat scheme, but in case the severity of the pandemic rises then the government would also have to look at large,differentiated and uncovered middle class too.

RISE OF LEADER NATION

Most of the big guns have been hit hard and are now burdened heavily with their own situations. With the WHO been found wanting many times, the world is lacking a United Leadership at the moment. United efforts are need of the hour and our Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading the charge for coordinated efforts to minimise threat of this deadly virus.

India holded first high level SAARC meeting since 2014. India's decision to hold the conference despite open reservations against talking to Pakistan reflects Befitting attitude of a Leader nation that has risen above billateral issues to engage all nation to think of larger regional good. Even when a global crisis looms large, India has depicted that the SAARC spirit should be sustained and the organisational platform can be used to foster regional cooperation.

Inida's Pharmaceutical industry meets over 50% of Global demand and with Hydroxychloroquine showing early trends of success , this makes India a key player in the coming time. PM Modi has stressed for need for a Humanitarian and not just economic based approach to globalisation. India's efforts are being recognised and applauded globally

ROAD AHEAD

A friend of mine had quoted ""We have focussed long on being the one with button that kills millions than having the one that saves lives"". We never have done enough to prepare for future infectious outbreaks. Its high time to realise that we should make united efforts in providing Primary Healthcare and Education to everyone.

There has to be more transparency and an open environment for sharing and discussion. Once things get to normal, we need to come to accountability of this suffering, had the new strain been reported earlier by China the world would have got more time to tackle it.

While the trials of candidate vaccine are already underway,which is amazing and encouraging but it will still take time for vaccine and treatments to be studied and scaled up. So in meantime we all need to do our part and STAY HOME.",1586936432.0,,Post link Directly,dark,8,3

277,"Seeking advice about foreign tourists coming to India in SeptemberHello everyone. 

I know everyone is unsure of the future at this point but I thought that I could get some advice and opinions on this topic. I have a flight booked with United Airlines to leave the USA on August 31st, arriving in Delhi, and was planning to backpack through Ladakh, Himachal, and Uttarkhand. United Airline's policy now is saying that you must choose to change your flight by April 30th, the latest, in order to have change fees waived, and they will issue a travel voucher. Change fees are about $350. If I go ahead and cancel the flight to receive a the travel voucher (no refunds) and things seem safe to travel again in September, re-booking the same flight will cost $300 extra, as the cost of the flight has increased. 

My other option is to rebook for January and head to South India instead, although it would be disappointing since I had my Himalayas trip planned far in advance and I am very excited. Being in isolation with just me and my dog for the past month, thinking about my upcoming trip to India has kept me going. September and January are the only months in the year that I can travel because of work.

There are a lot of cultural and religious traditions in my family that are borrowed both from our ancestral Lucknow and from adopted Karachi. I remember celebrating the night with a mix of Hindu, Muslim and Christian friends.

I posted this last week on my Facebook, and wanted to share here with our friends from the other side. Perhaps we can see some commonality. I hope this gets posted. (reposting again

\--

The night of #15Shabaan has never been an ordinary night for a Muslim teenager. For some of us in Karachi, it is almost like Eid - new clothes, cakes and presents. For others, it is about food and sweetmeats. For almost everyone, it is about prayers and astaghfaar. For me, however, it was about firecrackers and patakhay for many many years.

Growing up in Karachi, Shab e Barat was one of those few traditions that continued to connect us with the longing of AJTFS throughout the year despite it just being a one-day event. It is celebrated every year on the night of 15th of Shabaan (neema Shabaan = Middle of Shabaan) with much fanfare, prayer, and nazars. For me, what started with firecrackers and food during my teenage years turned into a deeply spiritual practice over the years. It is customary among many Muslims to pen a letter of love and dedication to Imam-e-Zamana (a.s.) during the night of the 15th. This letter is called ""Areeza"" meaning ""Request"".

As kids, we loved writing and submitting an Areeza. I can't be sure about how Areezas are submitted elsewhere. In my family, in Karachi, we'd get a few blank Areezas from the mosque and then complete them using a qalam - a type of pen made from a cut, dried reed, used for Islamic calligraphy. The qalam would be dipped in an ink made from saffron and itr (non alcoholic scent), and then we'd write our requests, dreams, aspirations, and profess our love for the Imam e Waqt. It would be an intensely personal moment and an opportunity to share our inner most desires and fears. Once completed, these could be delivered to any tributary - a river, lake or the sea. I always felt the longing and the belief took precedence over the process and the tools, so I‚Äôve tried to write Areeza‚Äôs throughout the year instead of just Shabaan.

10-15 years ago growing up in Nazimabad, we had only a few options. We could either go to our local mosque Noor Ul Emaan where they'd have paper Areezas for us to submit. And then the mosque volunteers would deliver these completed Areezas to Naity Jaity (Native's Jetty). The second option was to write an Areeza at home and then go to Naity Jaity ourselves. Now this second option was much fascinating for the youth as it likely involved a road trip!

I have to admit, during my teenage years, my fascination for the day and what followed was more superfluous than spiritual. I remember the day starting with fasting and helping my mother with groceries. There would be an elaborate nazar later in the day so we all looked forward to the kabab, halva and the puriz. We'd make portions of the nazar and take to the graveyard. After offering Fateha for the grandparents and other relatives, we'd distribute the nazar amongst the custodians. Back at home, we would break our fasts, and perform amaal for the day. The lucky ones got to sneak out and celebrate with firecrackers and patakhay.

In our particular home, we had a mix of Lucknow and Karachi traditions. After the evening Nazar, we‚Äôd start our amaal and stay up for the whole night. After midnight, we complete the amaal and start writing our Areezas. My mother would make dough balls for us to bury our Areezas in. I remember she telling me the reason why we use dough balls was because the fish from the Naity Jaity would carry the Areezas off to AJTFS. The place used to be packed - people from all walks of life, vendors and small groups from all over. Everyone converging on this auspicious night to share their deepest desires, aspirations and fears with the Imam e Waqt (a.s). It would be a surreal moment to reckon with. In my family, we were always to spend the night in Ibadaat rather than being swept in the culture of firecrackers that seemed to have taken root. I remember stopping on our way back at Saabri Nihari Saddar and having Nihari early morning just as crimson would start to engulf the horizon.

There is much debate today about the necessity of faith and religion. No matter which lens you view Shab e Baraat through, it is a testament that one‚Äôs belief is at the core of our individual survival. All of us, many of us, while we may speak different languages, follow different religions, we are almost always, expressing the same faith in a power beyond us.

And whether we believe in this or not, we acknowledge deep down, that there are things beyond your control.

And that is what binds us all together. #EidMubarak",1586958077.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,0,11

321,"A Question to all Legit Suppliers and Manufacturers from IndiaHi all, I've been looking for direct suppliers and manufacturers for N95 masks from India particularly 3M masks. I heard that they were cheap if I source from this country and I've seen some very promising suppliers and manufacturers from India's B2B marketplaces with good prices. To cut the story short, I've got over 50 suppliers blowing my phone and email but my problem is 90% of them do not offer safe payment methods such as PayPal Goods and Services or Escrow (kind of like Alibaba's Trade Assurance).

All of them also seem to have the same method, send photos of the masks (some are really just recycled photos taken from elsewhere) and they do not even offer sample/trial orders (orders with very less quantity to check the item and verify authenticity). Some do, but minimum order is like 500-1000pcs which is definitely not a trial order. Somehow, I got a feeling that all these guys are part of one big elaborate scam. Asking to wire money through T/T, WU, MG etc. and PayPal Family & Friends. Some have websites but they are really very sketchy and badly designed.

We cannot buy from China either as their masks cost more than $5 dollars a piece even with a MOQ of 1000pcs. But we all know that 3M masks do not even reach a retail price of $2. Another reason why we can't buy from China is because the moment you sell more than the SRP, our government will arrest you and your goods get confiscated and donated. A close friend of mine owns a bunch of retail stores hence, why we are looking for extremely cheap 3M masks. Plus, we have contacts with a lot of private buyers and companies who want to buy masks at very high quantities.

So to sum it all up, there are no n95 masks here because no one wants to sell because the government won't allow us to sell it over the SRP (anti price-gouging), and we can't just rely on donations either.

So a question to all you legit suppliers and manufacturers out there, am I just asking to get screwed? What are your suggestions? How do you handle transactions from foreign buyers?",1586933997.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,13

I took in two stray kittens, they mostly stay indoors but sometimes go outside. A few months ago I was feeding them boiled chicken and one of their teeth touched my finger, I wasn't sure if I bled but I went to the hospital, told them what happened. They gave me 4 shots on days 0,3,7 and 28 and asked me to get a booster a year later. Today while I was about to go out, one of them bit me on the leg through pants. I was wearing thick jeans at the time but I did feel her teeth, I went outside but I had a bit of realization 10 minutes in and decided to check my leg. I couldn't find a wound, I dont believe she penetrated through the clothes and it didnt seem like that strong of a bite either. But I still washed it with soap and water about 20 minutes after I got the bite and then I went to the hospital. The doctor there didn't even know what days they were supposed to administer the doses and kept confusing me but then he started writing the 4 dose vaccine again and I told him I already took it 2 months ago. Then he said I don't need anything and simply recommended me a tetanus shot. I took the tetanus shot but I'm growing increasingly paranoid. It's been almost 2 hours since that bite. I've checked on Google in some cases the wound is so tiny you need a magnifying glass to see it. This guy didn't even ask me where I was bitten, if I was bitten, if I bled, as soon as he heard cat bite he'd started writing. I don't know if I should trust him, I'm kind of a paranoid person.

Bihar government issued made it mandatory to have new pass issued from DM for new lockdown. The order was withdrawn as shown in the circular below as well as news clippings. My father had old pass from 1st part of lockdown since new one wasn't issued due to holiday yesterday and order being withdrawn by the government. Since government is so local police claimed traveling without Lockdown #2 pass is not allowed, hence the pass. 

My father works in bank and travels with his bike to work. Despite no problem other than minor stop and check during first phase of lockdown, he was stopped today and asked for pass and documents but even then Police fined him.

He was given 2 options  seizure of hi bike or pay challan. He paid the challan of course but fact remains he had necessary travel pass, a copy of government circular allowing his movement, his bank document.

If this is how so called ""essential workers"" are harassed, how will they do their work. But I shouldn't be surprised though given even doctors have been beaten, evicted and worse.

467,"[Please Advice] Reality punched me in the face today.Sorry Reddit, this post is going to be long. Please bear with me. Also using a throwaway account for privacy concerns.


This morning I woke up to the sounds of an argument between the landlord and my father. The landlord was asking us not to use one specific bathroom because it was leaking. The landlord is a pretty chill uncle, so I was surprised to hear him shouting.The argument was pretty one-sided though. So, I wake up and do my daily duties and that's when my mom comes to me to have a real talk. 

She says that we haven't paid the rent for about 8 months now and she figures that the landlord might ask us to vacate the place. She says your father hasn't been able to provide any income and shakingly admits that she's been asking relatives and people she knows money, to make ends meet.
She says that my education was supported by taking loans from relatives and that we're deep in debt, about 10 lakhs.

A little background about my family:
We're a family of three, my father moved to this city in 1995 because of his job (reputed company) and so did my mother after getting married. Things were going pretty good until 2005 when the company announced that they had to merge two branches and the branch in our city will be closed off. They were asking my father to transfer to another city, but keeping my education in mind my parents decided it's best for us to stay here, so my father resigned. My mother, a teacher, was also the earning member.
At this point in the story, my father is about 40 years old and my mother is around 33 years old and I'm 7 years old. My father lands a job in a different company, it's a different job than what he's used to, he doesn't like it. A few years later, the company is forced to close due to losses and my father was laid off. 
My father was unemployed for about a year and my mother became the primary earning member. She teaches Yoga as a home tutor. My mother handled things for a few years. Fast forward a few years, my father joins my uncle's company, a completely different job this time, and moves to a different city. It has been this way for about 7 years now, things were starting to get back on track, but my father left the job saying the bosses there suck and he can't lick their boots for a petty job. I was aware of this and I was in 4th year of my engineering at this time and I graduated a year later with a job in my hand. The job requires me to stay away from my home city and has a 1 year training period, after which I'll be considered an employee of the company. 

Cut to the question:
I was brought up without any of these circumstances affecting me, I never knew about all of this until today and that too only because the landlord came to have an argument and I happened to be awake at that time.

I really adore my mother and father, imagining how hard my mother worked to get me educated brings tears to my eyes. My mother cannot have a proper talk with father about his employment because she's afraid he might break down mentally. My dad is already very depressed (but he pretends he isn't) and also on the brink of his retirement age.I have a job now, and I'll be on the company payrolls as an employee from September.

I don't want my mother to struggle anymore, what can I do, as soon as possible to get rid of all these debts and how can I have some real talk with my father about this situation and how to handle it.",1586927948.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,81,429

Earlier before lockdown there were hardly double digit deaths.

How can people live life without taking vacation ever,thinking ten times of cost of eating at restaurant and working till retirement?And still people breed?And as far i have seen,parents spend their whole life in making their child stand on his own feet.Parents own  life is badly fucked up.And the children repeat this step.Even after this,India has large no of old age homes and 90% elders work to survive.It means parents don't save(or can't save) for their own future.And child is struggling for  making sufficient money.Most of the time people talk about money problems.Parents depend on child for care in old age and child is fucked up in earning sufficient money for his family and if he marries,then for his wife and child.Where does this go?

Wouldn't ""no sufficient money=no child planning "" will be helpful.Cost of raising a child is 67.4 lakh,approx.Why government just don't pass a bill saying people earning less than X amount can't have a child.Obviously, for few days public will be furious but atleast,India future will get better,isn't?

590,"I need help switching careerHey there! 

I hope you're all safe during the lockdown. 

I'm your typical engineer who's pursuing a degree in one of the core branches. And though I am not miserable at quantitative aptitude, I just feel I am not a cut out for doing that. I am literally scrapping through my engineering degree copying one assignment at a time and cheating my way through tests. I feel like an imposter and think of myself as a failure who's about to become an engineer without even knowing the basic concepts. 

My only passions are writing and somewhat web designing. I have monetized both of my passions and earn some spare change through that. Recently, I have been exploring journalism a lot and I feel that a media house is where I belong. I simply love the idea of giving a voice to people who are yearning to be heard. I want to cover stories, make documentaries, and write news features from the remotest places on this planet. 

Now, the problem is, due to my non-journalism background, no media house has ever reverted back to my emails asking for apprenticeship. I don't know how to switch careers and I need help and this pandemic doesn't make it any easier. Here are my main queries:

1. What do media companies (specially digital publications like VICE, The Wire etc) look for in an apprentice? 
2. How to build a journalism portfolio without having any formal training in it? 
3. How do I approach these companies? Should I slide inro HR's DMs (LinkedIn) or should I mail on their careers email? 
4. How to make this move a permanent one? Is an MA in journalism required? Should I move out of country to study? 

It would be so helpful if anyone of you can help me out. I am in a big fix and I want to change that.",1586908077.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,3

**Tl; dr**

In today‚Äôs speech announcing the extension of India‚Äôs national lockdown till 3rd May, 2020 the country‚Äôs Prime Minister requested citizens to [**download the** ***Aarogya Setu*** **application**](https://www.news18.com/news/tech/pm-modi-says-aarogya-setu-app-is-critical-in-the-fight-against-covid-here-is-how-it-works-2576857.html). Unfortunately, the application remains a privacy minefield and it does not adhere to principles of minimisation, strict purpose limitation, transparency and accountability. IFF‚Äôs Working Paper, analyses the application, highlights how it is inconsistent with the right to privacy, is conceivably a risk toward a permanent system of mass surveillance, and suggests clear recommendations to arrest these risks.

**Background**

On April 13, 2020 IFF released its working paper called, ¬†‚Äú[***Privacy Prescriptions for technology interventions on COVID-19 in India***](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UK5rElhcdP5T3Y-8fYP6cCgQKKpQBeOX/view)‚Äù. A significant portion of this working paper is dedicated to the proliferation of experimental contact tracing applications not just in India but across the world. India has also launched its own contact tracing solution called *Aarogya Setu*.

IFF‚Äôs working paper was alert to this and Chapters 5-7 devote significant space in studying the emergent government and non-government practices, standard setting processes and first principles in the space. Chapter 7 of the paper studies three specific models of contact tracing including the Singapore Government‚Äôs *Trace Together* application, MIT‚Äôs *Private Kit: Safe Paths* initiative, and *Aarogya Setu*.

**What is Contact Tracing?**

According to the WHO, contact tracing occurs in three steps namely (a) contact identification; (b) contact listing; and (c) contact follow up. In particular, contact tracing is a pillar which helps public health officials in containing and the pace of transmission of the virus. This pace of transmission is measured by the unit R0 (R naught) which essentially connotes the number of people an infected person can spread the disease onto.

Contact tracing has traditionally been administered through the use of on ground personnel and volunteer armies. However, with the ubiquity of smartphones, which collect vast troves of personal information, governments across the world believe surveillance can aid with rapid contact tracing. But owing to the peculiarities of the coronavirus, authorities across the world are beginning to realise the limited efficacy associated with respect to location surveillance (both with cell tower data and with GPS signals).   


As a result governments and other groups have either released or are developing smartphone apps that use Bluetooth beacons or GPS signals to log instances wherein a user‚Äôs device comes in contact with another user‚Äôs device. When a user of the app is detected to have Covid-19, contact tracing officers might be able to use the app to identify their close contacts in the prior days or weeks.  


**What‚Äôs the Risk?**   


With the creation of such systems, come new risks of institutionalisation of mass surveillance. Critically, India lacks a comprehensive data protection law, outdated surveillance and interception laws, or any meaningful proposals for meaningful reform. In domains like disaster relief, ¬†most apps which are purported as ‚Äòcontact tracing‚Äô technologies, they often devolve into systems of movement control and lockdown enforcement.

A lot of technology solutions with no demonstrable scientific value to the national response can be passed off as being in the public interest. It leads to poor deployment of public resources and also makes it difficult for crisis responders to discern between ‚Äúsnake oil‚Äù and quality technology products. These risks are exacerbated in technology markets since there are no adequate checks and balances in development phases which ensure quality.

Such systems inadvertently discriminate against regions which have fewer concentrations of smartphones. Specifically, it can lead to harmful outcomes for people residing in economically weaker areas. In countries public health systems are already creaking under the looming threat of capacity deficits. If such systems wrongly urge people to pre-emptively take tests then there is a risk that public health systems may be overwhelmed prematurely.

It may also exacerbate the risks associated with the harvesting of personal data like health information, and also see the creation of new privacy invasive systems.

**How to prevent these risks?**

Such systems must consider embedding the following principles among others:

1. The usage of these applications should be voluntary
2. All data should always be stored locally on people‚Äôs devices
3. This data must be encrypted
4. No Government can access it at a later point, so must ensure nothing is centralised in a server
5. Governments must appreciate that any data from location information, to proximity confirmations, to health status, to whether they have been placed in isolation is sensitive personal information.
6. Privacy by design is more than just assurances that phone numbers are not recorded, all data is encrypted, pseudonymisation is deployed or that the use of the app is ‚Äúvoluntary‚Äù and based on consent. Most of these protections have known techniques of circumvention.  


Therefore, we need to adhere to two principles:

1. Strict limits ¬†(in terms of collection and duration )every step of the way; and
2. Comprehensive evidence-based justifications every step of the way

**Aarogya Setu compares unfavourably to Singapore and MIT**

https://preview.redd.it/0zw655ssbss41.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=488f2ca51d6a194e6858495a346eb42e072a2d5b

Consider the following aspects.

**Is this for disease control or for other purposes?**

In other countries, health authorities are leading the efforts to respond to COVID-19. For example, in Singapore only its health ministry can use these systems or have access to any limited data/interaction which is shared with them. European authorities are making similar commitments. They assure citizens that law enforcement personnel will not have access to these systems or the data therein.

In India, multiple committees have been set up in the context of *Aarogya Setu* or other technology responses to the coronavirus. But formal notifications nor press reports have any reference to major involvement of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Instead health authorities are being tertiary institutional players.

To protect people‚Äôs right to privacy, countries (including Singapore) say that contact tracing will be used strictly for disease control and cannot be used to enforce lockdowns or quarantines. ***Aarogya Setu*** **retains the flexibility to do just that, or to ensure comply legal orders and so on**.

**Minimisation? What Minimisation?**

1. Singapore monitors people‚Äôs interactions through Bluetooth beacons, MIT does it through GPS, and **then there‚Äôs India which uses both**.
2. Other apps just collect one data point which is subsequently replaced with a scrubbed device identifier. India‚Äôs Aarogya Setu **collects multiple data points** for personal and sensitive personal information which increases privacy risks.

&#x200B;

**No Transparency leads to discretion**

The only information we have of the app is its frontend and its rather pedestrian Terms of Service (TOS) and Privacy Policy. Other projects release as much information as possible in pursuit of transparency. This may include an accompanying manifesto, technical specifications, general FAQs, and even its source code. Not only does *Aarogya Setu* go the opposite route but it also prohibits external good faith actors from reverse engineering the application for further scrutiny, information security and other related research which help facilitate stability.

Similarly, the app is capable of wrongfully identifying people as COVID-19 positive as admitted in the app‚Äôs Terms of Service. We ask in our report the question in our paper, does this mean people can get diagnosed as being infected with coronavirus based on an application rather than an actual medical test? Similarly, does this mean that a false positive entails that I cannot use public transport and go to work or leave the city to visit friends? This evokes imagery of the Chinese model of surveillance during COVID-19 and we have highlighted these risks as well in the report.

**No Accountability and No Auditability**

The Government has a blanket liability limitation clause inserted into its service agreements and privacy policies. This means citizens cannot hold the Government accountable or seek judicial remedy should they wish to ensure the Government‚Äôs processes are compliant with the right to privacy.

Second, the Government talks about certain obligations to delete certain personal data from its application after a 30 day time period. However, as expected this claim comes with enough exceptions which facilitate government discretion. This is compounded with the fact that both researchers and individual users cannot actually check if the Government has deleted people‚Äôs personal information and has no means of transparently auditing what the app is doing in the backend.

**Risk of Permanence and Compromises to Autonomy | The Anonymisation Gambit**

Finally, the app runs very palpable risks of either expanding in scope or becoming a permanent surveillance architecture. People are describing the current times as 9/11 on steroids. And with 9/11 we saw the creation and proliferation of mass interception capabilities for some governments. The Government has failed to provide any defined period by when it intends to review, delete and ultimately destroy its systems and data which is collected under the *Aarogya Setu* project. Second, there are already reports which confirm that this server is being linked with other government datasets. Such linking increases risks of permanent systems of mass surveillance.

Finally, the Government says that the TOS and Privacy Policy do not apply in any capacity to what falls under the category of anonymised data sets. The government cannot just say something is anonymised and aggregated so no longer personally identifiable without showing its citizens how it is ensuring this. This level of transparency is a minimum, since the vulnerability of anonymised datasets to people‚Äôs informational privacy and security is well documented in information security communities. Considering the risk of these anonymised data sets becoming permanent systems of data analysis, the Government has to keep itself accountable to public scrutiny.

**Conclusion**

IFF has addressed all of these challenges and many more when undertaking its case studies, and the paper eventually sets out a series of 17 recommendations to ensure people‚Äôs informational privacy are protected even in these uncertain times, wherein Indian authorities are viewing civil liberties as an afterthought.

932,"Economists of r/India , can you give your views or comments on inflation in India and it's relationship to unemployment . Read details belowRecently , I was reading an article on inflation and unemployment

>A.W. Phillips was one of the first economists to present compelling evidence of the inverse relationship between unemployment and wage inflation. Phillips studied the relationship between unemployment and the rate of change of wages in the United Kingdom over a period of almost a full century (1861-1957), and he¬†discovered that the latter could be explained by (a) the level of unemployment¬†and (b) the rate of change of unemployment.

>Phillips hypothesized that when demand for labor is high¬†and there are few unemployed workers, employers can be expected to bid wages up quite rapidly. However, when demand for labor is low,¬†and unemployment is high, workers are reluctant to accept lower wages than the prevailing rate, and as a result, wage rates fall very slowly.

>A¬†second factor that affects wage rate changes is the rate of change in unemployment. If business is booming, employers will bid more vigorously for workers, which means that demand for labor is increasing at a fast¬†pace (i.e., percentage unemployment is decreasing rapidly), than they would if the demand for labor were either not increasing (e.g., percentage unemployment is unchanging) or only increasing at a slow pace.

Does this mean the current government's quest for low inflation is indirectly leading to unemployment going up .

Low inflation means companies and investors have no initiative to invest . However during times of inflation , investors look for places to invest their money in since it will keep on losing its  value if it kept ideal .

During Congress years of 2004-2014 , high inflation also most probably lead to increased consumer spending and expenditure. Since a large sector of Indian economy is dependent on internal consumption , it experienced significant growth due to it 


The reserve bank of India has been also extremely focused on fighting inflation . Many people are saying that this obsession with inflation is causing them to keep interest rates too high , as a result of which private companies have no initiative to borrow loans for new ventures


>As these examples of hyperinflation show, states have a powerful incentive to keep price rises in check. For the past century in the U.S., the approach has been to manage inflation using¬†monetary policy. To do so, the¬†Federal Reserve¬†(the U.S.¬†central bank)¬†relies¬†on the relationship between¬†inflation and interest rates. If¬†interest rates¬†are low, companies and individuals can borrow cheaply to start a business, earn a degree, hire new workers, or buy a shiny new boat. In other words, low rates encourage spending and investing, which generally stoke inflation in turn.By raising interest rates, central banks can put a damper on these rampaging¬†animal spirits

But he couldn't Google anything to back up his point, but he has some valid reasons, including some points from older books and quotes from Thiruvalluvar. My other friend says that we should just follow what ever the government has decided as they would have done more research on this matter, therefore 14 April is Tamil New Year.


I was having a hard time to research on this as I can't read/write Tamil, and Google wasn't helpful either. Would love to see any historians to shed some light in this matter for clarification, also any English sources that I can learn more of India's history.


I would appreciate if anyone can point me to some trustable resources (preferably in English). Some people say it's a political agenda, that is what Karunanidhi tried to change.

> According to BMC, the most number of coronavirus cases have been reported from slum pockets and similar highly dense areas of Mumbai. The G South ward of the BMC has got 78 cases - the largest in the city. In this ward, most of the patient are reported from fishermen colony of Worli, Prabhadevi and Lower Parel.

> The D ward which has Byculla in its limits has got the second-highest number of cases. Localities such as Dharavi, Kurla, Nehru Nagar, Bandra and Andheri too have a significant number of positive cases.

> ""We are more worried and concerned about the health workers and doctors who have been tested coronavirus positive. In Mumbai, more than 50 people from the medical fraternity are detected as virus-positive. The community spreading has therefore started as we see a surge in a number of cases from various parts of the city. They have neither international travel history nor immediate contact. We are declaring these areas as contaminated cluster and subsequently sealing them,"" sais senior BMC officer.

To my own fault of forgetting to wear a mask, I was stopped by a cop in civillian clothing and was asked what I was doing outside, to which I stated my reason and then was asked why I was not wearing a mask and told him the truth. I was then struck by the cop with a swat bat thingy thrice at that point, I decided to floor my bike and dipped out of there at fool speed. 

I can't help but rationlize why I was struck. My friend says that I was assaulted by the cop because he says that it wasn't the right for the cop to hit me, as he was also stopped by a cop when he was walking his dog for not wearing a mask. He then stated his reasons and then the cops told him to wear a mask and started petting his dog (My friend btw, is Indian and lives in a Middle Eastern country). Was it right for the cop to strike me? I can't help but think from both perspectives and always end up thinking that maybe I should've worn a mask, and this whole thing wouldn't have happened. What do you guys think?

Edit: Thank you guys for clearing up my views on the situation of what I had gone through. I didn't mention this but, I am sort of new to India, I came here like last year to complete my UG, so I didn't take into account that the Indian cops might have different perspective as compared to the cops where I was raised (i.e, Middle East). I admit that I was in the wrong for not wearing a mask, however, I don't think it was the right thing to do for the cop to hit me considering I showed him proof of reason as to why I was outside in the first place. 

Neither do I think that the cop had the best intentions in mind as I think he would've conveyed his point in a better way by actually telling me to wear a mask first. As far as I've heard, the cops in this country are far from the best but I shouldn't judge them individually based on what I may have heard but I cannot deny what I've heard or read anyway.",1586836361.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,84,146

A lot of you have messaged us with ideas on what we should do next & some of you have joined our team as well to make things happen faster. The activity we have seen on our Telegram and WhatsApp groups has been heart-warming, where the members have effectively built a crowdsourced repository of things to watch, read and do at home. 

Our interactions with the community as well as with my own family members has given me the feeling that while people have been figuring out ways to keep themselves entertained, what has become more crucial to them is the need to stay informed.

So that everyone can stay informed and updated, with verified stats and news, we are launching [IndiaSmile **Corona Around You**](https://indiasmile.org/covid). This one page contains everything you need to follow the growth of this virus worldwide, delivered in a super-performant intuitive UI and regularly updated.

It contains:

* National & Local Covid Statistics -- Find the **statistics of your state, directly**.
* Global Covid Statistics -- Compare how other countries are doing, worldwide.
* National Testing Data -- **Follow India‚Äôs testing capacity**. As of the time of writing this post, India has tested a very small % of its population. See the graph to know how the government is dealing with this issue. 
* Regular News related to Covid -- all from verified sources, vetted by our team
* Distance to nearest covid case from your location -- Uses district-level data to **find the nearest infected case from you**, and provides a distance.
* Charts to monitor & compare date wise historical data -- Hover or click on charts to get more info.

While designing this page we paid special attention to neat UI/UX and wanted to deliver information in an easy to consume manner, so that every Indian, even if they are not tech savvy, can stay informed.

We are open to feedback, ideas & thoughts on how to improve this so that this can become an even better resource for people to stay updated. IndiaSmile is 100% non-profit and open source!

1062,"My Tata Nano turned 5 today. I thought of sharing a few pictures and a perspective on this marvel of frugal engineering.I purchased a Tata Nano in 2015, 2 years into my first job. This car turned 5 today, and what a great companion it has been. We have other cars in the family, but this one remains my favorite, and even my dad loves it. It is super-nimble and comfortable, in fact, more comfortable than my Hyundai Xcent (I bought it in 2018 because it runs on CNG and is very cheap to run). The Nano seats in the front were designed for people who are 6 footers, and everyone gets surprised to be able to stretch their legs.

Looks like new after 5 years

The Nano is amongst the most famous Indian engineering products globally. Yes, a lot of folks in India shun the car because it ""makes them feel cheap"" and they'd rather buy a 3 lakh rupee bike or an expensive car on EMI to look cool. But when I did my MBA abroad, the Nano was the only Indian case study that was taught. People abroad love to investigate the innovations in the Nano, and at the same time look at it as a marketing failure because it did not highlight the ""aspirational value"" associated with owning a car in India.

5 years of ownership experience has been great. Tata service in the area I live in is superb- better than Hyundai and Maruti. They take the car from our house for service and deliver it back at no extra cost.

The Nano is a marvel, not only because of its price but because of the space it offers and the extremely innovative packaging. You won't feel tired even after full-day drives, which is not the case in most small cars. The AC is superb, the fuel efficiency is around 14 in the city and over 20 on highways.

Some people say that the ""nano is unsafe and I'd rather travel in an Uber than be seen driving one"". I have never been in an accident in one, but I don't exceed 60-70kph on any road, and try being as careful a driver as the road allows. Airbags would have been great

I wish Tata takes the lessons of the Nano forward and brings out more innovative products. Sadly, in India, innovation does not sell. People are more concerned about looking rich.

If you're looking for an inexpensive used car, the Nano is a great option. It costs around a lakh for models produced after 2015, and you will get a reliable, reasonably comfortable car that is a joy to drive on city roads. Avoid the cars made before 2012, because they had niggling issues. Thanks for reading.",1586858227.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,53,228

I am currently in Bangalore and my mom's treatment is undergoing in BMS hospital. The doctor prescribed two tests to know level of infection but due to lockdown next day only, it couldn't be done. Now that hospital's lab person is saying I need to wait till end of the second phase of lockdown. The particular tests(HBV DNA QUANT, SAFP and other tests) are cheaper in this hospital due to tie up with NGO. If I get these done in other hospital, I need to spend three to four times more money. With no job currently and already bad financial condition, it's really a nightmare for me. I called government hospitals also but they are not doing any test due to COVID. It's not safe to take her to crowded hospital as she has diabetes also. Please tell me what should I do in this situation. The doctor told us to get the test urgently as situation is too critical. If you stay in Bangalore and know where I can get these tests in less cost, kindly let me know. Thank you for reading till the end.üôè

If any doctor is seeing this please tell what is the reason the sodium level went this much low. Is there any connection with the lever problem? She vomits every 15 days, subsequently sodium level drops and don't know why it is happening. Sodium level below 120 is life threatening.

1073,"Key takeaways from PM Narendra Modi‚Äôs address to the nations at 10 AM on 14th April 2020.## Key points said
- Nation's fighting well, thanks to you folk's sacrifice. ""We the people of India"" means exactly this [Starting till 4 minutes in speech].
- India started screening for COVID before the first case. At 100 cases, we started isolation. At 500 cases, we did a lockdown for 21 days [6 minutes in speech]
- It's unfair to compare with other countries. However, if we compare, India is at a relatively good standing (by around _25 to 30 times_). [8 minutes in speech]. The lockdown and social distancing was expensive but worth it. Still, _the rate of spread is alarming_ [10 minutes in speech].
- Citizens, state governments, bodies have suggested and some have _already_ implemented an extension to lockdown. **Lockdown has been extended till 3rd May 2020** (under the _same circumstances and conditions_). [12 minutes in speech].
- We have to avoid the spread of COVID in regions. Death due to this must be even more worrisome. _We must stay vigilant with current and emerging hotspots_. New hotspots will bring problems. 
    - **Stronger constraints and implementation of lockdown till 20th April 2020**. Essential services and operations can resume for areas of lower risks (under conditions for going out). _If any traces of COVID, the lockdown shall be reimposed_. [16 minutes in speech].
- _A guideline shall be released by tomorrow_ (_15th April 2020_). Major steps are taken to _help the poor and needy_. The government has helped them through various funds, specially farmers. There are efforts being made for helping farmers, supply chain is being improved [18 minutes in speech]
- We've already organized over 1L hospital beds and 600+ COVID hospitals. Scientists are encouraged to help in these times of crisis [20 minutes in speech].

### Help needed in 7 areas 
The public is encouraged to focus on the following areas [start 22 minutes in speech]:

1. _Extra care of the elderly_ in the house
2. **Obey lockdown**. Use **homemade** masks.
3. Improve immunity.
4. Download ""Aarogya Setu"" [mobile app](https://www.mygov.in/aarogya-setu-app/) and encourage others to download it.
5. Help the poor and needy
6. Don't terminate employment of workers under you
7. Respect the front line workers (police, healthcare professionals, etc.)

**Please follow the above till 3 May 2020** [till 24 minutes in speech].


## Key points observed:
- PM Narendra Modi were wearing a mask which was a muffler (*Not an N95 respirator or a surgical mask*) in the beginning of the address.
- _Started at 10 AM_ and went on _till 10:25 AM_ on 14th April 2020.",1586841578.0,,Coronavirus,dark,159,1026

This continuity and impossibility generates an illusion of political progress whereas it is only appropriation and manipulation of the same. When someone asks to dismantle the Centre, they are asking not to do this identity based inclusion as a political goal but attack the very system (Capitalism) that is facilitating it.

1276,"Comparison of expressway/motorway system of India/Pakistan/ChinaIf we take a look at the expressway system of India and China and the motorway system of Pakistan, a lot of differences can be seen. 

&#x200B;

The length of operational expressways in **India** stands at 1,642.5¬†km: [https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png](https://i.imgur.com/FscRCi3.png)

The length of operational motorways in **Pakistan** stands at 2,350 km: [https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png](https://i.imgur.com/KdZpPbW.png) (only the operational sections have been included in the calculations)

Whereas, the length of operational expressways in **China** stands at 142,500 km as of 2018 with planned expansion to 168,478 km by 2020, the list is as follows:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NTHS_Expressways)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Regional\_Expressways\_of\_China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Regional_Expressways_of_China) [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_auxiliary\_NTHS\_Expressways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_auxiliary_NTHS_Expressways) 

&#x200B;

As it can be seen, the operational length in all three countries is drastically different. While China and India have a similar population, China has a far longer expressway system which tends to be designed more efficiently (fewer accidents) with better quality (more durable, more stops along the way with more facilites) and more lanes in general. Pakistan, on the other hand, has 1/6th the population of India but has a longer motorway system but still, it is far behind China.

This isn't a very fair comparison as there are more things to consider, Pakistan has a worse railway system than India and fewer airports even after adjusting for population. Some motorways in Pakistan are of better quality than India but some are in worse condition like the half-completed M-8 motorway and the M-9 and M-10 motorways aren't of a similar quality. China, on the other hand, has a far better railway system, more airports, etc. than both India and Pakistan. Although, India and Pakistan are both working on their respective railway systems, they are still behind (Pakistan is taking China's help in doing so). The need for longer expressways in China is crucial as it's more than 3 times the size of India (controlled area of 9,634,205 sq km vs  3,166,391 sq km) while some high-speed railway routes aren't as beneficial (but China still funds high-speed railway lines which lead to losses due to integration of far-off provinces) because of longer distances in some areas like in USA where airplanes are more preferred.",1586790203.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,12

I  made a simple portal, where people looking for jobs or providing  services can put in their info. Similarly people who are able to hire  people for paid work can put in their requirements.

I  have a few responses till now, but nothing substantial. If you are  looking/might be looking for jobs/gigs in the near future please fill it  in :)

Or if you own a business, and need to hire someone, here \^  is the  link.

Again,  I don't think it will do much good ASAP. But over the course of months,  as the lockdown is lifted, it could help bolster the local economy  again

ALSO. Any suggestions are welcome!

(I'll keep improving it, if other devs want to join in, it'd be awesome too, we'll keep it open source and free)

I ran numbers in different ways and realised that it's not worth the price you pay. I also found a specific kilometre number (kind of like break even for car usage) if you drive above it annually then it makes sense to go for car otherwise not.

It's easy to get a car when going out with friends or family (zoomcar etc) if you need to commute to office then two wheeler or cabs or autos are sufficient that's what I feel.

\[1\]:  [A letter to Anand Teltumbde, on his way to jail](https://scroll.in/article/958222/a-letter-to-anand-teltumbde-on-his-way-to-jail)

They were framed in Bhima Koregaon case which you all know was transferred to centre (NIA) recently. IIMA Students/faculty wrote a letter to supreme court asking  inquiry into Prof Teltumbde arrest. They was charged under Unlawful activities act which was approved in 2019 and involves no conviction or trial. And the cases were transferred because they not longer had government in Maharashtra.

\[2\] Letter: [Statement of solidarity to Anand Teltumbe and Gautam Navlakha](https://caravanmagazine.in/noticeboard/statement-of-solidarity-to-acquit-anand-teltumbde)

And Dalits activists are far more threatening to BJP than english-speaking comedians. They've been trying their best to get these two arrested and we saw how they arrested Azad. We can't lose this battle. BJP never forms strong opinion about anti-caste movement because votes from a oppressed group is cheap and comes in massive numbers.

\[3\]. ['I Don‚Äôt See Any Anti-Caste Movement Today': Anand Teltumbde](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEk9JUlIQTU)

Now, finally how were they framed?

Firstly, the police claimed that they provocative speech in the Elgar Parishad event which led to violence. This wasn't proven and then they accused them of having maoist links and planning to assassinate Modi. They remotely placed letters containing ill-intent against constitution on their laptop which indicated such things. Few agencies including Amnesty and Caravan found out these irregularities. The police presented their laptops to the court and court declared them guilty.

If you're smart in politics/caste-system/tech all of you have reasons to dig into the case. And raise awareness around you. If you've friends in IIMA, they can provide you with more accurate info. The students involved are from 2-3 batches. But in any case, do learn about the whole thing happening here. They'll be arrested on Ambedkar Jayanti.

1501,"Need help ... (Repost from r/AskPsychiatry)I'm sorry for the repost but I'm really miserable right now and don't know what to do ... And how am I gonna access a psychiatrist ...

Please help me ... If any one here is a psychiatrist or in this field .. please advise me on what to do 


It started a few days ago , I was fine and doing well Until I watched a movie about someone being falsely accused , I got intrusive thoughts that I might get falsely accused too , and my fear was escalated when I realised that I have a pretty suspicious post history on reddit and search history too , so I got really scared that I'd be falsely accused , so I did a few Google searches about weather or not i'm being tracked by the government or not , and it came with scary search results so my intrusive thoughts shifted to being spied on and falsely accused at the same time , now I don't have a lot of friends but I really value the few friends I have so I was scared that this would hurt my reputation and I would lose my current friends and not be able to make new friends either .. then later on I got so anxious and thought ""what if I am actually a criminal ? The idea didn't bother me at first but then I googled ""surpressed memories"" and I got pretty scared as well , and had the thought that I might be actually a horrible criminal and have surpressed memories of it because I cant remember doing anything bad .... I had additional intrusive thoughts as well like this world being a hallucination and that maybe in reality I'm doing some terrible things .... I was extremely scared and had a lot of anxiety ... Then later on it shifted to my current fear .. That is going to *** .... This fear is based on a dream I had a few months ago I had a dream that my life would crumble down.... And that I'd be rejected by everyone and that I'd never reach my loved ones .... I was really going through panic in my dream ... And was contemplating suicide or drugs too .... There was a figure in that dream that resembled ryuk from the anime death note ... Who was mocking me about my fate.....Right now I feel similar to that dream ..... But I have reasons to believe that this might be true Because I've been noticing various signs like scary typos while typing and ads with specific wordings etc and events like me bringing a new charger and it not working afterwords ... And me having to lay down in a specific position so it charges while using it ... Having to eat bad food etc and My mom acting weird I saw two other anime called hell girl and Babylon which scared me too ... Because both plots resemble what I'm going through I'm really anxious at this point and don't know what to do .... I'm scared and always have a feeling like I'm being watched .... I even thought to myself that if I wear this specific clothing then something scary would happen and well ... I saw the hell girl cast and had a ""hallucination"" of making a deal with the devil .. or taking a loan from a hell bank now I'm scared of going to a bank or taking out a loan I was interested in anime and now I'm scared of it .... I was interested in banking stuff and now I'm scared .... Even now I'm witnessing scary typos too .... I don't know what to do... One reason I'm scared of getting help is because ... I think that if I let my guard down or feel relieved ... Something terrible would happen ... And in Babylon ... Help from nowhere worked for the protagonist almost .... This seems similar to me .. and I'm scared of it and hope it's not .... 


Even now I'm witnessing scary signs like word suggestions , scary co incidences , someone with the username ""naively idealistic"" messaged me with kind words ... This seemed like a supernatural warning .... One thing I forgot to mention is that a main character in hell girl three vessels saw her ambitions crumble and her succeeding the hellgirl .... I don't want this to happen with me ..

Fuck I'm even having scary medical symptoms  and disturbing  typos and  signs as if telling me to not Talk about this .... .. This all seems so scary and frightening ... I'm really scared please help me

Edit : it seems to keep on getting scarier ...


Edit : I'm scared of feeling even slightly relieved or talking about this because im scared of its  repucussions if any.. it's really frightening ..

Edit : I felt a strong earthquake that seems like only I felt , idk what this was .... Now I'm really scared even more ...

Edit : just remembered that there was another character in hellgirl who was accused of something and sent to hell , don't know if falsely or not ... Now I'm even more scared..

Edit : since I seem to be more concerned about being accused... And at times I'm not much anxious.... I'm really scared.... Fuck ... I am more scared about being accused ... I don't know .... What If I appeared like a manipulator or appeared normal to a psychiatrist ?.... 

Edit : what if I'm looking like one right now ? Please .... I'm suffering .... I'm not lying about being anxious ...

Edit : more scary signs and scary thoughts ... For example ""I'm going"" and ""I'm goin"" was in a text bar ... And my phone discharged too ... And some scary  warning etc  kind of typos ..... Even when typing now ( oof more typos) and non typos in some sentences .. even now scary signs

Edit : The earthquake was in Delhi  my area 
.... The epicenter too .... Which is scary ... Inmany ways

Edit : many of the themes in that anime seem really scary and similar .... Like regret etc ....and people sending others to hell but realising their mistakes since they go to hell too .... By doing so... And other situations leading to them regretting their decisions .... I'm getting so many scary typos and signs while typing this ...

Edit : I had  a dream when I was sleeping recently about being a big criminal on the run ... And I had a dream about reading about hellgirl on Wikipedia and how disturbing it is and Hell is , I had a negative dream again wearing the same sheet ... That I wore when I had my previous negative dreams .... It's so frightening .... And I had so many scary typos typing this.... Edit of this edit : the typos were really scary like warnings even now I think 


Edit : I'm still seeing scary signs etc .... For example a sinister smile shape in a cup of tea etc .... I'm really scared .... Im scared that maybe   innocent people can be sent to hell too.  

Edit : I saw something related to the thing I think I should have avoided .... Related to banking kind of ... And I'm scared I made the wrong decision by doing so maybe ... Even my phone discharged before .... For many minutes .... Im  scared that maybe this is a pattern or symbolic or manipulated ...

Edit : still witnessing scary signs

Edit : the second previous edit is scaring me ... I'm scared that maybe I shouldn't have seen stuff related to banking ... Because it seems so symbolic and patterned

Edit : I remember being really jelous of my cousin ... And hating him ... In hell girl you can send people to hell like i said .... I don't want to be in that situation .... I have an ambition that I'm afraid of having crumbled ..... I'm unable to put it in words right now and that's what scares me because of the repucutions if any ... Of it ... I'm having negative thoughts of my close people betraying me ..... Or looking like they betrayed me or crumbling my ambition ... And i doing something terrible like sending them to hell .... And going to hell as well .... I'm seriously scared ..... 

Edit : I even had scary medical symptoms again ....
 

Edit : I'm sorry to everyone who I've wished hell and anything bad on .... I'm sorry ..... 

Edit : I tried to copy paste this to 7 cups forums but it didn't work.... I wonder what it could mean 

Edit : I saw some things ..
 That I'm scared of there .... Now I'm scared ... I don't even wanna talk about it but I'm scared that this means something and might have repucutions ....

Edit : I'm scared almost everytime and scared that I'm being watched supernaturally ....

Edit : soooooooooo I was watching hentai ... And a poster had the username ""lifeanddeathsworld"" and another ""deadstar"" ... Scary....",1586762100.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,23,4

After this lockdown ends, I'll have to dive headfirst into a chaotic world, which will likely leave me with two options - getting a job or prepping for MBA. I'm currently in the final semester of a BBA program.

I don't want to end up in a corporate set-up. I sometimes doubt whether that's just because I'm shirking responsibility or I lack ambition but I think I have a few things figured out that I don't want to compromise on - reading and keeping a healthy life (which for me is basically an hour of running and basic exercises) and also that I don't care much for things like say, a car or a huge-ass house.

Keeping these things in mind, I wish to figure out a career which affords me this kind of a lifestyle and there's a balance between my interest in the job & the pay that I'll be getting from working it. Now that I've written it down, it sounds like it's too much to ask for but I believe it isn't entirely impossible. Would really appreciate ideas helping me move forward in this direction, thanks!",1586744843.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,6

1525,"My experiment with using bumble in India.So guys this is gonna be a bit long.                                                               
So basically I was super bored with the quarantine and I was talking to my girlfriend about random stuff. So something about online dating came up. I made a bumble profile with 3 decent pictures , a good bio ,also verified account. Guess how many matches I got ( 2 in an hour and 4 likes lol) . Bear in mind both my girlfriend and I are about a solid 9 facially  (she's a bit better maybe) but my body is  a bit above average (good frame)with slight muscle but nothing too great, but I'm on the shorter side about  5'7(I'm in South Delhi) But I certainly expected waay better results based on real life experience, I really didn't know how bad the competition is.  I wanted to see how demographics are skewed so I asked my girlfriend to send  3 random selfies  for experimenting , also none of these were taken with a proper camera(just front camera selfies) without the best lighting. Also I had no bio besides a question and my profile was unverified.  I swiped to mostly hot guys 8+, and had a 90% match rate( ridiculous). All these guys looked like models  were tall , had bodies I'd assume from more than a year of solid gymming , had great photos taken by probably a professional camera and great bio and in general had a lot of effort put on their profile all to match with a low effort unverified profile.I got 350+ likes and 100+ matches in about an hour ,hour and a half I was basically bamboozled with disparity of likes even though both of us are similarly attractive. I understand the complaints of a lot of Indian guys on bumble etc about not getting matches, but the fault is on guys and especially Indian guys y'all way too thirsty and have no or extremely low standards( bumble doesn't have a lot of white guys, almost none) the pedestalising of girls is insane. You're basically competing with Indian version of ""Chad"" if you call that if you do use online dating. The average Indian guy isn't attractive but online  there's a shit ton of ""hot"" guys in North India and most are on tinder/bumble so you'd probably get close to no matches, let alone decent ones and thats even if you're above average and have put a lot of effort in your profile. A girl in India on online dating is basically God mode. So anyone here even if you're hot guy  ( You'll probably lose your value since hot guys are dime a dozen here and fucks up the standards of all girls in general.), if you want to go for online dating.   Don't.  
1. It basically spoils the notion of love in an insane way. Basically makes it a number game which is Frankly ridiculous to me. Someone with 100+ hot guys in their profile won't be able to emotionally attach ,let alone choose between who they want. It's one of the reason is never wanted to date online even after way too many of my friends told me to. It's near impossible to find love where there isn't real time energy or connection involved.  

2. It raises the standards of even somewhat decent girls to an unattainable level for most guys who meet her and even hot guys , since all they have to do to find a hot guy is install and app an swipe. Men are probably as expendable as ever. In real life attractive people you actually come across and interact with and get along with is rare and that what makes is special(chance for a spark).  Online dating basically just gives you a plethora of these attractive people sitting at home  reducing the chances of someone being special to you way less and having a moment of actual chance encounters.(I met my girlfriend in a library, Sorry I'm a hopeless romantic)

1567,"What are your thoughts on arranged marriage? And marrying someone with history of mental illness?I think that it is very important that a person reveals about their physical and mental health issues before marriage. Otherwise it will essentially be lying / withholding information.

Most of my friends married without revealing their struggles. I am talking about both male and female friends, from big cities and towns as well.

Obviously I don't know where they will be five or ten years from now. But as of now things seem to be going well.

Obviously I don't really know what exactly is going on in their personal lives.

The mental struggles do manifest although, and could be kept hidden for only so long.

I believe that some illnesses although are more severe than others, especially those illnesses that require antipsychotic medicines. As they can cause sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction.

So this could severely impact the quality of sex life of the couple. 

Other than that the mental struggles tend to be genetic. So the offspring is likely to have some positive or negative abnormalities. But it could be really positive too, as relatives of people with mental health issues can often be high achievers as well.

I myself have lived a life of honesty, so I never hide. Although people are quick to assume about the severity of the illness. And they being to imagine dramatic images of people who struggle with these illness.

So, it tends to become a conflict of interest.

So some people decide to keep things to themselves, because others might exaggerate for fun. And it might lead to them being Ostracized. 

I personally am not a big fan of marriage or seeking companionship etc although I want to conform with the social norms to some degree. And there always is interest of family members as well.

1576,"Do Indian restaurants actually use yeast to leaven naans?Short version:

A  naan's crumb  seems to be just an airy bubbly layer and a bottom layer,  it is almost hollow in the middle, no bready glutenous structures,  image for reference: [https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/u5e24alw59d41.jpg)   This makes me believe that it is not leavened with yeast but just  getting a lean flour on a high enough heat that seals the deal, so a phulka like internal structure, but with tandoor's heat you'd have the air bubbles in a phulka which collapse by the time you flip, actually crisped enough by the heat  to stay like that?

Long version:

I'm  experimenting with trying  to recreate naans similar to restaurants in  India, which I believe is primarily the trick of tandoors. While most  recipes do the yeast/yogurt, the end result always for me is closer to a  bread having the crumb of a pita and shape of a naan. I've seen   restaurants in European countries also do this, so I guess they leaven   with yeast, and this is relatively easier to recreate in home  conditions, this was my attempt [https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/T9jCnms.jpg)

Going  back to naans in India however, the crumb is more of a very airy   structure, with just the top & bottom layers, importantly it doesn't  at all actually have bready interiors like a pita,  a perfect example  is [https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally\_got\_my\_hand\_on\_some\_real\_naan\_and\_roti/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breadit/comments/euj3ov/finally_got_my_hand_on_some_real_naan_and_roti/)

The   post there claims that the bread only contained flour water &  salt,  no diary and importantly no leavening.  The more I'm  understanding a  bit about bread etc, the more I'm feeling it is just  the heat of the  tandoor oven and just a lean flour, maybe with a bit of  yogurt for  flavor /soda and not a yeast bread. Does anyone have links  to  videos/recipes from actual Indian restaurants? Most youtube videos  are  all from home cooks, where the recipe is either yeast/ baking   soda/powder, but trying all of them still gives a more ""breadier""  crumb   to naan, while I'm actually thinking naan is more similar to a tawa   roti's crumb, except that the internal heat in a tandoor can crisp the   top fast enough to stay there, while a tawa roti/phulka has a great air   bubble while roasting, but it doesn't sustain. I experimented this with   my sourdough discard for a bit of flavour and a soft wheat high gluten   flour (don't have atta) , so I did get a lot of bubbles similar to   naans, however, it didn't stay after flipping, similar to how a   chappati/roti on griddle would have bubbles, but don't survive to stay   bubbled. [https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ](https://imgur.com/a/Fj9PhUJ) ,

So   I guess a high enough heat to sustain the top surface heat would mean   that you could get away without actually leavening with yeast, or the   restaurants may use a bit of yesterday's dough which would mean a   sourdough style natural yeast doing the leavening?

## Tl;dr

With a view to address the public health challenges due to Covid-19 a range of technology interventions are being developed that impact personal privacy. We at IFF have been watching it with concern and have authored a comprehensive working paper to inform public policy formation in India. ¬†This includes a substantive analysis of the use and publication of health data, specific development of surveillance technologies around location tracking and finally the deployment of contact tracing through handheld device applications.

We devote substantial space to a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore‚Äôs TraceTogether, MIT‚Äôs Private Kit : Safe Path‚Äôs Project and Aarogya Setu. We also consider the possible public policy and rights related ramifications of the recent announcement of a partnership between Apple and Google towards contact tracing. ¬†To conclude we make substantial prescriptions premised primarily on the legal framework of the Indian Supreme Court‚Äôs developing jurisprudence on the fundamental right to privacy. Over this week, we are going through a series of posts explaining how we can protect our health and privacy at the same time. It's possible if we try!

## Re-framing the Privacy and Public Health trade-off

The world seems like a distressing place right now irrespective of the number of pick-me up videos from celebrities and influencers. A reason for this worry includes the substantial erosion of civil liberties such as the freedom of assembly and movement due to the advice from policy makers to maintain social distancing due to the Covid-19 pandemic. In these extraordinary times, it is very likely that the lockdown may not be a permanent feature of life and we again be able to meet our friends, family and colleagues in person.

However, there are repeated warnings that some systems which are being developed and deployed will outlast the length of the pandemic. This prominently features fears of mass surveillance which hallows out democratic systems with incredible effectiveness. At the same time technology based solutions, in a digital society provide for incredible facility in effectively tracing the path of infection of the Covid virus. One such solution which is being offered as being a compromise on privacy for the greater, common good is the Aarogya Setu App by the Government of India.

Recognising the digital nature of our society, we must press each available facility including technology to neuter the threat posed by Covid. This must be done in a rights respecting manner, and to make sure that such a realignment in policy priorities are made possible we have worked at pace to develop an exhaustive working paper that poses concerns and offers solutions on the path forward.

## Overview of the working paper

This [**working paper**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) is a comprehensive effort spanning 88 pages and 9 sections. The first two sections are devoted to the basic premises of public health requirements and the existing legal framework for the fundamental right to privacy. We have then in the next three sections looked extensively at the three primary methods how technology based interventions have impact on the fundamental right to privacy. Starting with the collection, use and dissemination of personal data which includes lists of people who have been placed in quarantine. Then going towards location based tracking and finally contact tracing. All three sections contain an analysis of influential literature and also some case studies to provide granular recommendations.

Following this we also analyse the incentives which need to be factored to increase user adoption of technology interventions, which we premise is based on growing trust. This can be achieved by respecting a person‚Äôs autonomy and has to be done in a manner which respects their rights. To illustrate how a contact tracing system can be built around these prescriptions, the paper builds out a front-end analysis of three contact applications Singapore‚Äôs TraceTogether, MIT‚Äôs Private Kit : Safe Path‚Äôs Project and Aarogya Setu (Pages 59-73) in Section 7. We also look at the Apple-Google partnership and the promise that it holds, but also indicate the unique risks which emerge from trans-national, silicon valley companies deploying such solutions which requires a heightened level of scrutiny.

Finally, we end with an appeal to policymakers stating, ‚Äú.Adapting a silicon valley adage, if we move fast, we may just break more than things -- possibly, even democracy itself. It is hoped that this working paper provides policy makers in India with an opportunity to pause, reflect and consider that constitutional imperatives of personal privacy must steer technology based responses to the Covid-19 pandemic.‚Äù

## We have three primary objectives from this working paper

*A comprehensive map on Covid technology interventions:* Our first and preliminary interest has been towards consolidating the incredible amount of literature on the technology based interventions that grows everyday. This is to document, analyse and then later pose solutions. We have here aimed to learn from the practices and learnings from several foriegn jurisdictions that can aid thinking in India.

*Breaking the digital rights and technology development silos:* Today technology based interventions are being designed they are driven out of a desire to immediately address the health and safety of large populations. These are increasingly done by technologists and programmers who may require detailed literature on digital rights and the implications for democratic guarantees. We hope this paper which undertakes specific case study analysis helps assist design based thinking and provides for actionable guidance in a manner which protects people holistically by safeguarding their health and privacy.

*Collaborative solutions for government:* We don't have all the answers. But, maybe if we work together, some credible suggestions can be made to the government. Covid has brought a sense of urgency to collaboration and we hope to take your suggestions through this week and then submit this working paper to Government authorities. To facilitate ease of comment we are hosting it on [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nDoPzygQyTetEguOlzula5O9y5f3f5YJDsA2Pd99O6U/edit?usp=sharing) with the functionality for comment and review. In addition to this please do engage with the wider community over at the [**Internet Freedom Forum**](https://forum.internetfreedom.in/).

## What does IFF plan to do with this working paper?

We will first work through this week with a series of explainers on our website to break it down into smaller, digestible pieces. So for instance by day after we plan to publish our case study comparison of contact tracing apps. This will be followed up by a further explainer on action based solutions to aid and assist policy makers. Based on feedback we receive through the week will also reach out to government, technologists, academics and experts.

This working paper is only one of the many public advocacy strategies in our tool kit to protect your privacy and fight against mass surveillance. For instance we have already filed RTIs to improve transparency in the development of such technology based interventions. More action will be taken as we continue to advocate for the protection of personal privacy along with public health.

1622,"101 years of Jallianwala Bagh massacre | Background | Aftermath | Shaheed Uddham Singh [Mega Thread]***\*Picture thread attached at the bottom, please read before you check it, I've tried to keep it as short yet detailed as possible\****

The **Jallianwala Bagh massacre**, also known as the **Amritsar massacre**, took place on 13 April 1919, when Acting Brigadier-General Reginald Dyer ordered troops of the British Indian Army to fire their rifles into a crowd of unarmed Indian civilians in Jallianwala Bagh, Amritsar, Punjab, killing at least 400 people including men and women. Over 1,000 people were injured.

Some facts about the Jallianwala Bagh massacre:

1. The precursor to the Massacre was the Rowlatt Act. This act was passed in February 1919.
2. The Rowlatt Act gave the British Government the authority to arrest anyone on grounds of mere suspicion.
3. The Rowlatt Act was basically designed for controlling activities of Indian Revolutionaries.
4. Protesting against the act, the Indians observed a hartal on March 30th and April 6th of 1919.
5. On April 10, 1919, two famous leaders, Dr. Kitchlew and Dr. Satyapal were arrested on the basis of the Rowlatt Act.
6. Two days later on the 12th of April, 1919, General Dyer took command of troops. He issued a proclamation banning all public gatherings
7. Though the proclamation was issued, no efforts were made to ensure that the general public came to know about it.
8. The gathering had no political intent at all. It was meant for celebrating Baisakhi ‚Äì the Sikh festival.
9. Anywhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people gathered at Jallianwala Bagh on the evening of that day.
10. The gathering included even children and women since it was all about celebrating Baisakhi.
11. Though the festival was a Sikh festival, many Hindus and Muslims also came to celebrate the same. All of them were there for commemorating the day when Khalsa Panth was founded by Guru Gobind Singh.
12. Apart from the main entrance, there was no way for the crowd to escape the garden as the area was surrounded by buildings. This is a major reason for the high number of casualties.
13. Apart from Gurkha and  Baluchi soldiers using Scinde rifles, there were also two armored cars with machine guns that were used in the shooting.
14. According to records, the people gathered were not warned or asked to disperse before Colonel Dyer ordered the firing.
15. The firings stopped only when the soldiers ran out of ammunition.
16. The shooting was followed by the proclamation of [martial law](https://www.britannica.com/topic/martial-law) in the Punjab that included public floggings and other humiliations
17. Indian outrage grew as news of the shooting and subsequent British actions spread throughout the subcontinent. The Bengali poet and Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore renounced the knighthood that he had received in 1915.
18. Gandhi was initially hesitant to act, but he soon began organizing his first large-scale and sustained nonviolent protest ([*satyagraha*](https://www.britannica.com/topic/satyagraha-philosophy)) campaign, the [noncooperation movement](https://www.britannica.com/event/noncooperation-movement) (1920‚Äì22), which thrust him to prominence in the Indian nationalist struggle.
19. Dyer was initially lauded for his actions in Britain and became a hero among many who were directly benefiting from the [British Raj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj) such as members of the [House of Lords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Lords). He was, however, widely criticised in the [House of Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Commons), whose July 1920 committee of investigation censured him.
20. The government of India ordered an investigation of the incident (the Hunter Commission), which in 1920 [censured](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/censured) Dyer for his actions and ordered him to resign from the military.
21. The last known survivor of the Jallianwala Bagh Massacre, Shingara Singh, died in Amritsar on June 29, 2009, at the age of 113.
22. The British Government tried to suppress information of the massacre, but news spread in India and widespread outrage ensued; details of the massacre did not become known in Britain until December 1919.
23. This event caused many moderate Indians to abandon their loyalty to the  British and become nationalists distrustful of the British
24. Colonel Dyer reported to his superiors that he had been ""confronted by a  revolutionary army"", to which Major General William Beynon replied:  ""Your action correct and Lieutenant Governor approves
25. Both [Secretary of State for War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_for_War) [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill) and former Prime Minister [H. H. Asquith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._H._Asquith),  however, openly condemned the attack, Churchill referring to it as  ""unutterably monstrous"", while Asquith called it ""one of the worst, most dreadful, outrages in the whole of our history"".
26. Winston Churchill, in the House of Commons debate of 8 July 1920, said,  ""The crowd was unarmed, except with bludgeons. It was not attacking anybody or anything‚Ä¶ When the fire had been opened upon it to disperse it,  it tried to run away. Pinned up in a narrow place considerably smaller than Trafalgar Square, with hardly any exits, and packed together so that one bullet would drive through three or four bodies, the people ran madly this way and the other. When the fire was directed upon the centre, they ran to the sides. The fire was then directed to the sides.  Many threw themselves down on the ground, the fire was then directed down on the ground. This was continued to 8 to 10 minutes, and it  stopped only when the ammunition had reached the point of exhaustion.""
27. After Churchill's speech in the House of Commons debate, MPs voted 247 to 37 against Dyer and in support of the Government.
28. The General Dyer-led massacre at Amritsar‚Äôs Jalianwalla Bagh, in 1919,  left an indelible dent on the psyche of millions of Indians.
29. Colonel Michael O'Dwyer was shot dead on 13 March, 1940, by a man named Udham Singh, a member of the revolutionist Ghadar party who was on a mission of revenge for the  Jallianwala Bagh Massacre.
30. The casualty number estimated by the Indian National Congress was more than 1,500 injured, with approximately 1,000 dead.
31. Indian nationalist [Swami Shraddhanand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swami_Shraddhanand) wrote to Gandhi of 1500 deaths in the incident.

# Shaheed Uddham Singh

1. **Shaheed Udham Singh** (26 December 1899 ‚Äì 31 July 1940), was a  revolutionary belonging to the Ghadar Party best known for his  assassination in London of Michael O'Dwyer, the former lieutenant governor of Punjab in India, on 13 March 1940
2.  While in custody, he used the name **Ram Mohammad Singh Azad**, which represents the three major religions of Punjab and his anti-colonial sentiment 
3. Shaheed Uddham Singh waited 21 years for revenge by killing the man he held responsible for the atrocity: the then lieutenant governor of Punjab Province, General  Michael O'Dyer.
4. While awaiting his trial, Singh went on a 42-day hunger strike and was force-fed. On 4 June 1940
5. When asked about his motivation, Singh explained:

>I did it because I had a grudge against him. He deserved  it. He was the real culprit. He wanted to crush the spirit of my  people, so I have crushed him. For full 21 years, I have been trying to  seek vengeance. I am happy that I have done the job. I am not scared of  death. I am dying for my country.  I have seen my people starving in  India under the British rule. I have protested against this, it was my  duty. What greater honour could be bestowed on me than death for the  sake of my motherland?

Singh was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. On 31 July 1940, Singh was hanged at [Pentonville Prison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentonville_Prison).

# Following his conviction, he made a speech

which the judge directed should not be released to the press.\[9\] However, political activists who had set up the Shaheed Udham Singh Trust and working with the Indian Workers Association (GB), ran a campaign to have the court record of his statement published along with other material

He started the speech with a denunciation of British Imperialism:

>""I say down with British Imperialism. You say India do not have peace. We have only slavery Generations of so-called civilization has brought us everything filthy and degenerating. known to the human race.  All you have to do is read your own history. If you have any human decency about you, you should die with shame. The brutality and bloodthirsty way in which the so-called intellectuals who call themselves  rulers of civilization in the world are bastard blood . . .""  
>  
>At this point, he was interrupted by the judge, but after some discussion, he continued:  
>  
>""I do not care about the sentence of death. It means nothing at all.  I do not care about dying or anything. I do not worry about it at all. I  am dying for a purpose.‚Äô Thumping the rail of the dock, he exclaimed,  ‚ÄòWe are suffering from the British Empire.‚Äô Udham Singh continued more quietly. ‚ÄòI am not afraid to die. I am proud to die, to have to free my native land and I hope that when I am gone, I hope that in my place will come thousands of my countrymen to drive you dirty dogs out; to free my country.  
>  
>""I am standing before an English jury. I am in an English court.  You people go to India and when you come back you are given a prize and put in the House of Commons. We come to England and we are sentenced to  death.‚Äô  
>  
>""I never meant anything, but I will take it. I do not care anything about it, but when you dirty dogs come to India there comes a  time when you will be cleaned out of India. All your British Imperialism  will be smashed.‚Äô ""Machine guns on the streets of India mow down thousands of poor  women and children wherever your so-called flag of democracy and  Christianity flies.‚Äô  
>  
>""Your conduct, your conduct ‚Äì I am talking about the British government. I have nothing against the English people at all. I have more English friends living in England than I have in India. I have great sympathy with the workers of England. I am against the Imperialist  Government.‚Äô  
>  
>""You people are suffering ‚Äì workers. Everyone are suffering through these dirty dogs; these mad beasts. India is only slavery.  Killing, mutilating and destroying ‚Äì British Imperialism. People do not read about it in the papers. We know what is going on in India.""  
>  
>At this point, the judge refused to hear any more, but Singh continued:  
>  
>""You ask me what I have to say. I am saying it. Because you people are dirty. You do not want to hear from us what you are doing in  India.  
>  
>He then thrust his glasses back into his pocket, and exclaimed three words in Hindustani and then shouted:  
>  
>'Down with British Imperialism! Down with British dirty dogs!""  
>  
>He turned to leave the dock, spitting across the solicitor‚Äôs table.

The best discussions are when multiple functional topics revolve around one abstract topic instead of only focusing on one facet. An understanding of the abstract is woefully incomplete when only viewed through one lens.   

To get meta for a second, this is also how we should be organizing our societies with multiple functional concepts (health, mobility, commerce, government, etc) organized around one abstract concept (an individual) instead of each facet of an individual being siloed. An understanding of an individual is also woefully incomplete when viewed through only one lens.

4. The female hostages would demand a separate accommodation.

5. Don't even think of the hostages changing to jumpsuits scene to be so smooth, everyone would demand a privacy üòÅ

6. Everyone, even after the 11th day would still have the perfect hair, makeup and those who have torn suits would have it in the right places to show off THEIR perfect biceps, abs  chest etc üòÉ

11. And all this Smoking /Drinking and Abuse against women disclaimers.

12. After the success of Season 2. The role of Professor would be played by Salman Khan or Aamir Khan and Katrina Kaif or Sonakshi would replace Tokyo/Nairobi in the subsequent seasons.

Please note I'm only looking at the big picture. I'm not trying to minimize the suffering of lakhs, just want to get an overall view of DeMo and its effects on the economy, black money and the tax base.

**The Good:**

* Under the new Amnesty scheme,  ‚Çπ4900 crores of unaccounted income was declared by around 21000 people. (Source - [Rs 4,900 crore black money disclosed under PMGKY, Rs 2,451 crore tax collected from it)](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/black-money-rs-4900-crore-disclosed-under-pmgky-rs-2451-crore-tax-collected-income-tax/story/259891.html)
* Over 2 lakh shell companies (corporations that exists only on paper and are often linked to money laundering and movement of black money) were struck off by the government, rendering them illegal. (Source - [India Cancels 2.24 Lakh Suspected Shell Companies Post Demonetisation](https://www.bloombergquint.com/law-and-policy/india-cancels-224-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation))
* In similar but separate action, around 3.09 lakh board of directors were disqualified for their companies failing to file financial statements and/or annual reports for a continuous period of three financial years. (Source - [Govt cancelled 2.24 lakh suspected shell companies post demonetisation, disqualified 3.09 lakh directors](https://www.firstpost.com/business/govt-cancelled-2-24-lakh-suspected-shell-companies-post-demonetisation-disqualified-3-09-lakh-directors-4194085.html))
* 48 per cent increase in deposits in Pradhan Mantri Jan-Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) accounts, with addition of 18 million accounts post-demonetisation (November 9 to January 25, 2017). The latest data indicate that 38.2 million new accounts were opened until July 26, 2017 since demonetisation. (Source - [Demonetisation and Bank Deposit Growth](https://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/MSM_Demonetisation.aspx))
* India witnessed a great jump in the account ownership during 2014-2017 as 80 percent Indians owned a bank account in 2017; there were only 35 percent bank account holders in 2011. Please note this is in(significant) part due to the PMJDY accounts. (Source - [55 percent of all new bank accounts in the world opened from India: Global Findex Report 2017](https://www.jagranjosh.com/current-affairs/19-crore-indian-adults-do-not-have-bank-accounts-global-findex-report-2017-1524203973-1))
* Several measures taken to improve transparency in the gold market, including GST have seen a shift from off-book transactions to accounted transactions (Source - [Demonetisation, GST impact: India is fast ceding gold market share to China](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-gst-impact-india-is-fast-ceding-gold-market-share-to-china-118050300388_1.html))
* Much more transparency in the real estate segment which is rife with black money dealings. DeMo paved the way for new acts such as the RERA which further increase transparency. The immediate drop in the prices in real estate (\~30%) can be attributed to black money not playing such a big part anymore (Source - [Demonetisation impact: Real estate sector still recovering from the jolt](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/real-estate/demonetisation-impact-real-estate-sector-still-recovering-from-the-jolt-2432723.html)). The real estate segment seems to recovering from the jolt, but now with much higher accountability. (Source -  [Impact of demonetisation on real estate recedes](https://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/impact-of-demonetisation-on-real-estate-recedes-117061400058_1.html))
* Direct Tax collection has increased siginificantly due to DeMo. Corporate income tax grew at 14% and Personal income tax grew at 13%. Net collections increased by 17.1% in FY18 and 14.6% in FY17, despite income tax rates staying mostly the same in the last couple of years. Since the note ban, direct tax buoyancy doubled from 0.6 times in FY16 to 1.3 times in FY17 and accelerated further to 1.7 times in FY18.

**The Bad:**

* Labourers in the textile, footwear, plastic and metal industry have been adversely affected by the demonetisation move.Labourers in the organised and unorganised sectors bore the biggest brunt of this move. In the time since the note-ban, over 50 lakh men have lost their jobs. The unemplyment rate hit a 45-year high of 6.1 percent in 2018. (Source - [50 lakh people lost jobs since demonetisation, says Azim Premji University report](https://www.businesstoday.in/sectors/jobs/50-lakh-people-lost-jobs-since-demonetisation-says-azim-premji-university-report/story/337980.html))
* In the immediate aftermath of DeMo, MSME's were the most badly affected. Small businesses with no access to PoS machines suffered during the immediate aftermath. This inadvertently led to the bigger players overpowering the market. (Source - [Demonetisation: Indian SMEs suffered a blow, still struggling to find their footing](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/demonitisation-indian-smes-suffered-a-blow-still-struggling-to-find-their-footing/articleshow/61541952.cms?from=mdr))
* The manufacturing segment was hit pretty hard. The Nikkei India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index (PMI) fell to 49.6, indicating a contraction. Cash flow issues battered the entire sector, leading to lower employment, reduction in production activity and rise in input costs. The Index of Industrial Production (IIP) saw just a 4.9% growth in November, compared to 6.6 percent in October. (Source - [Demonetisation hits manufacturing sector](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/Demonetisation-hits-manufacturing-sector/article16979062.ece))
* Agriculture was one of the worst hit sectors. The Ministry of Agriculture acknowledged that due to the lack of cash, millions of farmers were unable to purchase seeds and fertilisers ahead of the rabi season. Due to the shortage of cash, about 1.38 lakh quintals of wheat seeds of the national seed corporation were not even sold. Sale, transport, marketing and distribution of ready produce to wholesale centres or mandis, is dominantly cash-dependent. Disruptions, breaks in the supply chains feedback to farmers as sales fall, increased wastage of perishables, lower revenues that show up as trade dues instead of cash in hand and when credited into bank accounts with limited access affect the sector. Incomes and profit margins were hit hard. (Source - [Demonetization: The impact on agriculture](https://www.livemint.com/Opinion/B1vFTOgwqHjdM5nkmg2CxJ/Demonetization-The-impact-on-agriculture.html))
* The rural and informal economy suffered disproportionately as most of the transactions are cash-based. The pile up at wholesale markets lead to a sharp decline in the Wholesale price index (WPI) of perishables in the immediate aftermath of DeMo. (Source - [How demonetisation affected the Indian economy, in 10 charts](https://www.livemint.com/Politics/ySbMKTIC4MINsz1btccBJO/How-demonetisation-affected-the-Indian-economy-in-10-charts.html))
* A systemic liquidity crunch was created due to the note ban leading to massive disruption in the supply and demand of several goods. The performance of the equity markets saw a sharp reversal, but recovered quickly enough. (Source - [INDIAN DEMONETIZATION AND THE LIQUIDITY CONUNDRUM](https://insight.factset.com/indian-demonetization-and-the-liquidity-conundrum))
* Economic growth slowed to 6.1 percent, a loss of 2-3 percent. Please note we were already on the cusp of an economic slowdown and the subsequent measures such as DeMo and GST further aggravated the issue. (Source - [Demonetisation hit growth by 2 percentage points: US Study](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/demonetisation-hit-growth-by-2-percentage-points-us-study/articleshow/67154320.cms))

**The Ugly:**

* The excercise led to the death of several people, and caused immeasurable distress to a significant percentage of the population. I don't feel the need to go into detail as this is not the point of this post.

A couple more points I'd like to add:

* Just because **99.3%** of the cash in circulation prior to DeMo has returned to the system doesn't mean that the excercise was a complete failure. The issue of black money was tackled on several fronts. I believe the main point of DeMo was never to take out a significant chunk of currency out of rotation (despite what the government says). I believe the government got everyone on the black-money bandwagon as a way to make people feel that they personally were helping in the fight against black money. Again, just my theory.
* I believe the true purpose of DeMo was to bring **more transparency and accountability** to the economic system, in addition to making more and more of India **tax compliant and a part of the formal economy.** I do believe that the informal sector plays a very important role, particularly in the times of economic crisis, but that's a story for another day.

Summing up, I'd like to point out that DeMo can neither be categorized as a success or a failure. It has its place, in the grey, neither black nor white as some people believe. That's the point of my post. Thanks for reading.Please let me know if I missed anything and I'd be happy to update my post.",1586675351.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,9,13

But why do most of us choose to work at jobs instead of taking risks by doing something else like a start-up or taking jobs with high risk? I am not saying that working at a 9-5 job is bad, but atleast some good percentage of us should have been risk takers, right?

In my opinion the reason why Americans are more successful is because they take huge risks and they either payoff or they fail and they go in debt. We should be able to take risks because even if they fail most of our parents are happy to bail us out compared to the western parents. 

Please note that I am not judging anyone who works at a no risk job. I was just wondering why as a country we all do this. I also understand that the risk taking culture has improved in the past few years.

Woh Safdar Hashmi ki den hai. He was born today.

Safdar Hashmi was an activist and street theatre artist. and later identified with the communist ideology as well.

He was a turning point for street play and street theatre in India. His work highlighting human rights and grassroots changes irked many in the establishment. He openly mocked Indira Gandhi's grab of power of the Emergency, to government actions, government apathy, the plight of the poor and uneducated in India.

He was killed while performing a street play after he was attacked by the goons of the Congress party.

In later years the government, played this very song as a public campaign on Doordarshan.

Safdar was not killed due to his ideology. He was killed because he raised his voice, he mocked the establishment. He inspired people to be aware of their rights, to question.

This is the story the world over. This is today as well. TOday's deaths get whitewashed by a pliant media, that does not mean fundamental issues don't exist today. Or that we have benevolent Gods in power in the government.

Narendra Dabholkar, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare , Gauri Lankesh are grim reminders today.

I am not here to rant and rave but to show the true face of the corporate greed which clearly indicates that there's something wrong with all of this.   


To begin with, I am an entrepreneur and freelancer, having a line of credit that too with a limit of just 10,000 INR is not all that bad. However, when COVID-19 struck, I lost my clients and the due receivables from my prior clients were also stuck up. Quite reasonably, I would need to worry about my survival in a city like Mumbai and thus had whatever little I saved up in my accounts cashed due to obvious fear of not being able to pay for basic commodities. However, Slicepay through its clever legal loopholes and fuelled by its corporate hunger would not consider even a moratorium. Constant threats and random people claiming to be ""recovery agents"" have called and texted me. Even after a telephonic call with their actual staff who said I can pay it later with higher interest which I agreed to, even after that I have been completely harassed on a regular basis. 

So what is the takeaway? Well, for starters if you were thinking about this service think again. I am not an isolated example, thankfully I am a law student and caught their BS when they called my friend who also defaulted for the same reasons and said that they're in police station and are filing FIR.

This is my first post on reddit, although i have been following reddit for past 2 years. 

Countries like Czech republic and Taiwan have kept spread of virus under control by ensuring everyone wears it. This was a totally new thing for Czech Republic but as a nation they have responded amazingly. 

Me and my friends think, we will eventually have to do this in India, even after lockdown is removed. Also mass production and distribution of masks to all with take time. 

 We all have time and can contribute to this by all making a DIY mask. There are studies which clearly say that it reduces the growth rate of masks. 

We have started a #masks4allChallenge on FB and Twitter along the lines of Ice bucket Challenge which has following steps

\- Make a DIY mask  
\- Share with someone in your surrounding  
\- Tag 3 friends to take up the challenge and ask them to share in their timeline

And the thing is that post corona if we survive there are more problems ahead of us. I just thinking our country is coming near recession. As i would be passing out that scares me. And surely somebody's gonna respond to china in one way or another regarding the virus.

Level of Brainwashing is so high that these idiots have been made to believe that Muslims have spread this virus.

Indian msm and online it cell have turned Indian Muslims  into a punching bag for these silly frustrated people "" tired of not becoming a Superpower already well beat the pinata of Muslims"". 

Not surprised to see that people didn't question the narrative of media at all which blames Muslims even after the country has one of the lowest Testing rates so we cannot know for sure the exact sources of the outbreak and exact number of the infected but f it lets beat the pinata. 

Muslim vendors were beaten on the streets & people are being asked not to buy anything from the shops of Muslims. This madness is not surprising anymore to us.

 We are living in the times where crticizing modi and his goons isn't allowed. Media has become the mouthpiece of the government and support for Modi is equated with patriotism.

I posted this in r/Indian_Academia but didn't get any responses. Posting here for better visibility. 

Sorry for a long post but I would really appreciate some career guidance.

I'm gonna give you a brief background of my situation. I graduated in 2016 with a BSc in Statistics, Mathematics and Economics (from Christ University Bangalore if it matters). During second year of college I really got into skateboarding and was desperately trying to make it work as a career option. I worked with Holystoked collective (they are the pioneers of skateboarding scene in India), built a skatepark in Bangalore with them and life was amazing. But towards the end of my undergrad I injured my knee pretty bad and things went downhill from there. One injury led to another and before I could realize, I had a knee issue, back pain, hip pain and what not. I was in poor health and it eventually took toll on my mental health. Long story short I pretty much wasted a little over one year. In 2017 I got my shit together and wrote the entrance test for writing actuarial exams. I started writing actuarial exams in 2018 and cleared 4 Core Technical exams by the end of 2019. I was going to write two more exams this April but our exams got cancelled due to COVID 19 pandemic.

Now, I've been looking for an actuarial job for some time now and realized that its really really hard to get a job without contacts or college placements. I have also been learning data sciece and machine learning with python, as I already have a solid maths and statistics foundation, so as to get a data science or data analyst job and then perhaps switch to actuarial eventually. But now with an almost inevitable economic recession looming over our heads, I'm a little worried about my career.

Could someone please guide me? Where do I go from here? Should I keep looking for jobs? Even if I do find a job I don't expect it to be more than 5LPA. Or should I go for higher education? Would an MBA in Finance or Business Analytics make sense?",1586678044.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,4,16

1925,"[serious] COVID-19, Help me here! where am i going wrong? (Please - I am not trying to create a panic.)too long but please read. please do not panic over this as i may be a dumbass.

The [Mortality rate of Covid-19 in India](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms)  is 3.05, according to this [article](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/indias-covid-19-death-rate-lower-than-many-developed-nations-like-us-uk-medical-experts/articleshow/75084199.cms).

The mortality rate in US is about 3.57, in Italy around 12 and in UK it's more than 12.(according to the above article)

so about 3 people die per 100 cases in India. It's scary! but not too much.

currently, mortality rate is calculated by number of death per number of cases .

    mortality rate = Total Death / Total cases

currently in world, **1,806,436** active cases and **111,722** deaths.(the curve is nowhere near flat)

mortality rate = 111722/1806436 = 6.18% worldwide.

so about 6 people die per 100 cases worldwide. It's scary! still not too much.

let's assume an [infection rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu) of 20% (20 percent of population would get infected in a span of [2 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif)). 25% is the infection rate for Spanish influenza and it didn't spread to many country as covid-19, the social distancing was not that great before and there were [three waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_flu#/media/File:1918_spanish_flu_waves.gif).

&#x200B;

now, 20% of 7.7 billion people is 1.4 billion (very huge) and 6% of 1.4 billion is 84 million(estimated death toll). 

realistically, if the infection rate is brought down to 1%(by social distancing, lock-down, etc) the death toll would still be 4.2 million. (stay the f\*ck inside home, seriously)

&#x200B;

now, my real panic is that the current mortality rate calculation takes total active cases into account( the people who got infected and are still in hospital waiting for outcome.) eventually these people will either die or get cured.

Doesn't it make sense that we should only consider the cases which had outcome for mortality rate calculation?

    mortality rate = total dead / (total discharged or cured+total dead)

In this case, 

current mortality rate = 111,722 / (413,222+111,722) = 21.3% (that's huge) (numbers from [worldometer](https://imgur.com/a/E2HZnAI))

this changes everything.

now, if the infection rate is 1%(more likely estimate) the death toll would be 16.4 million.(holy f\*uck)

which makes this one of the worst pandemics in history. 

In [India](https://imgur.com/a/vOkmjyH), 

mortality rate = 331/(1080+331) = 23.45% (which is very high, above world mean) (why are scientists saying we have low mortality rate?)

Did gov officials know about this?  or they know and they are keeping it silent to not cause any panic?

BTW, the actions taken by Indian gov is by far the best in the world.(as far as i researched) . they did bring down the infection rate by a huge factor.

&#x200B;

please help me with these questions:

* Am i doing the calculation correct or did i miss any variable? 
* Does India have huge asymptomatic cases, which were not reported?
* How did china contain this? did china actually contain this or lying about the numbers? 
* because the numbers in china are nowhere close to other countries. their mortality rate (by second method - only calculating outcomes) is 4% while for the rest of the world is 21%. it never crossed 5% at any time(very suspicious). Their mortality rate is low all the way? why all the country have similar curve except china? 
* why India is relying on Chinese model in containing this Virus?  **India should not follow Chinese model** to contain this problem.(i know medical students who are lazy to do their maths). 
* how is it possible for China to contain this as the infection rate is very high .R0 = 2.2 for covid-19, based on Chinese study  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - 34,200 in 2018/19 (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).[chinese study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/) ,  for comparison seasonal flu in USA, has an R0 of 1.3 and roughly kills about 25,000 to 75,000 - [34,200 in 2018/19](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/burden/2018-2019.html) (remember that this is the rate for an exponential graph).
* how can we model this in India? will India be f\*ucked if there were a community spread?

Can we get some volunteers who can send me materials on how to model this properly? I know data science, i can make a website. with your help i can make some valuable prediction on how this will unfold and will give you that information for free.

**Detailed Installing Instructions**: [Documentation](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier#installation)

This program gives you a system notification (cross-platform: Windows, Linux, OS X) whenever a delivery slot is found available in your current delivering address.


- Due to current pandemic crisis of Covid-19: A severe lockdown has been placed in India such that people look towards online services to get their groceries to them, BigBasket is one of the popular services providing all of the resources online. However, due to the excess demand, delivery slots get filled way too quickly for anyone to order items for their given address.



Some of the key features includes:

1. Cross platform system wide notifications.
1. You can login via OTP all by the terminal itself.
1. Ability to save your sessions allowing you to login only once.
1. Logging enabled by default for better debugging.
1. Configuration flexibility regarding various options.
1. Program doesn't do any javascript-rendering via headless browsers or anything.
1. Polling is done via API endpoints rather than relying on scraping improving stability.


Due to the current pandemic crisis of Covid-19, I advise to only order items that are necessary for your household chores instead of hoarding supplies that aren't needed per se.

I have made the documentation regarding the program as clear as possible such that anyone can install and start using it in their systems, However if you have any ideas to improve the section - Feel free to send a PR.

The program is completely *open source*, such that you can audit it yourself if you have any security concerns related to the matter at: [Github](https://github.com/wrap-away/bigbasket-notifier)

But one of my closest friends is stuck in Delhi (Kalkaji, South Delhi). He was returning from Ranchi to his home in Noida after giving an interview there. Unfortunately, when he returned to Delhi, the same day, all cabs/metro/buses stopped working due to strict lockdown measures. And UP border as well as Delhi was sealed. Consequently, he could not reach Noida and had to settle for getting a PG room somehow but was still living in scarcity of food etc .He tried asking for police help from both Delhi and UP police, but no help. Now, the accommodation manager has increased per day rent to around  Rs. 1200/night. And with coming summer and further scarcity of food, etc., it is becoming increasingly tough for him to manage. All his savings are nearly finished. I tried to help whatever little I could financially. And hoped that lockdown would end on April 14 and he might move back to his home. But now with lockdown further extended, chances of his survival are getting really slim. Plus, there looks no definite end to lockdown to be hopeful.

I will be extremely indebted if any of you might help at the moment. If someone has a room available in a house and can keep him for a few days, that would be seriously life saver. He can still pay something for the room, but hopefully he will get to use the kitchen or something, so that at least he gets meals once a day. 

As I said, I know it's super awkward to ask for this kind of help at the moment and probably we won't get any. But I am trying with all my luck if some miraculous solution emerge. If it helps, he was already screened for Covid at Delhi airport and was tested negative. Also, he has been mostly living alone for the past few weeks and do not have any symptoms.

1986,"Explainer: The proposed ‚Äúzones‚Äù idea and why it is a disastrous one.The government is apparently floating the idea to create zones of three kinds, red, orange and green. Red zones are hotspots with 15 or more cases, and there will be no activity in them. Orange zones have less than 15 cases and they will have limited public activity, like limited public transport. Green zones have no virus cases where restrictions will be relaxed. (They‚Äôve not yet come out with a full list of relaxed restrictions in this)

My problem is a very obvious one: We are NOT testing enough. Because of this, we don‚Äôt actually have a conception of which zones are red, orange or green. That means because of the virus‚Äô 2-week incubation period and the fact that it is asymptomatic means that there will be people roaming around without realising they are infected, causing green zones to also eventually turn orange or red.

https://np.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/fl0pdv/mark_cuban_says_bailed_out_companies_should_never/

The execs of the top US companies who have tonnes of money as it is , I'm not sure exactly, but messed up. Didn't save any money, kept reinvesting profits in their own stocks so that company value goes up and now are basically going through heavy losses and have put the jobs of citizens at risk plus they want the government to use taxpayer money to bail them out.

And from what I gather these companies will remain privatised and won't be nationalised.

There is an uproar within the US against this and a comment I really liked stated ""Why should the profits be privatised and losses be socialised"" 

Anyway, I want to know what the policies are like in India. If India has similar policies and private companies in India will go through the same thing?

What are the policies Indian government in similar situations? Is buying your own stock also legal in India? 

If someone could also explain the situation in US and in similar context the Indian economy and situation. That will be greatly appreciated.

Any additional insight and points are also welcome.",1586620793.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,0,8

Context:

The Prime Minister, while announcing the lockdown had to decide between saving lives and ensuring livelihoods. He rightly privileged the former over the latter then. As India nears the end of the lockdown period, the serious damage to the economy and livelihoods is beginning to make itself apparent. The editorial talks about various measures to manage the unprecedented crisis on the economic front.  

Issues:

There is tremendous pressure from industry bodies to opt for a nuanced policy that will help economic activity to restart.
They fear a collapse if activity is stopped for another fortnight.
Lives could be lost to hunger and livelihoods sacrificed in the lockdown.
Way ahead:

One way to sidestep this existential dilemma is by bringing on a second round of an economic relief package that goes well beyond the first both in terms of the financial commitment and the spread. 
The ‚Çπ1.7-lakh crore package announced by Finance Minister was a good start but barely accounted for 1% of GDP. India should spend at least 5% of GDP for now ‚Äî about ‚Çπ10-lakh crore. 
The cash transfers to the poor should be hiked to at least ‚Çπ3,000 a month for the next three months. This should be in addition to free rations and cooking gas, as was announced earlier.
Out-of-the-box ideas for delivering support and also for raising the required funds might be required. 
The government should let go off fiscal conservatism and go all out to spend and support the economy. Economists are unanimous that there is little option now but to print money and spend (what the developed countries are doing).
In the harvest season, farmers need logistical support for moving their produce to markets.
Lenders, including NBFCs, should be granted freedom to reschedule their loan accounts so that borrowers are not under pressure to repay for fear of turning delinquent. 
A credit guarantee fund that will support non-delinquent borrowers for the next six months will be a good option. 
Such a fund can be financed through a domestic bond offering. 
The bankruptcy code should be suspended for the next six months, at least for MSMEs. 
A GST holiday for the next three months would be a good option.
The loss of revenue will be ‚Çπ3-lakh crore at worst, but in reality will be much lower than that because economic activity is at a standstill now. 
Such a move will ease cash flows for business and also obviate the need for statutory compliances at a time when the focus will have to be on getting businesses back on track. 


Conclusion:

The crisis now is without precedent and the solutions must not be conservative. Generous support from the government, and quickly delivered, is the need of the hour.",1586633110.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,1,8

2184,"A Gist of Indian Innovation To Combat COVID-19The contagious COVID-19 outbreak has caused a catastrophic effect around the world. Countries are struggling to control and contain the spread of this disease. India, with its massive population, is making the best efforts to fight against the COVID-19 virus. The 21 day lockdown period has not locked down the creative minds of the researchers and engineers of our country. India supports all forms of innovations in the diagnosis, [treatment](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/), prevention, and spread of COVID-19.

We keep hearing many heart-touching stories of researchers and doctors working to combat this dreadful disease. Here is a gist of what the innovation community of India is up to and how our Government supports them.

##### Innovations across the Country

###### Triple-Layered Anti-infectious Gloves¬†

About 8.3% of the total cases in Italy are health workers who treat and take care of infected people. A team of Indian youngsters from Viral Brain System have realized the seriousness of this issue and have designed triple-layered gloves that are anti-infectious. The gloves not only protect the user‚Äôs hands but also disinfect everything the personal touches while wearing the gloves. These gloves, once opened, can be used for a maximum period of three days. The inner and outer layers of the gloves are made of latex, while the middle layer contains the sanitizer or any disinfecting chemical. The prototype is in testing and can be expected in the market soon.

###### Anti-bacterial Clothing

[Thermaissance](https://thermaissance.com/), a startup from the GTU-incubation center, has come up with specially designed anti-bacterial clothing for hospital staff. The innovation makes use of nano silver-based technology that is capable of destroying both positive and harmful bacteria. This reduces the risk of exposure and spread of diseases among hospital staffs that are in close contact with the COVID-19 infected people. They have also come up with cheap, anti-bacterial masks tested in a NABL accredited laboratory in Mumbai for their authenticity. The masks offer 99% protection from germs even after 60 washes.

###### Colour-changing Mask

A three-layered color-changing mask to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus is at the concept stage of innovation by the [Babaria Institute of Pharmacy](https://bitspharmacy.org/). The mask prevents the entry of Coronavirus and also acts as an indicator when exposed to the virus. The membranous layers of the mask consist of enzymes and chemical reagents that can copy DNA to RNA. When the mask comes in contact with Coronavirus particles, the mask constituents react with the virus and form a solid pink color. The change in color will indicate exposure to the virus.

###### 3-D Printed Toothbrush

The innovation from the startup, Pragratham, addresses the importance of oral hygiene in the survival rate of corona virus-infected persons. This toothbrush is specially designed for COVID-19 patients in ICU. This open-source design requires a 3-D printer and cotton gauze to construct the toothbrush. It takes an hour and 45 minutes to produce a single 3-D printed toothbrush. The product has received positive feedback when tested.

###### The Quarantine Watch App

The senior IAS officer Munish Moudgil with his team in Karnataka has launched India‚Äôs first unique mobile app to facilitate active tracking of people in quarantine. The application works on both android and iPhone platforms. The home-quarantined person should download the app, fill in essential personal details, and send selfies. The system will identify good resolution selfies, and officials from the District Photo Verification team will check for the originality of the selfie. The application has also enabled GPS tracking to trace their whereabouts effectively.

###### Online Training Programme

The Karnataka Government has launched a 1.30-2.00 hour training programme to train doctors treating COVID-19 patients. The programme is freely accessible on YouTube. The programme helps doctors to prepare themselves and also teach them on specimen collection and transport, clinical management, and supportive therapy for COVID-19 patients.

###### Sanitization Units

PadCare Labs, a Pune-based startup, has designed a sanitization unit to disinfect the surface area. The unit working on the principle of UV mechanism can disinfect an area of 80 sq ft with a 99.99% bacterial reduction in 15 minutes. The organization will be installing the units in a local hospital soon.

###### C-CAMPs Initiatives

The Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms ([C-CAMP](http://www.ccamp.res.in/)) has launched COVID-19 Innovations Deployment Accelerator (CIDA) to identify and support innovations that help in combating Coronavirus. The program has partnered with Social Alpha, United Nations Health Innovation Exchange (UNHIE), India2022 Xynteo, India Health Fund, MedTechConnect, AIC-CCMB, and CCMB to select innovations and develop them to large scale applications. The companies with projects towards the following criteria were nominated for funding.

###### Preventative Measures

[Anabio](https://www.anabio.ie/) Technologies Pvt Ltd works on innovating new preventative technologies that offer better protection than the existing ones. The technology from this company aims to transform a mask or a regular cotton cloth into a protective agent against Coronavirus. This technology will work on meeting the needs of N95 masks and other personal protective equipment.

###### Diagnostics

There is a rising need in India to perform mass-testing to identify and isolate people infected with COVID-19. CoSara Diagnostics Pvt Ltd and Ampligene Diagnostics Pvt Ltd are working on developing easy-to-use, affordable, quick, and accurate diagnostic technologies.

###### Respiratory Devices

5-10% of the Indian population will require ICU in the event of community spread in India. There is a rising need for invasive and non-invasive respirators to treat critically ill patients. US FDA has approved the use of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machines (CPAP) to meet the scarcity of ventilators. Coeo Labs and Avyantra are working on innovations in the mass production of respirators to achieve this scenario.

Many such innovations are going around in the nook and corner of our country to fight back COVID-19. Our Government has also launched several incubation programmes to encourage innovators working on combating this dreadful disease. The active contribution from young [entrepreneurs](https://www.intepat.com/blog/intellectual-property/intellectual-property-rights/) and researchers is inevitable to serve our country during this massive health crisis.",1586639938.0,,Coronavirus,dark,2,9

2280,"It is time to end the national lockdown . There is absolutely no need to extend it any further .It is time to stop the national lockdown immediately. Instead of extending it further , the government should leave the decision to each state's government.

Each state government should have the right to take a call on whether they want to extend the lockdown or not .

Even if they want to extend the lockdown ,instead of shutting down the whole state , only seal the hotspot areas . 

Extending a national lockdown will be  disastrous for everyone . Supply chains are completely broken . Government machinery has come to a halt . Many essential industries have frozen . People are suffering.

People are literally starving in their homes right now . The government is doing nothing to help those whose daily wages have stopped due to the lockdown .

The public distribution system has failed as usual . People who live in villages can't go to banks to take relief money from their accounts due to the lockdown . Many Indians don't even have a ration card , so they are not eligible for the government ration food.

The seasonal migrants are locked out of their homes and hometown . They have to sleep on roads , without food or money and often harassed by policemen .

What is the national lockdown achieving ? How can someone say with a pokerface that people literally on the verge of starvation is acceptable?

I know economy can always be rebuilt. I am not saying this from the point of view of economy .

I am saying this from the point of view of people who suffering a lot during the lockdown .

2329,"India to extend lockdown by 2 weeksIndia is set to extend its nationwide lockdown for another two weeks, until April 30, as its confirmed coronavirus caseload continues to soar, with no sign that the severe restrictions on most economic activities have flattened the curve.  India confirmed its highest ever daily number of infections at 1,035 over the past 24 hours, health ministry officials said. This brings the total number of confirmed coronavirus patients to nearly 7,500. Of those, 642 have recovered, and 239 have died.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi engaged in a four-hour dialogue with chief ministers of Indian states on Saturday to discuss whether to lift the lockdown, which has caused extreme hardships to India‚Äôs hundreds of millions of casual and informal sector workers, whose incomes have collapsed since the restrictive measures were introduced on March 22.  Mr Modi made no official statement or comment after the meeting concluded. But Arvind Kejriwal, the chief minister of New Delhi, made it clear that the lockdown would not be lifted on April 14, when it is currently due to expire. Mr Modi is expected to address the nation on Sunday or Monday night about the extension.  Analysts and industries expect that Mr Modi may announce some relaxation of the restrictions for farmers, who are poised to harvest their annual winter wheat crop. Industrial businesses, especially exporters, are also hoping for some relaxation for manufacturers so they can maintain the supply of essential items, and fulfil international orders.  However, all India‚Äôs public transportation systems -- including urban metros rails, the railway network, and all domestic and international passenger flights -- are likely to remain suspended.

-------------------
>there are a lot of things that impact whether or not the test actually picks up the virus,"" Priya Sampathkumar, an infectious diseases specialist at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, told AFP.

It depends on how much virus the person is shedding (through sneezing, coughing, and other bodily functions), how the test was collected and whether it was done appropriately by someone used to collecting these swabs, and then how long it sat in transport,"" she said.

>With 40 million people, ""even if only one percent of the population was tested, 20,000 false-negative results would be expected."" (USA)

Part of the problem lies in locating the virus as its area of highest concentration shifts within the body.

Many households and companies find it difficult to cope with the current lockdown situation. As important as it is to get work turning out, it is more important to ensure the safety and well-being of all our employees. Fortunately, we at Lohono Stays have managed to tackle the challenge caused by this pandemic. Realising the density of the situation soon enough, we were able to proactively apply the work from home policy.

Applying the work from home policy well in time, helped us safeguard the interests of all our team members. However, this was not the smoothest ride. Considering our operations run in over 4 locations across India and South East Asia, we had to ensure that everybody was secure. We ensured that every staff member or villa member staying at our luxury holiday homes received the bare necessities to get through these quarantined times in perfect health. To enhance the productivity of all our team members, our CEO, Mr. Nibhrant Shah personally suggests good articles to read and encourages all to build on their skillset. Our team members are also encouraged to take up online courses, better yet we are setting up online MasterClasses for them. These will help all team members to learn and grow every day.

Our team is constantly working on improving the sanitation and comfort offered at our villas for rent in Goa, luxury villas in Lonavala, Coonoor villas for rent and private villas for rent in Alibaug. We want to be able to immediately get back into action as soon as things are up and running again. We at Lohono Stays, urge everyone to stay safe and stay at home. This battle can only be won by everyone staying indoors.

If crores of people install it, just using wireless heahphones is enough to track your location.

It picks up bluetooth signals that it comes in contact with. So even if the person standing next to you has this installed, and you don't have your bluetooth hidden, your location is noted and added to the social graph.

While I see how it will allow them to back days and see whom all an affected patient came in contact with, they also see who all you came in contact with, where you were at a point in time etc.

As per the procedure,now home ministry is one of the most important in current condition , but Amit shah who can confidently take press conferences unlike his guru is seen nowhere.

Was having a chat with a old friend who is a gujrat based journalist, he was saying that Modi dreams have got bigger and he is now aiming to become somewhat of a global icon and dreaming of a nobel prize like Obama , the reason we see him buttering international leaders like Trump and Jinping.Modi is also video conferencing other chief ministers and taking stock of this pandemic albeit in a very democratic manner.

Few months back, he has instructed party top brass to keep Hindu-Muslim politics aside as he will go for a image rebuilding in the coming years.
But Shah is Shah, his entire political career is based on communal politics, and he is quite dope on that and cannot survive if he doesn't do his regular drama. 

We can see the notorius UP police filing FIRs on news channels on false reporting of Tabliki jamaat attendees , it was an outcome of Modi giving a stern warning to party top brass to not give a communal twist to corona pandemic. 

Congress has a godfather culture ,where party leaders usually don't topple their godfather.
But BJP is quite opposite where there is a culture of outsmarting their gurus., be it Modi-advani, Gadkari-fadnavis, Shivraj-Vijayvargiya., Maybe Amit shah was also planning the same and was getting bigger for his shoes, hence his wings are getting clipped .",1586583787.0,#ea0027,Unverified - Opinion,light,73,97

2525,"(Story time) 13th Dec, 1971 - The day when Russian Nuclear warheads surfaced on the Bay of Bengal to stop USS Enterprise from attacking IndiaDuring the 1971 war between India and Pakistan for the liberation of Bangladesh (formerly known as East Pakistan), US and UK sided with Pakistan and sent their warships to India and US. 

On 13th December 1971, US President Nixon redirected the 7th Navy Fleet led by the 75,000 ton nuclear powered aircraft carrier USS Enterprise, the most powerful warship in the world at that time, to go to the Bay of Bengal to stop India from liberating Bangladesh

Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi promptly called on Moscow to invoke a secret provision in the India-Soviety treaty under which Russia was bound to defend India in case of any external aggression. Russia sent a nuclear armed flotilla including a Nuclear submarine from Vladivostok on 13th December, 1971 under the command of Admiral Vladimir Kuroyedov, who has orders not to allow the US Fleet to advance and attack the military bases of India. 

The only thing standing between the US Fleet and the Indian cities was the Indian Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant and the Russian fleet, so India and Russia came up with a crafty plan to stop them. 

As the US Aircraft carrier was entering the Bay of Bengal to attack India, for the first time in human history the Russians decided to intentionally bring their Nuclear submarine to the surface and let the Americans see them.

As soon as the Russian Submarine surfaced on the Bay of Bengal, the US Admiral lost all hope and made the following quote 'We are too late, the Russians are already here'
The mere fact of seeing Russian nuclear warheads in the Bay of Bengal changed America's mind and they retreated.

Russia further went on to say 'A war on India will be considered a war on Russia' and threatened China to not join the conflict on orders of the US and threatened to sink Sinkiang (a region in China) if they tried to stop India from liberating Bangladesh.

Ever since then India has considered Russia as their most trusted ally in the world and is now the largest importer of Russian weapons and Nuclear Reactors in the world.

That's the reason a Russian president has never set foot in Pakistan.",1586614387.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,192,783

2529,"Please, help maids and wage workersI see a lot of donation to govt. fund me for covid19 promotions. It's a great idea definitely. I have zero idea what and how they handle the donation money. How much goes to affected peoples and how much who works to collect it gets. But I say this here, there is no greater help than helping the affected directly in hand, with cold cash.

Facts why direct donation is the best:

* Instant result
* Credit goes to you, not authorities who collect the cash from you
* Lot of love from the receiver <3
* no fees, full money worth
* karma bonus points ;)
* helps keep starvation away
* more..

In this crisis times, 
they are the most affected, without work, money and lots of mouths to feed. Now most of them are penniless. This vast large number of people are isolated from our thinking bubble, living area, social bubble, social media. Where do they ask for help? Who hears their struggles! While they all just worked for our comfort, the mundane things we think we don't deserve to do! 

Our society just asked all residents to fire the maids, although i fired ours month ago with extra bonus obviously, she has two children's. I'm going to send her money again soon. I'm afraid how many lakh maid and wage worker families are starving right now. Again I have zero idea.

2530,"Overpopulation - how I would go about trying to fix itBy 2050, we are projected to add a further ~300mn more to our current 1.3bn to reach a total of 1.7bn. Quality of life issues are further exacerbated because of income/wealth inequality, as we're seeing played out in the Coivd-19 crisis. This problem is not limited to India alone, as all of South Asia has gone/is going through the same boom, putting further pressure on limited resources in the region. 

Political parties don't want to touch this issue, and for good reason - India has a dark past with population ""control"". The Indian state, further, cannot impose its will upon its citizenry as the Chinese state had in the past (one child policy). In any event, I personally believe people have an inalienable right to do what they want with their bodies, whether that means having 5 children or no children. 

In my view, what's required are policies that are geared towards rewarding those who don't have children, in addition to current policies encouraging contraception. Participation will be totally voluntary. The following can be awarded to people who undertake to remain childless:-

1. Government issues bonds that mature in 30/40/50 years. It could be called the Bonds Issued To Childless Hedonists (**BITCH**). At maturity, this bond will be worth what the market dictates will be required to retire at 65. Instead of a child maturing and taking care of its parents, the bond will. The corpus will be funded through borrowings raised on the basis of the savings the state is projected to make through decreased spending on public welfare services. 

2. Alternatively, government could also make a one time cash payment that would be further significantly less than the value of the proposed bond at maturity.

3. In lieu of cash payments/bond issues, government could award agricultural land to childless persons. The value of the land proposed to be awarded will have to be the same for all awardees.

4. Medals/certificates/government mandated public approval. I personally don't care for this, but most people do. In any event, Indian society across the board seems to view childless people with suspicion.

5. Encouraging adoption through the policies noted earlier. I think this could work, but is also very open to abuse (people adopting orphans for payouts/child abuse already prevalent in adopted children), so any execution would have to be subject to rigorous control. 

6. School/university education geared towards encouraging childlessness. It's clear that resources need to be consumed more efficiently, but even at peak efficiency, resources will be consumed. The best way to reduce one's environmental impact would be to not have children.

I want to make it clear that these policies will be totally voluntary - there is no hint of coercion. However, in order to ensure participants remain childless, there will likely a degree of enforcement required. For instance, participants will have to undergo vasectomies/tubal ligations. Naturally, government will have to create a framework to follow up on continued childlessness of participants. Having said that, government already has full knowledge of parents/children through its Aadhar database. Further, all participants will be subject to a vetting process to ensure that there is no coercion by people looking to make a buck off human misery.

Or can also set up a camp.

In  these unprecedented times and during a National crisis,hospitals are  gearing up to provide support to the  most vulnerable who will need  blood transfusions during the COVID 19  crisis during hospitalisation.  And for other emergencies.

Hospitals  are trying to do whatever little it takes to bring emergency  care  closer to people who would need during such times through their  blood  donation camps.

Dr Ram Bhatt who  is a practising nephrologist is organising  a blood donation camp at at  apartments who can give them space (2 beds 5  meters apart in club  house) or parking space for their bus. Bus can  handle one person every  20 minutes (inlcudes the core process and  cleaning/ changing of paper  sheet time).

Please read below for more information and share with anyone you know who might able to donate within our community.

We are appealing urgently to meet requirements during COVID 19 hospitalisations.

Our volunteer hub will help ensure utmost care is taken while making blood donations.

Here I give a behind the scenes tour when volunteers and residents arrive during this time( pics ) Video if my donation [https://youtu.be/6L91Av\_1wpI](https://youtu.be/6L91Av_1wpI) |More info [https://imgur.com/gallery/wHKSfFF](https://imgur.com/gallery/wHKSfFF)

Here is the problem. They don't live peacefully like birds. Dogs bark and make it impossible for you to walk esp at night. Sometimes they even bite you. You cannot take a walk in your street at night these days anymore. They pretty much terrorize you.

People have died and even fall off from the roof because of sudden monkey attacks. Monkeys destroy the public property esp cable system, cause faults and scare kids the most. We used to sleep on the roof at night when we were kids but it impossible to do because of all these monkeys terrorizing us.

I see people feeding them and effectively increasing their number which makes my blood boil. I feel people should stop feeding them. They all should be locked and taken to the jungle and left there forever. 

In civilized cities, there is no place for stray animals. If you disagree, tell me one reason why we shouldn't bring all other animals like deer, sheep, goats and have them live here? Can you imagine how it would be then?

When i started¬†a company,¬†it was hard for me to figure out , i used to campaign on my own, later i learnt ,i just have to get more people to work ,and keep getting more campaigns at higher prices.

Now,i just have to focus on two things, people and campaigns. If i have to expand my business ,i have to just increase  both . There is no such innovation needed , innovation just comes on the way. So ,the formula is so simple,you just have to focus on sales and your products. Just try to increase it . And there is no such innovation  needed to expand. You have just do more work , if you are making sales ,do more sales,making something ,keeping making more.

If the share you are purchasing, are not expanding that means they are just not doing the same work more and more ,on which their business is based on. It means they are not focused.

Take a 5 year horizon ,so if they are focused, a year is a long time ,they should increase year on year. They have to just do the same thing more and more. Its so simple. So ,if a business is not expanding , and cannot do that simple thing ,why will you ever invest in it.",1586539375.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,6,0

2769,"Is this story of Mahabharata true or not?There was question on Quora ""Why did karna Insult Draupadi""

One answer said First Draupadi insulted Karna and said him ""Sut Putra""(Charioteer Son) in her Groom Selection then he called her ""W"" In dice game in Hastinapur for little Revenge

It also Claimed he was just looking for some little verbal revenge on Draupadi but was not aware things will get worse. He used some words at Pandavs indirectly to get them stand against event. He was even planning that If Draupadi call him for help he will cut both Dushashan hands and even fight duryodhan If needed when Dushashan was Disrobing Draupadi as that insult of women was hard for him to see. 

Mahabharata is written by multiple writers and every writer changes some things but real Mahabharata was written but Vyas and I haven't read Real Mahabharata. 

Is this Karna and Draupadi thing true or just some wrong written Mahabharata?",1586522339.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,0

2771,"[Opinion] Governance and Administration participation culture must for better Electorates.I'm keen observer of Human Behaviour and reserve certain interest in Political System and how it shapes the Electorates.

The following views were formed earlier and had been reaffirmed when I listened to _The Seen and the Unseen podcast by Amit Varma Ep. 149 with Jayaprakash Narayan_

My view has always been to study and vote the Candidate most relevant to us, the MLA/MP of our own respective constituency. Is his primary focus on Party Worship or He also genuinely cares about the constituency and works towards it. Corruption has become inevitable evil that is to stay on account of Broken Electorate system of First Past the Post.

This method is akin to _Bottom to Top_ Approach of Management, where the Central Policy is the manifestation of Ground Reports of respective constituencies

Why do I feel is this most Important aspect that influences you're vote ?

1. Basic facilities of Sanitation, Garbage Collection, Law and Order and all such things are all the product of the local machinery in place. The Centre is an instrumental force in steering the Public policy. The real groundwork is laid by the local administration that has the task of implementing it.

2. It helps the Voter be a real part of Voting process as he is voting for a Candidate that'll tackle the issues that are of direct concern to him. It ensures that there is direct impact of the Vote he casts.

3. It helps in selection of Responsible Candidates who know that only real time work will lead to ensured retention of his office. And that an active voter base will have a scorecard in hand that will evaluate his performance time to time.

4. It will inculcate a culture of sustained Politics - direct involvement in decision making process of the constituency and nation building, opposite to the form now where it is goes into slumber at the end of an election cycle.

This is not a foolproof method to root out all evil of the Broken Electoral System. But I consider this a nudge in certain direction, maybe a base for greater changes in future.

One of my relatives died (Door ke mama) from a heart attack. He was a heart patient.

The hospital in which he was admitted told his family that you have to announce to the media that he died of covid-19 or we won't give you the body. After several requests they gave the body after 3 days (maybe after taking a large amount of money, bribe or something).

This was only because he was a muslim and this happened in a small town where hindus have already stopped buying from muslims and vice versa.

I am an exmuslim myself but when I heard this, first of all it made me sad that such things are happening in times when humanity should stand together and fight (not literally because social distancing. Hehe) but then it made realize, that coronavirus has done so much for muslims. It has killed all other causes of death itself. Now no muslim can die of heart disease or cancer or accidents etc.

Let us look into some more innovative measures around our country to tackle this COVID-19 scenario.

###### Affordable Diagnostic Kits

[Bione](https://www.bione.in/), a Biotech startup in Bangalore, has designed a kit for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 from the comfort of our home. The kit approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research ([ICMR](https://www.icmr.nic.in/)), promises to give the diagnosis result within 5 ‚Äì 10 minutes.

Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology ([IIT](http://www.iitd.ac.in/)) Delhi have also come up with a rapid diagnostic kit to detect the virus. The kit developed at Kusuma School of Biological Sciences is currently undergoing clinical trials at the National Institute of Virology ([NIV](http://www.niv.co.in/)) in Pune. Innovations in test kits will bring down the cost of testing and also give results within a short time-frame.

###### Bag-valve masks as Ventilators

Bag-valve masks are hand-held inflatable devices to support breathing in critical conditions. Professors from IIT Hyderabad have come up with a similar design that works with power from an electrical source, such as a car battery. The device is cheap, easy to manufacture and portable.

Professor Murty and Professor V. Eswaran from the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at IIT-Hyderabad, say,‚Äù the device could be manufactured for less than Rs 5,000, or one-hundredth the cost of a conventional machine.‚Äù

###### Portable Multi-feed Oxygen Manifold (MOM)

Vishakhapatnam‚Äôs Naval Dockyard personnel have found an innovative solution to meet the demand of ventilators to [treat COVID-19](https://www.intepat.com/blog/patent/the-global-patent-race-for-covid-19-vaccine/) infected patients. The MOM contains a six-way radial header fitted to one cylinder. This portable innovation can supply oxygen to six patients with one oxygen cylinder. MOM is an effective way to treat patients with limited resources available.

###### Herbal Sanitizers

Washing hands frequently can prevent the spread of COVID-19. All countries are stressing the importance of washing hands to keep ourselves safe from infection. The cost and demand for personal hygiene products have shot up around the country.

Students from IIT-Roorkee have prepared herbal sanitizers to promote personal hygiene. The sanitizers meet the regulations of [WHO](https://www.who.int/) and the US government health research institute (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/)).

###### Disinfectant Tunnel

A water treatment company in Tirupur, Tamilnadu has designed a disinfectant tunnel that can disinfect people as we walk through it. This portable tunnel is about 16-feet, made of stainless steel and fitted into a mild steel frame.

###### Arogya Setu and Corona Kavach App

The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology have collaborated to develop a COVID-19 exposure risk tracking applications. The beta version of these Apps will be of use to track if the user has any exposure to coronavirus patients. These Apps will track the user‚Äôs location and alert them if they come across a person who was tested positive for the virus.

##### Innovation Contests and Funding Events

Several government agencies and private sector companies have come forward to encourage and support innovations and designs developed to tackle the COVID-19 crisis.

###### COVID-19 Solution Challenge

The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has launched this challenge to involve active community participation around the country. The challenge is accepting solutions to help fight COVID-19. The best solutions that could be adopted in real life will be rewarded. The contest will give away prizes totaling to 1,75,000 INR.

The last date to [participate](https://innovate.mygov.in/covid19/) is 16 April 2020.

###### United Against COVID-19-Innovation Challenge

The department for the promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) with Startup India has announced an open call for all companies, startups, and innovators to offer solutions that can bridge the gap between the demand and supply of medical requirements used in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of COVID-19. The contest encourages innovators to work on med-tech, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Internet of Things, to come up with ideas, prototypes, and designs to combat COVID-19.

The deadline for [entries](https://www.startupindia.gov.in/content/sih/en/ams-application/challenge.html?applicationId=5e79126ee4b055bfaea9ef66) is 15 April 2020.

###### Challenge COVID-19 Competition (C3)

National Innovation Foundation ‚Äì India (NIF), an autonomous body under the Department of Science and Technology ‚Äì India has [announced](http://nif.org.in/challenge-covid-19-competition) a competition to find solutions to the most pressing problems in the COVID-19 scenario.

The C3 encourages innovations to reduce virus transmission, improve sanitizing facilities and enhance door delivery options for the elderly. Currently, the contest is accepting entries on a rolling application basis.

###### Centre for Augmenting War with COVID-19 Health Crisis (CAWACH)

The Indian Ministry of Science and Technology has formed the [CAWACH](https://isba.in/cawach/) to identify and support innovations of startups working on the novel, safe and affordable respiratory devices, personal protective equipment, diagnostics, and any other innovation to control and treat the spread of COVID-19. The Centre is equipped with funds amounting to 56 Crore and plans to identify 50 such innovations and take them to the next level.

Many State Governments have also come up with challenges motivating students, startups, innovators around the country to come up with innovative solutions to face this health crisis. The optimistic and encouraging environment is an ideal platform for budding innovators.

2903,"When will it be normal again?Anyone who thinks that there would be any revert to absolute ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù, isn‚Äôt paying attention at all. 

This is here to stay. We can test however much we want, the numbers will never reflect the actual infected. This lockdown will extend for a month or two more, at least in high effected zones and then perhaps a call would be taken to phase it out depending on the severity on our health infrastructure. Most metropolitan cities would have multiple containment zones and communities would be lucky to have no cases within. 

Those worried about the economy, do realise it‚Äôs in a free fall now and only a definite cure/vaccine can bring stability to the markets. Most industries will never bounce back to its old ways. Yes many will be unemployed and yes many will downgrade exhaustively from their respective class stature. 

We can only aim to adapt to these circumstances. Fortunate are those that lived miserly as they would have their emergency fund to bid their time. But to those worried sick about bleeding money, I appeal to their creative minds, try and find ways to figure what other opportunities can be looked into while we all bid our time. Ingenuity and innovation is the call we‚Äôd need to answer to because trust me, waiting to relapse into the old business ways isn‚Äôt going to bring it to us any sooner. 

We as a nation never gave importance to a just way of funding the much needed infrastructure that would have given us the fighting chance. We have full fledged extreme class divide, a media which is complicit in advocating polarity, absolute corruption runs deep in our veins, regulations are flouted by the rich and powerful and like termite we ate into the lives of our own, the ‚Äúchaltaa hai‚Äù rot bore deep and now to expect the same system to cohesively help all of us out is a fools errand. This isn‚Äôt pessimism, just plain old facts. Disaster management calls for a unified approach but just look at us, our bureaucracy is a testament to our incompetence  and non adherence on multiple levels. 

How can we expect governance to make this right when we ourselves collectively never cared for each other?

No statue high enough will fill us with pride as compared to the shame we‚Äôd feel to see the mountain of ashes of the dead when this is done with us.",1586552676.0,,Coronavirus,dark,20,11
2904,"What is the best western country for desi immigrants?A country that is most accepting and open to desi immigrants. I know europe is not that accepting and tolerant to south asian people. But I assume Canada and UK are better?

There is racism everywhere but is there a country where you will not feel like an outsider and it would feel like ""home""? Just blending in without getting any looks and weird behavior?

By accepting I mean if I live there I am Canadian or American or whatever the country is I am considered a part of it. I am not considered an immigrant anymore. I know in europe some people live their entire lives, get the nationality, learn the language and still considered an outsider by many. People are also very openly racist in europe in that they will give you looks of disgust or treat you poorly.

2982,"I built this tweet generator app for left-wing & right-wing Indian twitter (URL: http://botbaby.in/)I have generally been concerned about the way social media has been evolving in recent times. Esp. twitter with all the polarisation, fake news/trends, BOTs, trolling/abusing etc. Always wanted to do something about it. I am also a Machine Learning practitioner, interested in NLP, so I thought I can combine the two and build a few apps around it.

I am working alone so there is only so much I can do. More over I have to also balance it with doing stuff that would help me professionally.

So as I first step, I made a tweet generator app, that is trained on left-wing and right-wing Indian twitter. Idea is to drive home the point of falling social discourse, that if we don't do anything about it, this is how our kids will learn to speak.

You can try the app here: [http://botbaby.in/](http://botbaby.in/)

All the tweets are machine generated. None of them really exist, not even the individual sentences.

Please note that, if you enter a new prompt, then it needs to do inferencing (which involves starting a GPU machine) which can take upto a minute. While if you select an existing prompt then results would be returned immediately.

Please provide your feedback. All comments and suggestions are welcome esp, what further apps you think can be built to tackle the menace of social media. I have my own ideas but always good to get a few more of them.

2983,"The need to investigate the NSO Group, which was behind the Pegasus software, is now more than ever.&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p3vb8eexzxr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a80eb8a5aafc7092e4017557ca41921f18c872f1

**Tl;dr**

According to a Hindustan Times [**report**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/tech/pegasus-creator-nso-group-has-a-covid-19-software-why-you-should-be-worried/story-SMsYXKFoz9OPG2VBIKrA8L.html) dated April 07, 2020, the NSO Group has created a surveillance application to track COVID-19 infected patients which they have been actively pitching to almost a dozen governments around the world to use. This is the same company which was behind the Pegasus software that was used to hack the Whatsapp applications of a substantial number of Indian citizens mainly journalists and human rights activists in May and June of 2019. Mindful of the potential harms of this COVID-19 application being used by the Indian government, we wrote to the Chief Ministers of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh urging them to establish committees to investigate the Whatsapp hack. Our key recommendations were to include victim and expert testimony in the investigation which should be carried out in a transparent manner.   


**What happened?**

Last year on May 14, 2019, an [**article**](https://www.ft.com/content/4da1117e-756c-11e9-be7d-6d846537acab) published in the Financial Times for the first time reported that Whatsapp, ‚Äúdiscovered that attackers were able to install surveillance software on both iPhones and Android phones by ringing up targets using the app‚Äôs phone call function.‚Äù As per a statement by Whatsapp, this vulnerability was patched and closed. On October 30, 2019, Indian Express published a [**report**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/whatsapp-confirms-israeli-spyware-used-snoop-on-indian-journalists-activists-pegasus-facebook-6095296/) containing statements made by Whatsapp which confirmed that the victims of the hack in India were mostly Indian journalists and human rights activists. Of these a significant number are situated in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh as the hack targeted lawyers related to the Bhima-Koregaon case in Maharashtra and Dalit activists in Chhattisgarh.   


**What is the law related to hacking?**

Surveillance such as this which was carried through the Pegasus software developed by the NSO Group puts the personal and informational privacy of citizens at risk. This goes against the decision in J*ustice K.S. Puttaswamy vs Union of India* which affirms informational privacy as one of the facets of the right to privacy.   


Additionally, the Information Technology Act, which deals with interception of data, expressly prohibits hacking. Under S. 66 of the Act, hacking is a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five lakh rupees or with both.  


**Attempts at reputation laundering by the NSO Group**

We are bringing this up again right now because we are especially concerned about the operations of the NSO Group in India. It was reported in the Hindustan Times on April 07, 2020 that NSO has now developed a surveillance app to track the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The report also said that the NSO Group ¬†is ‚Äúactively pitching surveillance tools to their governments and to others around the world.‚Äù   


It was not made clear whether NSO has approached the Indian Government. However, since the NSO Group has already been accused of illegal surveillance, privacy experts are of the opinion that the company might try to exploit this crisis to market intrusive systems. [**The coronavirus pandemic presents a golden opportunity for corporate actors ¬†like the NSO Group to recast previously unpalatable behavior as life saving intervention.**](https://theintercept.com/2020/04/02/coronavirus-covid-19-surveillance-privacy/)  


**Our recommendations**

1. We recommend that the State governments of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh should establish an investigation committee to look into the hack committed in their state.
2. The Committee should have a fixed timeline in which to complete its investigation and submit its report to the State governments.
3. The Committee should allow for the victims (or legal counsel on their behalf) of the hack to testify before it.
4. The Committee should allow experts in the field of data privacy to testify before it.
5. The Committee should facilitate the registration of open FIRs and encourage that investigations are commenced immediately.
6. The Committee should operate in a transparent manner.

There‚Äôs no cure for Covid-19 yet.. what‚Äôs to stop anyone there from catching it again and repeating the cycle? 

2) PM cares relief fund : been getting a lot of forwards/ seeing praised on social media about who donated what amount and all... I thank them sincerely. Also, what‚Äôs happened to that amount? How is it being utilised and who‚Äôs benefiting from it? 

3) Jobs that aren‚Äôt paying salaries to their employees. How are those people and their families supposed to get by? How will they pay rent, bills and loans? (I know some banks have paused collecting EMIs for 2-3 months, but that communication was made via E-mail, I don‚Äôt think the majority of Middle Aged and Senior citizens would update themselves by checking their mailbox) 

4) I live in Bangalore and once A week, I  go to get essentials and each time, I see that the main road is sort of packed even during late afternoon and people are just sitting outside closed shops and are basically chilling, idk why the seriousness of this disease isn‚Äôt getting to everyone yet? And also the panic buying during each announcement of any lockdown or curfew. It‚Äôs less survival of fittest, and more survival of the douche-est. 

5) And that HCQ drug, what was that drama even for? It was evident he‚Äôd get it since Trump and Modi are basically FaceTime buddies at this point. 

6) The govt has been announcing different things (hold off rent, pay salaries, free ration, random people spraying things in ‚Äúmain roads‚Äù who also don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre spraying), anyways.. when are these things getting implemented? What is the solution for the middle class people who need that salary or have to pay rent? 

7) Why are they locking out pet food? Cz my local shop was pretty empty when I went in last week and had to buy different brands of food cz they were out and claimed that no new stock is coming in till this is clears up. 

8) Did everyone sign up on TikTok for real?",1586510164.0,,Coronavirus,dark,9,18

Our Process:
1) Requests received from hospitals are put in queue after verifying it is sent from a legitimate email address from a person in authority.  
2) We ask the hospital to get a quote from their vendor for the quality and quantity they need.  
3) We allocate funds for this as per the current amount raised and pay the vendor who will deliver the goods directly to the hospital - this will be against a GST invoice.  
4) Once a hospital receives the goods we will request them to share pictures and it's acknowledgement.  

So far we are working with the Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital (Delhi) and Hindu Rao Hospital. Urgent items required by them are PPE Kits (10,000 required), ICU PPE Kits (1,000 required) and Sanitisation Tunnels at hospital entrances.  

Two requests I want to make from r/india ->  
1) Please help us reach these goals and provide the necessary equipment to the hospitals. Please donate if you have money to spare / please share word so that those who can help / want to help have a platform to do so  
2) If you know any hospitals that need help with equipment please ask them to reach out to us regarding their needs.

No outrage from this, because the family is not Muslim and they will not be hounded by Media and the establishment. Now, almost everyday we are hearing news about hospitals being made containment zones because of corona outbreak in hospital premises and many doctors and hospital staff getting infected due to lack of PPE kits and proper guidelines, but still neither the media nor the people ask this government why it continues to let this happen. Why doesn't it provide the hospital with PPE kits? Why doesn't it expand the testing criteria? With the few hospitals and doctors we have, it must have been mandatory by to get each patient admitted in the hospital and hospital staff to get tested to prevent outbreak in hospitals.",1586505215.0,,Coronavirus,dark,2,8

https://preview.redd.it/ez9fp6o2mrr41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8321de6fea93331bdee6b452fb7f61a38c7d9960

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu & Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition was finally listed for hearing today i.e. 9 April 2020 before a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. During the hearing, the bench issued notice and the matter will be heard next after one week. 

### Background

Foundation for Media Professionals had filed a petition before the Supreme Court for restoration of 4G internet services in Jammu and Kashmir on 31 March 2020. The petition contended that the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir during the COVID-19 crisis violated fundamental rights to healthcare, education, livelihood and justice guaranteed by the Constitution of India. 

Despite the COVID-19 crisis gripping the country, the government has continued directing internet service providers to slow down internet speed in Jammu & Kashmir to 2G by citing security concerns. The most recent of these orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 was issued on [**03 April 2020**](http://jkhome.nic.in/22(TSTS)of2020.pdf) and it is due to expire on 15 April 2020.

2G is an outdated technology which was phased out in 2008 with the launch of 3G, and most modern websites and applications are too heavy to properly run on a 2G internet connection. While 4G internet services provide download speed of 150-300 Mbps, 2G internet services only provide download speed of upto 384 Kbps.

&#x200B;

[J&K Doctor's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/e1f5q5p6mrr41.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=61108bdc3b92f1d06a78a65a45332d2067dca842)

Due to denial of 4G internet services, healthcare professionals and ordinary people in Jammu & Kashmir have been unable to access the latest information about treatment and management of COVID-19 and relief measures. Further, patients are forced to flock to hospitals, which are hotbeds of infection, to consult doctors about COVID-19 and other ailments. This is because 2G internet services cannot support telemedicine which requires video to visually examine the patient. 

&#x200B;

[J&K Teacher's Tweet](https://preview.redd.it/ybr8hgv8mrr41.png?width=298&format=png&auto=webp&s=506f18b04aa10488edac202d812b8740ff515a54)

In addition to its impact on healthcare, the internet slowdown in Jammu & Kashmir is also preventing children from continuing their education through online tools. Children in the region have already suffered major disruption to their education due to the communication shutdown and lockdown imposed on 05 August 2019 after abrogation of Article 370. The COVID-19 crisis has forced schools to shut down again after re-opening earlier this year.

The government has fully embraced use of technology to combat the pandemic and it has launched a COVID-19 dashboard, WhatsApp chatbot and contact tracing app to widely disseminate accurate and latest information to the public and track spread of the disease. However, at 2G speed, the people of Jammu & Kashmir may be unable to access life saving information through these tools. For instance, the WhatsApp chatbot responds to queries with text, infographics and videos but downloading images and videos is difficult without 4G internet services.

### Hearing before Supreme Court

During today's hearing, a 3 judge bench of NV Ramana J., Subhash Reddy J. and BR Gavai J. issued notice to the standing counsel of Jammu & Kashmir and listed the matter for hearing after one week. This was the same bench which had earlier decided [***Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India***](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/), which related to the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu & Kashmir on 05 August 2019.

Senior Advocate, Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi represented the Foundation for Media Professionals during the hearing and we are extremely grateful to him for his efforts. We would also like to thank the wider legal team comprising of Advocate on Record, Shadan Farasat and Advocates, Vrinda Bhandari, Jahnavi Sindhu, Gautam Bhatia and Devdutta Mukhopadhyay who worked on this petition. IFF‚Äôs Executive Director and Advocate, Apar Gupta was also personally present with the Senior Advocate during today‚Äôs hearing which happened via video conferencing.

To showcase an example of how frugal we are 
We own an Alto 800.
We do not have an air conditioner even though temperatures regularly go above 45 degrees. 
We go out for dinner once in two-three months.
I barely spend more than 1500 rupees a month I am a college student.
Some of the furniture in our house is literally what someone in a hut has. 
We don't have a TV.
We don't have a Wifi connection only mobile data.

Why am I posting this because recently my friend said someone with 5 crores would have an Iphone 11 a Mercedes Benz etc why would he even study engineering in this college. I seriously have a 14k phone literally had to beg my dad for a new one just to play PUBG and everyone in my house uses a cheap 12-13k phone.
This really made me think over because I find it okayish I mean there are a few things that could be done.

3264,"This disease is showing us who the real parasites are in this countryMy parents are doctors and due to this outbreak, my father has been working 15 hours a day. This virus outbreak is causing a lot of problems for all hospitals. People who don't really require it are hoarding masks and other medicines. This has caused a grave problem as protective masks which you could buy for Rs.2.5 6 months ago are now being sold for ten times their price. This is morally wrong, unethical but sadly it is not illegal in [India](https://indiacorplaw.in/2020/03/price-gouging-in-the-age-of-coronavirus-an-analysis-of-the-regulatory-strategies.html) . This affects the people in the medical field the most as they are the ones who depend on these products the most.

All doctors are risking their lives by treating patients during this pandemic and they get screwed by the public. One day everyone was clapping which was originally planned as a gesture of appreciation for doctors and nurses. The next day we get news about [stone pelting](https://english.jagran.com/india/coronavirus-outbreak-health-officials-attacked-in-indore-during-covid19-patient-tracking-two-injured-watch-10010285) which had happened on doctors .Majority of the people of these country always had a certain hatred for doctors and the current situation would only intensify their hate towards them.

Most medical shops seemed to have closed down but in reality they have hijacked the cost of all the medications to 10-20 times their original price and are selling these essential supplies secretly. This is all really messed up that some people are trying (and succeeding) to profit  off of this.

When the doctors ask the government for help I think the government laughs at them. When there is an acute shortage of PPE, [the government has exported them to Serbia](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/even-as-docs-use-raincoats-india-exports-suits-to-serbia/articleshow/74957518.cms). Our dear and beloved PM has done nothing except tell everybody to clap and light some freaking candles. Also the Supreme Court decided that all private facilities capable of doing so must [test suspected carriers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/supreme-court-orders-free-coronavirus-testing-at-private-labs-1664802-2020-04-08) of the coronavirus free of charge. I don't think once this disease is contained that the government has the slightest intention of reimbursing the labs. Currently, the labs are supposed to test the patients for free and incur the loss as they themselves have to purchase the testing kits. I don't think these people who decided this understand how business/economy works.

I really hope something is done about ALL the things I have talked about. I honestly hope that the problems highlighted above are dealt with. Things are going to get worse before they get better. The lockdown will have to be extended. Please remember what the people who are responsible for treating the patients and who have to expose themselves are going through.",1586434259.0,,Coronavirus,dark,8,50

People avoid me and I avoid people. 


Issue is, it's kinda hard to be alone all the time. But I also don't want to change because frankly, people never change. 

I am also a danger to people around me so even my mom agrees to an extent that it might be good that no girls even like looking at me much less like me. So, despite her lifelong wish of seeing me married someday, some part of her doesn't want to get me married. 

Plus even if I did get married I don't want kids. And since this is India and not some western country, almost zero women would want a childfree life.


Anyway, tldr is that It's probably better for me and people around me that I spend my life alone, but at times I just can't take the fact that I don't have a girlfriend or even friends to talk to.

So how do I strengthen my mind so that I don't feel lonely or bad about any physical needs and stuffs. I just want to shut off the world and my own sexual desires completely so that my mind can be freed a bit.

PS: I actually view women as nothing more than sex machines. I guess I'm no different in than sex abusers and molesters.  But since I don't want to become a criminal and a news headline, I try to stay clear of shit.",1586466700.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,24,10

* All symptomatic individuals who have undertaken international travel in the last 14 days:

* All symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases.

* All symptomatic health care workers.

* All hospitalized patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (fever AND cough and/or shortness of breath).

* Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested once between day 5 and day 14 of coming in his/her contact.

It‚Äôs crystal clear that we‚Äôve a very restrictive testing criteria that only tests NRIs, foreigners and people who‚Äôre in direct with these people, including medical staffs. We are completely masking the community transmission of corona virus, since people who were directly in contact with those people might have come in contact with hundreds of other people. 

An example of this would be recent Nizamuddin Dargah and Shradhdha ceremony incidents where government only quarantined only those people who were directly involved in the events but those who attended these event might have further spread the virus to several other people, Several thousands or way more to be specific. 

One of the attendee of Jamat was a grocery shopkeeper in my uncle‚Äôs town, he was recently taken into custody. So, he alone might have come in contact with thousands of people before he was taken into custody. 

Also, last week 2 people died from corona virus in Dharavi slum, where millions of people are jam-packed in a tiny area, they use the same water-taps and toilets, apparently the government only tested 70 people in that slum and 15 tested positive. Which is no-where near the actual numbers, those 15 people might have come in contact with several hundreds or thousands of people in their own slum. 

If this goes on, I believe we‚Äôll completely ignore the community transmission and the fact that ‚Äúasymptomatic carries‚Äù of corona virus are the biggest cause of cases increasing exponentially in developed countries. 

I don‚Äôt think, Kerala flattening the curve is something to be happy about (yet). Since, they‚Äôve started rapid testings to check community transmission I believe that might give us a clearer picture of the situation.

Edit: yesterday, they‚Äôve added the criteria of testing symptomatic people, to check community transmission. Hope, it brings a more accurate statistics of infected cases.

Hope you're staying safe in these troubled times. 
It's probably not the right time to ask questions like the one I'm going to ask now but I really need your help. 
So here's the scene. 

I've just finished my undergrad degree and have been approached by a startup to be a co-founder. Basically, it's a startup in the legaltech industry and they want someone with both legal and tech experience to take the company forward. 

It's two years old and is incubated by one of the leading law firms in the country. This firm is mentoring and guiding the team and the team is looking to raise its first funding round come September. 

Upon speaking to the founder, I found him to be quite passionate and hardworking. We have been on call a few times since then, and we have exchanged business ideas and strategies about the marketplace and the future of the startup. 

Here's a rough idea of the deal I'm getting offered. 
He's offering me an equity stake in the company. (The valuation or the percent stake is not crystallized yet but is negotiable). 
My rent and meals will also be taken care of. Transport cost is negligible as the place is situated close to the incubator. 
In addition, I've asked him that I would like to draw a salary as well for my miscellaneous personal expenditure (Sutta, daaru etc) 
This startup is based out of Delhi. 

What I want to know is this a good deal? I've spoken to a few people in the startup scene and have gotten mixed reviews although the majority want me to go ahead and take this gig. 

I do want to join this startup. It offers me responsibility, and I'm reading and learning about my job everyday and its super fun. 

What I'm confused about is the deal that I'll strike with them. How much equity stake should I ask for? How much salary should I ask? ( They're bootstrapped and living off of cash prizes won off several hackathons). 
Any other questions which might be pertinent to ask? so that all formalities are taken care off and I can start work at the earliest. 

Please help out a brother in need!

Why can't we have these tests free or at a subsidized cost so that more people can get tested ?

I think the more we test the more accurate a picture we get of the magnitude of problem.

During summers apartments get quite hot during the daytime, and night time temps are typically 5-10 degrees lower. At night (around 11pm-midnight) the indoor temp is often 5 degrees or more higher than the outdoor temp. Opening windows to promote air exchange is a rather slow process and also results in dust coming in, hence we end up running an AC for 20-30 min to cool just one room. 

&#x200B;

Instead, is it practical to have a high volume intake fan attached to a window, with a HEPA filter. Run this intake fan for a few minutes to flush out the air inside the room with fresh air from outside through the filter. This would instantly cool the room to the outside temp, and also instead of running an AC consuming 1000-1500W, the initial reduction would come from a fan consuming 100 watts or so.

I don't know if it's allowed to post this here but I don't know what to do ....I'm scared shitless right now. 

Basically I'm having a crisis .... 

I'm having intrusive thoughts about well ... Scary things .....

It started with an obsession about being accused of something falsely based on my post history and search history . Though I'm not doing anything suspicious.... But I still had the fear due to me being from a poor family ... 

That escalated to ""maybe I am actually a criminal"" ... This seemed like an irrational thought but I started believing it out of fear and having additional thoughts like maybe I'm an insane criminal etc . And that this world is a hallucination and that in reality I'm a criminal... I'm still scared that this is a part of my updated fear  escalated to well ... That I'm going to hell and that my life would become miserable to the point of death ....

Now the fear is because of a dream I had a while ago about how my life would become really scary and that I'd be drifted apart by everyone and would be hated and that I would hurt them too . Or maybe that I was never loved and that I wouldn't be able to return to my loved ones

And that I'd lose everything basically .... Which really scared me a lot . And in those dreams was a mysterious figure who looked like Ryuk from the Anime Death note , mocking me . I was scared for some time but the fear subsided . Now I'm getting scared even more ... Because some details in that dream became true ... Like me contemplating suicide or drugs.... But I was scared that that wouldn't be an end to it . It seems similar to right now...... Which is really scary 

Especially the ""not returning to loved ones part"" 

Most of my friends are online and I'm in a long distance relationship ..... And because of those anxieties , I haven't contacted them ..... And I've been scared shitless ...... 

Many of the other things I'm noticing are ""signs"" like typos , writings , ads and specefic coincidental wordings and events occuring that I take as ""warnings"" ......  And some bad things happening with me lately .... Even my mom is acting weird ... This all seems determinential ..... It's so scary .... Thinking of an eternal being waiting to torture you for eternity ......

I even saw 2 anime that matched the dream like Babylon and Hell girl ....... 

Because of which I'm unable to let my guard down ....

And it's really scaring me ......

Even if most relegions might not have hell ... I'm scared of there being a different hell .... From relegions ... That is eternal .... It's really scary and ruining my health

I'm scared of this possibility and don't know what to do ....",1586450424.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,25,36

These items not necessarily comes under essential goods but I think its still not right. When I ask about it they get easily agitated saying ""lena hai to lo ya jao"" and reasons like high demand are the replies.

3474,"Calling all the app developers to help fight depressionWe all know that in this world of corona virus people are more depressed because of job losses, domestic violence, uncertain future etc.

I basically want to make an app where people can seek free counselling / talk to someone . 

The app just connects people who want to talk/ vent their heart out with people who want to listen and allows them to chat over text. No video, audio , image sharing , emoji bs. 

You must be like why would anybody want to listen because many people  are bored with all forms of social media and want to have a real connection. 

Why would a person talk because sometimes somethings is bothering them and they do not have a proper outlet / person to talk especially who doesn't judge them or thinks they are crazy.

Truth be told I did make such a app in the past with my own hands and it sucked bad. I had a lot of connection issues, privacy issues , security holes, trolling and lack of beta testers and got my hands burned. 

You can see /r/247buddy to see how bad it was.

This time  I want to fund this app and seek app developers who believe in this cause. 

Right now as per my research there aren't proper apps out there, people think suicide hotline  is the only option. 

You may ask I should reach out to Deepika Padukone and her ngo but I feel they have done a poor job in promoting what they do infact they haven't done much.  And their hotline isn't that amazing.

In my app the listeners will have to register and have to go through a basic vetting process. The vetting process will be in adherence to the guidelines set by our counsellors . I am trying to reach out counsellors for this.

Note this app will be free to use and on top of that I don't expect to make a single dime out of it. Yes It has to be non profit as I know my audience they cannot  afford to talk to counsellors.


So based on what I said I hope the app developers who contact me aren't expecting too much money from this. I don't mind paying for your coffee/pizza and internet bills nothing more than that.      

Please lets make this happen people.",1586452859.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,16
3475,"Why do we believe in God?Have you really seen God? Then why do you believe in him? I came out with 3 reasons for it.

1. Age old manuscript/knowledge and books:

So, we are passed on from Generations the books like Gita, Bible, and Quran and many others. And people telling it from so long. The story of Ram and Krishna passed on through ages. It‚Äôs true or not, it does not matter. It was so beautifully written and embedded that even its not true. It‚Äôs worth considering. And no one can prove it wrong anyhow, why? that we will discuss in the third point.

2. Exceptional bliss, fortune or lottery:

So, there are times people experience, so-called God bliss. By that, I mean a person facing a lot of issues in life may be due to a different person or someone. And after some time, like a lottery everything becomes fine, everything is so great around.

I think this happens with most of the people around. And that is how I think life is a game of probability that is not evenly distributed or maybe it is even. It‚Äôs like someone is so happy, someone is so rich, someone life is getting turned at this very moment, someone is poor, someone is going to die after a second of birth.

Its all a game of probability, opportunities are probable, sometimes it is such that you hit a six at times when you are at the worst part of life, and you believe there is an external force acting and yes, it is. It is the force of probability.

And yeah, you may think it doesn‚Äôt happen with everyone, its probability, It happens with some people, so why everyone still believes in God. It‚Äôs because, if it happens to one, and the one is watched by many. So, everyone thinks, ya there is some force and there is some God. Maybe there is‚Ä¶

3. You cannot prove something, that doesn‚Äôt exist:

So, a great philosopher. I don‚Äôt remember exactly who, once said if anyone asks you, do god exists or not. You can say yes, it exists. Why?

Because if God exists, you are right. And if he doesn‚Äôt exist, then you can never prove something that doesn‚Äôt exist. Like if I say, I am seeing a God, a unicorn or something in this room, and even if it exists or not. You will say it does not. But in this infinite, exponentially expanding universe, that you cannot see, how will you prove that a thing/force does not exist. You cannot prove negativity. You cannot prove things that don‚Äôt exist. You can only prove things that exist.",1586448028.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,32,15

Translation : 

&#x200B;

The streets were completely deserted.

Was unaware of my innocence.

The calamity that came

From the huts to the havelis were disturbed.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

All were imprisoned in their nests,

The flight of the bird was free.

Everyone cares about their loved ones,

Here my mother was upset with my hunger

Was a father,

Part of which was more sin than virtue.

Drunk of the morning item,

Pete was at night in the myth of Pete manhood.

&#x200B;

More than death, she was afraid of her God,

Perhaps that's why she used to stay at work all day.

Now sobs were also slow due to beating of weeks,

My mother was in a prison with a sinner. 

&#x200B;

Ration at home was also less,

More than an empty stomach, conditions were lost.

Don't know who was guilty of this plight,

To my ignorance, the government was the soldier of the street.  


&#x200B;

Days were passing like months,

Was waiting for help, sorry for the poor.

Now guess what, what to tell, was government business,

The months have gone by.  


Then some angels came every day,

Seemed to have come in search of a poor.

Four cameras were also brought with half a kilo of potatoes,

Did not know that they had come to give something, or had come to buy self-respect.  


It was heard again and again that the poor thing is poor,

Not everyone will be able to give it to those who are close.

Someone's eye on me too,

Leave it to the voice, it is a favor, it is a strange addiction. 

Knowing in a prickly heart that I am poor,

&#x200B;

Then there was also a feeling of how close to reality I am

A question also arose in the mind,

palace had come to my hut to erase the lust of their virtue,

Then how am I poor?

Am I poor?",1586459157.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,27

If people want it to stay this way, changes will need to be made. But it‚Äôs clearly not possible to implement US style exhaust catalysts made of platinum and which cost almost as much as a new car in India. What alternatives are there to using expensive exhaust catalysts? 

About a decade ago the US experimented with natural gas trucks. Hundreds of thousands were produced. The experiment failed not because the trucks did not work, but because the corporations which owned them turned down the power to save fuel and this made drivers refuse to drive them. They could not drive safely with such little power on such heavy vehicles. 

The trucks actually worked well when they were not restricted with poorly conceived programming from office workers who had no idea what they were doing. 

These systems are already proven and can be installed on existing trucks. In fact, there are thousands and thousands of them sitting idle on dealer lots in the US right now. If the government or companies wanted to try them out they would not even need to spend anything on development. It‚Äôs already developed. They can simply install existing systems or import cheap US trucks nobody wants. Just remember to use proper programming and drop the corporate nonsense. 

**As an added bonus, adopting these systems would also allow India to use its large natural gas reserves instead of having to import diesel. India imports 82% of diesel.**

It seems like NG trucks would be very beneficial to India in more than one way.",1586456799.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,2,7

3519,"ITS LOCK ON for Indian Real Estate  

***LOCK ‚Äì ON means 'Disambiguation' which refers to the removal of ambiguity by making something clear.***

We never would‚Äôve imagined a day when 1/3rd of world‚Äôs population would be in a lockdown. While the wrath of the lockdown has totally changed our lives, putting our work and finances in a jeopardy, our future will depend largely on how we utilize the time available today. The lockdown gives us ample of time to ponder upon key decisions taken and to be taken, explore avenues for reviving the finances, make mindful investments and rectify the unpreparedness with which we are facing today‚Äôs situation. Make a choice now, whether you want to repent over what went wrong or make lemonade out of the lemons life (or the virus) has thrown upon us. If you choose the latter, then this article is for you to read ahead. 

This pandemic has rightly taught us that **uncertainties come unexpectedly.** How prepared are we to face an adverse situation again?

Businesses are adversely hit and job security has gone for a toss, leaving us in a catch 20 situation. Talking about investments, the FDs, Stocks, shares that we invested in are witnessing negative returns. Our priced possessions like jewelry and gold are locked up in banks and not helping us get through the situation. Fancy cars are stationed in parking lots, unused. The alternate investment options like SIPs, Mutual Funds too aren‚Äôt performing. 

Remarkably, **one thing that has stood between us and the disaster is HOME**. A sense of safety and security that a home brings for a family is irreplaceable. It is a physical as well as an emotional comfort zone where one heals and recuperates through tough times. Man, right from the stone age has been wandering in search of a home (caves), to protect himself, establish a family, dwell in and flourish. 

A critical question arising out of the Covid19 scenario is **what will be the fate of home buying and Real Estate post the lockdown?**

Studies and reports suggest that the real estate sector will decline; witnessing the worst hit till date and survival will be a challenge. However, as said by Benjamin Franklin, ‚ÄúOut of Adversity comes Opportunity‚Äù. The sector also flashes rays of positivity and you would be intrigued to know about the potential to INVEST in Real Estate, against all the current odds. 

Real Estate will be the most reliable investment option, considering the conditions of banks, share market crash and capital depreciation or any other option that may appear to be safe initially.

**Why will the Indian Real Estate sector grow faster than that of the world?**

1. The world economy will go into recession this year with a predicted loss of trillions of dollars of global income due to the coronavirus pandemic, spelling serious trouble for developing countries, with the likely exception of India and China, according to a latest UN trade report.

2. The virus pushes U.S.-Chinese relationship towards fracture; the fallout from the global pandemic threatens the recent U.S.-Chinese trade deal and could undermine future global stability. This rift will lead India to gain interests of global investors and companies. These investments open doors for better infrastructure, leading to the opening of multiple employment opportunities. These factors directly balm the upward movement of real estate in India.

3. China lost its goodwill and trust from investors and the corporate world, owing to the   
 (rumored) conspiracies in the way the country handled the spread of COVID 19 to the world. After China, India is the only country with the capacity to handle the magnitude of the Global scale, in terms of manpower, resources, transport systems, etc.

4. India so far, has augmented trust in handling corona and has bravely fought pandemics in the past too. Indian Real Estate gains appreciation form world economists for its perception as a Nation full of values and ethics, leading India with great avenues to become a Global Superpower.

5. NRI investment in real estate is bound to improve amidst Rupee fall.

While the above conditions make India a lucrative hotspot of real estate investments, below are few points to consider towards real estate buying: 

 **Emotional Investment**: In India, owning a home is a matter of pride and esteem. The sentiment runs around passing the home possession as a heritage from parents to the future generations. Interestingly, after our first name, ‚ÄòHome‚Äô is second most used Word in the world every day. Ultimately, whatever be the circumstances people across the World will not stop investing in a home or buying real estate. 

**Statistics:** The Indian Real estate growth trajectory, since the past few years was likely to emerge stronger and is projected to be USD 650 Bn by 2025 and USD 1,000 Bn by 2030. Residential, commercial and Retail are the three key asset classes, which have primarily been contributing to the sector‚Äôs growth. Real estate contributed nearly 6% to India‚Äôs GDP in 2017. As per the projected growth trends, the sector‚Äôs contribution is likely to rise to 13% of India‚Äôs GDP by 2025.

¬∑ **Real Estate ‚Äì Largest Employment Generator:** After agriculture, Real estate is the largest employment generator in the country, creating tremendous opportunities for the skilled and unskilled workforce. **India‚Äôs Real Estate employee base is estimated to be 67 Mn by 2022.**

¬∑ **High Tangible Asset Value:** Real estate is not paper money, this is the asset you can hold tangibly which again increases its reliability and return on investment.

¬∑ **Competitive Risk- Adjustment Returns :** Based on July 2018 data from National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries **(NCREIF),** private market **Commercial Real Estate returned** an **average of 9.85% over the past five years.** This credible performance was achieved, together with low volatility relative to equities and bonds, for highly competitive risk-adjustment returns. 

¬∑ **Attractive and Stable Income Return (Specially in Commercial space):** The **rental yield from real estate is much higher than returns on any traditional sources of investment**. Commercial investment can yield upto 12% ROI and lowest to 5% ROI (with capital appreciation) depending upon the construction stage and lease terms of the property.

¬∑ **Inflation Hedging:** The inflation hedging capability of real estate stems from the positive relationship between GDP growth and demand for real estate. As economies expand, the demand for real estate derives rents higher and this, in turn, translates into higher capital values.

¬∑ **Long Term ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Wealth Building Asset with ‚ÄúPredictable ‚Äú Returns and least Risk** :- Real Estate helps you build wealth in long term due to dual advantage of Regular **‚ÄúPredictable‚Äù Returns (yield is higher than Dividend Returns) and an ‚ÄúAssured‚Äù Capital Appreciation in long term**, don‚Äôt be scared of Corporate Scams, while they can affect the company‚Äôs stock price or your bank‚Äôs health, but it cannot junk out the value of real estate you own 

¬∑ **‚ÄúHelps you Raise Money Quickly‚Äù** \- **Hard Asset is the most preferred collateral for a Bank**, to raise capital through a loan (LAP/LRD) your property is the best asset you could own!

¬∑ **The Ever Rising FSI Benefit** \- **‚ÄúWine and Real Estate improve with Age‚Äù** \- While as per accounting standards real estate is not a depreciating asset, in practical life too an older development can reap benefits of redevelopment wherein due to ever increasing FSI norms of MMR the incoming developer would not only offer rent for transit accommodation and corpus as hardship allowance, but also offer at least 25% to 30% enhanced Area (which is of great value as remember, 1 sq.ft of Real Estate in Central Mumbai is valued more than 10 gram of gold) !!

¬∑ **Work from Home Culture:** We are in the middle of the largest test of home-working in history and corporates are adopting, refining and testing policies, processes and infrastructure to make it work. We expect quarantine protocols to encourage work-from-home initiatives and for these practices to be adopted in new geographies as the contagion spreads. Large multinationals who recently, and publicly, announced the scaling back of home-working practices now indicate a desire to embrace widespread use of this practice until the outbreak passes. So commercial demands and co-working space or bigger house may increase.

¬∑ **Student Housing:** An unusual market development that is gradually emerging is student housing in India. Real estate consultancy firm, Anarock Property Consultants says that of the 37 million students pursuing higher education in India, more than 75% live away from home. Existing hostel facilities can accommodate only 18%-20% of this migrant student population. Developers in Mumbai & Pune have already ventured into this space that offers 7% returns.

¬∑ **Co-living market** size across India‚Äôs top 30 cities is expected to grow more than double by 2025 to $13.92 billion from current $ 6.67 billion. The demand for co-living in terms of beds is slated to grow to 5.7 million from 4.19 million, while the share of private beds is likely to rise from 15% to 30% of total demand in the co-living segment, showed a Cushman & Wakefield India report.

¬∑ **REITs are a great investment avenue** not only for institutional investors but also for retail investors, who find it difficult to invest in the commercial real estate, which has a better rent yielding than residential properties. Unlike other equity investments, REITs provide assured returns to the investors through a compulsory dividend distribution policy. REITs are mandated to distribute 90% of their net distributable income as dividend. There is also a further upside potential for the investors from periodic property valuations. India's first listed REIT, has gained 50% since listing in March 2019 as against a 10% gain in the Nifty Realty Index and 5% return of the benchmark Nifty 50.

¬∑ India‚Äôs improved rank on **Ease of Doing Business** and the courage to implement reforms such as DeMo, RERA, and IBC are indeed creditworthy. These are expected to yield fruitful results in the future and help establish Indian real estate as a preferred destination for global investors, occupiers, and homebuyers.

**WHY REAL ESTATE DURING LOCKDOWN?**

Probably most of the people interested in buying real estate would be holding their decision till the lock down opens due to speculations in the market or risk pertaining to economic conditions. Yet for any **clever investor who is observing the current market will testify buying of real estate during lock down to be the smartest move. Here is why ‚Äì**

1. **Reduction in Home loan rates:** On 27 March 2020, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 75 basis points (bps). The reduction saw the repo rate reduce from 5.15% to 4.40%. New home loan rates start at 8% from 1 March 2020. So indeed this is good time to buy your home if the decision was just hiding behind the corner for some better rates or good units.

2. **Low Demand ‚Äì Value for Money:** Real estate is facing deficit demand in the market which leads to generation of various attractive offers by Developers. To maintain the good books, builders are currently offering very low rates, lucrative payment plans and additional offers resulting in lowering the cost of property. End-user can expect to buy a property as low as the launch price during this lock down.

3. **Reduction in Stamp Duty:** The Maharashtra government on March 6 announced that it is reducing stamp duty on properties by 1% for Mumbai, MMRDA Region and Pune for a period of two years.

4. **Passive Income:** Various small investment options are being introduced in the market starting as low as 5 lacs in real estate that too with a rental income. This is again an opportunity to create a separate asset class in your portfolio and start a source of passive income.

5. **Demand- Supply breakthrough:** Due to low demand, discounted rates on good inventories are available. But once the economic condition will start settling, the bargain will reduce and demand will also start floating upwards. The rates will not be as low as they are now during lock down.

6. **Segment Shift** : Earlier Lower middle class people used to buy 10 to 12 Lakh property. Now middle class will buy those as an investor and rent it out to lower middle income group. Similarly shift will take place on affordable segment likewise. Middle income group will emerge as new investor community.

7. **Strike the Iron when it is Hot:** We all must have heard this at least once. But it‚Äôs time to implement the strategy to gain extensive returns on the investment. Not only the rates are strikingly low, the return on investment that are being offered by some Developers is as high as 15-18%.

**Final Thoughts:** 

**Your Money is SAFE IN Indian Real Estate**

\- Regulator like MahaRERA leading the cause of timely justice, 

\- High Court Judiciary being extremely proactive and pro-consumer / investor, 

\- NCLT giving prompt hearings and orders favoring customer and financial institution and lastly 

\- The Supreme Court judgment re-affirms the rights of the homebuyers as financial creditors under the bankruptcy code.... 

Simply put, it means that homebuyers share equal rights of recovery in the developer's assets which are liquidated as part of the bankruptcy process

**The Bottom Line**

**Real Estate cannot be lost or stolen, nor can it be carried away, purchased with common sense, paid in full, and managed with reasonable care , IT IS ABOUT THE SAFEST INVESTMENT IN THE WORLD.**

Real estate is a distinct asset class that is simple to understand and can enhance the risk and return profile of an investor‚Äôs portfolio. On its own, real estate offers competitive risk-adjusted returns, with less principal-agent conflict and attractive income streams. Though ill-liquidity can be a concern for some investors, there are ways to gain exposure to real estate yet reduce ill-liquidity and even bring it on-par with that of traditional asset classes. Real Estate investing even on a small scale, remains a tried and true means of building an individual‚Äôs cash flow and wealth.

**‚ÄúBUY Real Estate in areas where the Path EXISTS , AND Buy MORE Real Estate where there is no PATH, but YOU can Create Your OWN. Don‚Äôt WAIT to BUY Real Estate , BUY Real Estate and WAIT.**

3560,"CS career question: Leaving lesser known company in 4 months of joining for AmazonI work at a lesser known company in India as SDE. Joined fresh out of a good college at okay salary (around 14 LPA total compensation). Never got a chance to interview for Amazon in college so took a chance and interviewed and got selected(the interview wasn't very difficult and I didn't do very well in the difficult round)

Pros:
The increment I am getting in my current compensation is huge (9+ lakh, this includes bonus as well with base around 16), not counting the stocks
I am also getting a brand name for my resume
Work on higher scale. Also, current company has lots of tech debt and not a very clear plan for future whereas Amazon's team looks good
Current company is not growing very fast and although we have been assured no layoffs due to corona, I don't exactly trust the senior management
I will have better opportunities ( non tech as well) at amazon

Cons:
Leaving so early makes me look greedy for future employers

I love the culture at my current team ( no on-call, friendly people but not exceptionally knowledgeable)

I work much more efficiently (for 12 hrs daily currently and like it) and am very deadline oriented but in a friendly environment where there's not much anxiety about getting fired which I believe is opposite of Amazon's culture

With this high salary there would surely be higher expectations as fresh grads who will join with me will be getting 20% less base than me so what if I can't get the job done and I won't even be able to leave in case things don't work out as I already would have left current company in 4-5 months


Can someone experienced help me make a decision.

3577,"LPT: you can use aftershave instead of hand sanitizer.Soap water works best no doubt, but having access to running water when you're outside could be a challenge. And you have to step out to get essentials, or even delivery someday.


The hang Sanitizer market has recovered somewhat, and you can get one from time to time in chain pharmacies. But if you don't have, and worried about going to market, then carry your aftershave with you.


Now, there are three caveats:


1. Your aftershave needs to contain alcohol. How to know? If it burns your skin like magma, post shaving, it has alcohol. Most commerical aftershaves have over 60% alocohol easily. But do read the label. Lotions will not work.


2. You hands gonna smell really strongly for a few hours. Reconsider this if you have to eat or pick up veggies immediately. Unless, after returning home, you wash it with soap and water.


3. Cost. Aftershaves are far costlier than most hand sanitizers. But then again, this is an one off scenario.. can't hurt.",1586386603.0,,Coronavirus,dark,5,2

Also, utilize this time to clean and actually put Swachh Bharat initiative into action so that when the covid19 pandemic get over we can return to live a life in a better and cleaner India making hygiene a priority in our beautiful country.     


Just a random thought. I believe we would never get a better chance at making people realize hygiene is important and making our country cleaner and beautiful than ever.

3637,"What happens when Swiggy/Zomato order is cancelled because no delivery partner was able to deliver?Does the restaurant charge swiggy/zomato for the order?

edit. answer by TintinQuarantino420 is very comprehensive
> There are two phases for Swiggy
1.) Before order is accepted by the restaurant : If the customer cancels before that, then the customer gets the complete refund. Restaurant doesn't get paid anything.
2.) After the order is accepted by the restaurant : Customer will get only x% of amount as refund the remaining (100-x)% is given to the restaurant after swiggy commission
3.) Outlier cases : Customer has fought for a genuine reason (order too late etc) then comes 2 cases again
a.) Restaurant has marked food ready but delay is from delivery partner assignment:(this will apply to the case you mentioned, but delivery partner not being available is an almost impossible case)
Swiggy bears the complete cost of cancellation
b.) Restaurant is delaying food prep :
Restaurant bears the canceling charges given as refund to the customer.
If restaurants mark food ready without it being ready, a common pattern of cases will result in a penalty on the restaurant.
If, there is something different about food prep time compared to what historical data suggests about the restaurant then it will be investigated with the restaurant needing to bear cost unless it can genuinely prove otherwise. This is because delivery partner assignment has food prep time as a factor in deciding when and who to assign",1586414032.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,16

I fully condemn the tablighi Incident, however i do not subscribe to the hatred spewed against ALL Indian Muslims based on that incident. I welcome criminal proceedings against the organizers of tablighi Jamaat who flouted the law, but please do not hold ALL Muslims responsible for the actions of a select few.

Also i think these religious gatherings are not limited only to a single community

All religious gatherings need to be highlighted by the media, if at least to educate the locals and to put pressure on local governments into taking precautionary measures and containment measure to stop the spread of Corona virus.

(pulled from a tweet ...so did not individually check the numbers )

&#x200B;

EDIT : What happened After the Tablighi Jamaat was criminal .....i.e the maulvi's & some participants not co-operating with Indian authorities

Although there were larger gatherings of Hindu's as well ...i do not think they have (luckily, as yet) spread the virus. Why? because there is no way the virus would not have been detected and linked to some of them cause devotees (60,000) come from across India.

Yogi was and will always be a religious bigot and an idiot. and Yes there were foreigners in some of the gatherings too (ISCON)

However, targeting one community and calling it corona Jihad or whatever is wrong.

So I am a high school student who lives in west bengal. My elder  brother works for a paper press company . I dont want to name the company but it presses the qustion papers for West Bengal board. 

So let's get to the point. Last night, around 11:22 pm my brother's boss called him and told him that  he has to go to work from tomorrow (which is today) for 4 days because of some production that is on hold for the lockdown. When my brother said he cannot go because he has a daughter and don't want to get her infected through him. His boss told him that he has to go to work otherwise he will lose his job. Boss said that he is going to send a car for him(don't think my brother is on a high rank) . But ,he wont be alone. Five of his co workers were also ordered to go to work. So, the six of them will go in a car in which way the practice of social distancing is not happening.

What worries me is how easy it was to polarise him against a race, how easily he goes on to blame a community, despite all the education he's received. I used to think this communal violence and hatred stemmed from lack of proper education, but no.

India doesn't have the capacity to make any of them . Should they behave like that too ?

We don't have the capacity to manufacture ventilators . We import them .

We don't have the capacity to manufacture the high grade PPE required for this pandemic . The local manufacturers need machines from foreign nations to make it . Hence we have to import them too 

We don't have the capacity to make advanced drugs . India mostly makes generic medicines . Hence we need to import them too .

Now think of the pain and hardship if other nations retaliate against India and ban the exports of above mentioned items to India as tit-for-tat move for our ban on export of HCQ to them .

People need to stop with their kneejerk and short term style of thinking


USA and Europe already have a shortage of ventilators and masks . Despite that they haven't forced their companies in any way to not sell to foreign nations . In fact when trump tried to do that in USA against Canada , he was shat on by everyone and given the middle finger . 

However , if India goes ahead with ban on medicine exporters , then trump will be proven correct and his standing will be strengthened.

3796,"BSNL ADSL Broadband : ThoughtsOkay, so since the past few weeks, I've been getting really pathetic speeds on my BSNL Broadband. I know it's because of the overload in internet traffic due to the nationwide lockdown, and I'm not complaining about that. I use a 2.4 GHz router, it's practically ancient at this point, but I never really felt the need to change, and I'm regretting that decision now. The speeds had gotten really slow lately and I was getting disconnected every five minutes.

But then, all of a sudden, the internet went out. Poof. Gone. There was a solid red light in my router, instead of green. Then it would switch back and forth between a red light and no light at all. I figured it was because I hadn't paid my bills for March owing to the COVID-19 scare, it sorta slipped my mind. So two days back, I paid my bills via Amazon, for BOTH March and April altogether, and the Internet still hasn't returned. I tried tweaking around with the DNS settings, resetting my router, checking the ADSL splitter and cables, so far, nothing's worked. I tried calling the BSNL Broadband Customer Service . No one's picked up. Even though I've heard that telecom companies are supposed to stay open amidst the lockdown.

I'm seriously pissed at BSNL right now. I've had to use mobile hotspots these past few days, and its really inconvenient.

Living in Silchar, Assam, I don't really have much choice with high-speed FITH connections, (aside from JioFiber, I guess?), and I've got a soft spot for BSNL too, but this is getting on my nerves. Either give me my Internet back, or give me my money back.

Now the plan is expiring on the 10th and he claims there is at least Rs. 400 left to be used. According to the SMS he received, his services will stop if he does not recharge. Note: they do not specify what services will stop after the plan expires.

I'm confused because this is a local number and I thought the IR pack I used was just to charge his phone with IR facilitates. So because now that he is back in India, I thought that even if that expires, his number and the local services it comes with should still work...right?

Side note (which I am not sure is relevant): When he went abroad, even though his number was charged, IR facilities were not working and a customer care person explained that he would have to charge his number with some other plan of Rs. 400-500 to get the pack to work. I'm not sure if this is how IR really works.

Can someone explain what exactly will happen if he does not recharge? Is it that all services will stop entirely, or only IR facilities? Will he still get incoming calls, even from abroad, or will even that be cut? Thanks in advance.",1586346587.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,7

We(M22|F25) are in relationship from past three year.
We both have already planned for marriage after being in relationship for 1 year .



We also know each other since high school so we are quite compatible and have a good understanding of each other.



Things are going not as I supposed to go .


Now she have changed her mind completely.


A brief background about her - She have a poverty based childhood and she have worked part time throughout her life to afford her family needs and her father was nothing less than a person just existing,never supported her and her mother.


Even now she and her mother supports the family.


No one respects her family as they are poor.


She feel no one respects her in society because they are poor which is true considering Indian society mentality.



Now she refuse to Marry me saying she would marry someone richer as I am also not in very good financial condition though I have a job in computer science field and I need three more years to settle down completely and her family will be marrying her after two year.


She wants to marry someone richer as groom is expected to be earning more than bride in Indian society so she do have chances of marrying someone settled.
She wants to rest and enjoy her life.


She said she have all the right to choose what's best for her.


She can decide whom to marry or not and I can't put pressure on her to marry me.


She also told me that she don't want to be part of me when I am struggling.


She will marry me only if I get settled in the next two year(bought a house and starts earnings well to manage both EMI and lifestyle)


If she decides to marry me she have to work maybe for one year which she clearly said no that she don't want to marry me as if things don't workout the way we think then she will end up cursing me for snatching her opportunity of marrying someone richer.

I asked her that I will try my best to give her best life but I need one year of support from her so that I can buy a house on EMI but she ends up breaking up.

(I was told it's due to the fact that his account is most likely not approved for international transactions.)

now i still have some time to use that code but i am pursuing Full time Course and can only give little attention later when lock down opens, this 2 week lock down is the only time i have to complete that program with good grades. since i have no other option i have to ask you guys for help, most of the Members of this sub are from upper middle class or Business owners who are frequently doing these kind of transactions so i just need your help in completing the payment. the amount is less than $5 (after application of code) and i will directly transfer the same amount to your account via UPI so privacy will not be an issue for those who will do payment for me.

if you are willing to help, please post here or PM me, i will send you necessary details via PM. i have no other option, so if you are free, please help me.

3929,"Why does India have such a high fatality rate in Covid-19 cases?
Edit:

Apparently I'm wrong. That's not how the fatality rate is calculated. 

>In epidemiology, a case fatality rate (CFR) ‚Äî sometimes called case fatality risk ‚Äî is the proportion of deaths from a certain disease compared to the total number of people diagnosed with the disease for a certain period of time

For such a rapidly spreading disease CFR doesn't show us a good enough picture because most of the people who have diagnosed still haven't completed their course yet. 

So, It seems we'll know the actual fatality rate only after the pandemic is over.


|Country|Total Recovered|Total Deaths|Fatality Rate(%)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|
|S. Korea|6,776|200|2.86|
|Germany|36,081|2,096|5.4|
|Iran|27,039|3,993|12.8|
|Italy|24,392|17,127|41.25|
|India|468|164|25.6|
|USA|21,815|12,988|37.3|


The high fatality rate of Italy can be attributed to the high number of cases but in India, the currently there aren't many cases yet we have such a high fatality rate. 

Can anyone explain this?

4036,"Finance Basics ‚Äì Share Market,Mutual fund, InsuranceLets learn something being at home. Any doubts you can message me.

If you are earning , you should know where to put your money , where people put money .

The real thing now is ‚Äì why we need to invest. It‚Äôs because the value of everything, we buy, like food,clothes and land. Everything is rising and the one thing that is falling is, the value of money . It always fall and it will be same. That‚Äôs called inflation.

So, if you are just keeping money with you , it should be declining around 6 percent every year.

So, people invest, because all investment products ,if you see from past years are rising, anything like fixed deposit, gold ,mutual fund and share market.

We will discuss about share market, mutual fund and insurance below:

1.¬†Share Market¬†‚Äì
I just did a google search of a company called reliance , so it showed me the share price of it .

Just search in google : reliance share price

At that time of my search it showed 1353 is per share value. Market cap as you see in  is 8.58Trillion . So, if you divide mkt cap/value per share .You will know total how many shares are there. Share means a part of company. So, a company might be keep 51% share and giving the rest to public to buy, means they are selling ownership of company part to get money. So, that they can use that money may be to clear debt or to expand.

Company list these share in NSE/BSE (National Stock Exchange/Bombay Stock Exchange) .They offer it to people at a lesser price first known as IPO (Initial public Offering) . So, that you can subscribe for it through your broker, and the allotment is done.

The broker is register with NSE/BSE and you have to open a account with broker to buy or sell share. You can buy IPO or buy already listed share, so exchange allow to sell and buy share among individual, and shares are being hold in demat account. Demat account is basically a deposit account of share like you have bank account for money. You can open demat account with broker. And trading will be simple, there will be a buy button to buy and sell button to sell.

For example zerodha, they are India‚Äôs largest share broker -




They are discount brokers that means they charge very less on trading like least in india. 



2. Mutual Fund :
Mutual fund is about giving someone money and rights to manage your funds. So, they have different varities of funds and you can chose which one and which fund manager you would like to give money to.

They are of different types:

i. Equity Mutual fund:

Equity mutual fund buy shares , and are of different types like one investing in only small cap shares, one in large and other in mix of both.
There are index funds too, index means a instrument that sums up share market growth/decline. For example top 50 shares index is called as Nifty 50.
A index fund just track nifty 50, there is no such requirement of fund managers.

If someone managing fund with much harder effort, they charge more money for that, that‚Äôs called expense ratio. So, in nifty fund the expense ratio will be lowest.

ii. Debt fund:
Debt fund doesnot directly invest in shares , they invest in Government bonds , and company schemes, FD. So, this can be the safest.

iii. There are Hybrid funds. ,means a mix of both funds.

For a suggestion, there are rating agency, like Morning star , you can just invest in 5 star rated funds.

There are various direct mutual fund apps now available and they charge less expense ratio. Like the above link i provided for zerodha in share market section. Once you open account there, you use their¬†coin.zerodha.com¬†to trade mutual funds. It‚Äôs free and direct.
You can sign up and use the app to buy. It‚Äôs easy.

You may have heard about terms like lumpsum and SIP. Lumpsum is basically investing a amount at once. SIP means investing it on montly basis. So, what SIP does is ,it averages out your investment . It means, if on april , you bought at high price in may ,market fell and you still bought it by SIP ,so now your buy price is the average of both.



3.¬†Insurance¬†:
Insurance means transfer of risk to other . So,there are companies that you transfer risk, of your vehicle,health ,life basically financially.Accordingly it is classified into two types:

i. General insurance
General insurance relates to bike ,cars,etc. It is also of different types like

First party ‚Äì first party means where both the insured person and the one with whom you had accident ,will be paid

Third party means only the one whom you had accident will be paid
These are compulsory in india.

ii. Life insurance

Life insurance are health insurance, term insurance, endowment plans .etc.

a. Health Insurance:
Health insurance means it covers your hospital expenses ,like you got some disease and the bill amount to lakhs of rupees ,it could drain out all your investment right. So if you have a health insurance,the company covers your expense

b. Term Insurance:
Term insurance means like you are the only earning member of your family ,after you die no one is there to support you . So, if you are giving a premium of 6000 per year ,after you die ,family will get a lumpsum of 60 lakh , its like that‚Ä¶

But only death benefit, else you won‚Äôt get money.

c. Endowment Plans:

If you are giving 50000 premium for 5 years here and getting 5 lakh after some 10 years, or depends on market.

Or if you die your nominee gets 5 lakh . Endowment for an example is like this.

You get maturity benefit and death benefit too, but premiums are high.

Basically, I believe you dont need endowment better invest in mutual fund and take term insurance , since endowment have huge charges . Health insurance is a must though.",1586368616.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,34,76

4039,"Things government should do to take advantage of the lockdown situationI wonder what the various departments of the government at the center, the states and the municipalities are doing to take advantage of this unfortunate but once in a lifetime opportunity during this lockdown. It certainly is a huge crisis but it also comes with a few opportunities which the various government departments that are not busy with COVID-19 can handle like the PWD, Roads and Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation, etc.

I think it would be a great time to fix infrastructure in most cities, in buildings that are heavily used throughout the day, in bridges and roads that require critical maintenance and also in heritage sites which are overwhelmed with visitors but need maintenance. The governments should utilize this opportunity to hire laborers and provide them with food and accommodation along with generous rates for the work and ensure proper safety from the corona crisis.

This way when the cities are back up and running, much of those infrastructure projects that forces roads to be closed either totally or partially could be avoided and a lot of the traffic caused by jams can also be avoided.

Some of these activities might be already happening but they did not come to my notice yet.",1586364486.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,14,15

4072,"Are people(especially men) really okay with with their partner's past history(boyfriends, sexual)? or are they just afraid of being labelled backward/prudish, or just want to fit in(with liberals/pseudo-liberals)?Note: I am not saying this should apply to only women. same applies to men too (you can reverse the genders in below). it is not right that women need not worry about their husbands past(they can and should)

A little background: I am a bit on the introverted spectrum, I live in a little bubble(not much contact/info on what goes around, especially people's lives or how the trends are currently). My parents are searching for brides(arranged marriage, I am now 29). I always thought its the guys(not all, but most) are pigs and would be ready to drop their pants without any serious commitments. And, girls like to keep their honor(even - sex only after marriage or serious commitment). I understand that this is how our parents were and may not be the case currently, but still I thought at least a good number of girls will never go into casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved). Even if they did have, I thought it would be to just get a validation among peers(and would never get into intimacy). But, wow!, was I totally wrong. It appears most of the girls (especially in metros) definetely would have had at least one or two boyfriends(with no serious commitment in mind and ready/wanting to have intimacy).

**I came to this conclusion after doing a little research(got curious and paranoid too), asked around very few people I know(men and women, and even the homely, next door girl types, or are they!?) and read articles, and answers from Quora. To my surprise not even single one wanted to oppose this or think it is wrong, i.e it is okay to have casual relatiionships/boyfriends(with intimacy involved) and no need to wait for someone special without getting intimate or savor the joy of being your partner's first and last(and being your partner's first and last)**, they all nodded that it is admirable and great, but didnt give it much importance, said - you shouldnt be like that(and that I shouldnt expect so, not in a - ""hey, its not practical man"" way, but in a ""you just cant"" way). When asked if I can at least ask the girl upfront(in a polite, non-condescending/non-judgemental way), the reply always was - no, you cant ask that, your partner's past is none of your concern.

I still can understand above from their point of view, its your life, who am I to judge how should one live. But when I asked would you not feel bad/hurt after learning your wife's/husband's past(especially sexual) after marriage(most of these are married recently, I could have at least understood if it was a long marriage and they are an aged couple and they bonded very much enough to get past this), the reply always was - no it does not bother me, even the ones that didnt have any/much past(especially men!!, thats a surprise). I for one cannot understand this. **It appears I am the only one who is unable to digest the fact that the person I am going to share my life with did things with someone else. I am not saying it is end of the world, but at least it appears a big deal to me, not something I can just forget/get-past-it easily.**

**My questions are -**

1. Am I the only who cant digest/is-very-much-uncomfortable-with my wouldbe's past? I am okay if that is really the case(not all are made different, or maybe I didnt evolve much according to current standards/ways. no pun intended, i mean it, it may very well be true)
2. If I am not the only one, i.e many are like me too, why are they saying so? are they afraid of being labelled backward/prudish?
3. or, am I just plain wrong?, i.e grass is indeed greener, its just that I am getting info from wrong sources or small demographic and I am just being paranoid?
4. Why are these people supporting this? they just dont like the idea(or have no interest in or felt does not make sense at all)?, or just want to make most out of life(i.e enjoy as much as you can before marriage)?. no judgement here, if thats how they want to live, fine they can live it that way, just trying to understand the reality/truth.

Please dont label me as backward/prudish, I am actually very open minded(to some extent, apparently :) ) and I believe in liberal values(free spech, equality, questioning things rather than just blindly believing etc..). and I am not mysogynist either. Just because someone is male, he shouldnt think he is better or deserve things than females(my case still applies if you reverse the genders). and its not just about gender, it applies to race/intellectuality/status etc.. too (it is a horrible thing for me to descriminate on these basis).

And sorry for the long post..just felt more details might help understand better.

&#x200B;

PS:

By intimacy i mean getting physical. first base - no surprise there, expected, but even second/third base and even home run in most cases.

And I am not saying all are like that, but to me it appears majority are like that, but then again I might be wrong(I am happy to stand corrected)

Its not because I wanted to get any action but couldnt(due to inability or some other factors), so I dont want my partner to have what I couldn't. That would only makes me a hypocrite. (I am not a stud nor attractive, I didnt get many encounters, just had two(or maybe not!?), got tempted, but refrained, not even because of morals, but thought it would be unfair with the expectations I have on my partner)

And no judgement at all, I practice live and let live(if it sounded so, I didnt mean it, i am happy to correct it). I just wanted to understand what the reality/truth is.",1586354778.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,105,7

4093,"[P] How to deal with parents who support extreme government authoritarianism?My dad seems to be going down this path of extreme authoritarianism. He gets most of his news from Republic TV and is a heavy Modi/BJP supporter. Recently, with the Jamat news, we had a heated discussion where he actually suggested that he is in support of killing the offenders without a fair trial because some of them refused to give themselves up for COVID-19 testing. I obviously think that those who evade authorities are offenders and should be punished, but I also think that nobody has the right to unilaterally take someone else's life. Put them in a prison for the rest of their lives ffs, not kill them.

My dad says they'll make this a communal affair (as if he doesn't have deep-seated contempt for Muslims), so the entire judicial system should be done away with. He believes that the authorities should have all the rights without any checks. I tried to reason with him about why this is a slippery slip that leads to Nazism 2.0 or a suppressed population like in China, but he believes that China is a very ruthlessly efficient system that is for the greater good (!!!).

He also believes that the human rights violations against Uyghurs in China is acceptable (!!!) because, and I quote, ""they were trying to convert the Chinese to Islam,"" even though he has no evidence of that. Even if he did have strong evidence of something like that, and even if it was lawfully illegal somehow, I said that we still need a judicial system to rule it as unlawful. Does our judicial system have flaws? Of course, and I agree with my dad on that point, but instead of improving it to be faster and fairer, why remove it altogether and give absolute power to an already corrupt system?

I'm currently studying abroad in a Western country where I'm obviously a minority, so I naturally asked him if he'd support such authoritarianism if injustice was done to me, his son. I asked him if he'd be okay with a system that leaves me with no legal recourse for discrimination against a Hindu minority (me), but he basically evaded that question.

Authoritarianism works until it doesn't. Authoritarianism is cool as long as you agree with the people in power, but power corrupts and you soon have a system of oppression. Authoritarianism is okay as long as it doesn't affect you or your family.

How do I explain this to him? I'm considering never discussing politics with him for I adore and respect my dad and I'd hate to see our strong relationship degrade even a bit because of these things. FML.",1586279232.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,28,68

4110,"Situation of Indian mediaI am starting to wonder the condition in which the Indian media is right now. With the kind of venom that they spew on an everyday basis, I wonder why they do it. 

I can think of only two possible scenarios of why they could do it.

1. The media has completely sold itself and its morals down the drains and is doing it for money and the media channel owners want to become rich.

2. The media has done something wrong that the current government has caught a hold of. Due to which, the government is forcing them to do it in order to avoid prison.

My inclination is more towards the second possibility since I think people are still humans in the end and no one would actively do what the Indian media is doing.

Apparently this was a burnol moment for a lot of Bhakts and the IT Cell and a Twitter hash #WelosthopeBSY began to trend early this morning bashing the CM and asking him to step down. Crazy stuff, but a few hours later a few sane individuals realised this and started trending #WeStandWithBSY.

This is in sharp contrast to a few younger leaders who are out for blood and who will do anything and everything to impress the folks up north.

Hey, guys.

I don't know which is the right subreddit to post it in, this was the closest to home so I decided to post this question here:

There's this confessions page on Instagram for my college, that page has basically become a breeding ground for a lot of bullying, and hate confessions that is seriously affecting people that I know. (The confessions are made through anonymous Google forms that are then posted in the Instagram page)

What I want to know is- is it possible to know the identity of the confessor if we file a case against the page on grounds of cyberbullying?

Thank you.

I am not against any kind medical practice as long as it is scientifically proven and works the way it is supposed to. I am looking for any official or reliable source that states that this medicine improves immunity ?

Questions:

\#1: A) Are they trying to cure all infected people of Coronavirus so there is no more ill person or B) they are trying to infect everyone at a slow rate so that no more person is left to infect?

\#2: If the answer to #1 is ""A"", is it even possible, considering it's increasing day by day?

\#3: If the answer to #1 is ""B"", why we introduced lockdown so soon. I think it would have made more sense to introduce lockdown when there were at least 25K patients all over India. Now we have to wait for more time to reach the peak, which means more days of lockdown.

\#4: If the answer is not either ""A"" or ""B"",  then C) what is our current strategy? D) How it will end the Coronavirus? E) Does it require same level of lockdown throughout the country?

4267,"Is the most pathetic thing about Hindu-Nationalists their subservience to White-Supremacists?If you go onto right wing social media circles you find countless conspiracy theories that are pretty much copy/pasted from cesspools like Stormfront or /Pol/, many about how the ‚ÄúSoros‚Äù funded left wing media is unfairly critical of right-wing ideologies or how the mere existence ‚ÄúRadical Islamic terrorism‚Äù is justification enough to impose indiscriminate violence against Muslims. 

Under any one of Donald Trumps tweets you will find hoards of Indians venerating him and congratulating him for his policies against Muslims or celebrating his friendship with Modi. 

And the wave of anti-Chinese bigotry, perpetrated by racist whites in response to the coronavirus, has swept up India in such a frenzy that even Indian North-easterners are not safe from attacks and harassment due to having oriental features. 

There is such a innate desire for Hindu-nationalists to make sure that they are on the same side of every issue as white supremacists as both of them see their own community as being inherently better than the rest and therefore united in their contempt for the rest.

But the one key difference between the two groups is all of this ethno-nationalist bravado projected by the Indian government and its Hindu-nationalist supporters falls to the wayside when Donald Trump threatens retaliation against India for putting its own self interest before that of the white supremacists.

It‚Äôs almost as if they have accepted their status as being above the Chinese, the Muslims, etc but subconsciously they have accepted the rule of the white man over them. 

It‚Äôs not a surprise that over the course of his tenure, as India tries to contort and bend to appease him, Donald Trump treats India with almost a sense of restrained contempt.

While the barrage of pettiness and hate, that is reserved for countries like Bangladesh, Malaysia, Turkey and others in India‚Äôs more immediate neighborhood, is released the moment any of them dare to say something slightly critical of India, somehow this strong and aggressive Hindu-nationalist government almost always just cowers down to the US and complies accordingly to all their threats and requests.

A Red pill for all the intolerant,bigoted Indians who are insidiously targeting religious minority directly and indirectly against the secular spirit of our constitution.

The language used in the post mentioned in one of the prominent subreddit relating to India is filled with deceitful, fraudulent, fictitious material which can be valued as malicious subjective personal opinion, having full slandering and negligible facts.

The accusations are based on the rumours circulating on WhatsApp. This itself can prove no credibility and unreliability of source of the post.Most of the viral videos where Muslims doing all criminal activities are have been proved fictitious, google and you will get. Read twitter and trust worthy newspapers. No doubts some of fringe elements among Muslims have misbehaved but is the correct deduction for the general Muslims? Are you that irrational and stupid?Sticking to the COVID-19 disease, and the alleged spread of corona virus by ""Muslims"" in India. This is a fact that a group of people have attended a religious congregation which is related to propagation Islamic religion in India, totally allowed under Art. 25 of our Constitution for all religions. The fact,approved and proven by the Govt. that this congregation has lead to become one of the instrumental factors in spread of the virus. This fact is not disputed, and its true. It a setback to India's fight against the virus. These people should co-operate with medical fraternity and district administration now. Lesson learned.

Now, Are you gonna now count, the number of positive COVID-19 cases on basis of religion? Is that the society we want to live in? and guess what, Muslims wont be leading the figures.

But the provocatory language and the malafide intent, to show superiority over the least educated, poorest community in India. Does one get a hard on from squishing the weak? Is that one's upbringing. Does this make the speaker any better than the weak? if Yes, Guess what, YOU are insecure and emotionally weaker.

Is this the fraternity and unity of our country? Read the preamble of our Constitution.

Does anyone think, by blaming and insulting, making derogatory comments against Muslim community makes you any better?

Should not we as egalitarians support, help, inform and educate the backward community? Will witch hunting and blood-lust do any good?

Are you doing any help by forwarding the hateful messages on social media? This is to all the hate monger irrespective of your religion.

By equating a religion to a cult, such immature analogy will make all religion a cult. The difference between a religion and cult is what society thinks is unusual. It is left to the society to decide, not by majoritarianism. Sorry, sheer number cannot decide what is correct and not correct.

On one hand lecturing canny advice and other hand, mischievously mockery of stereotypical physical attributed of an Muslim. Be specific, dont try to fool the redditors here by your veil of ""advice"". We are smarter than that. The post's colourable rant exhorts hate and poison. Grow a pair of balls to say it straight.

I believe in our public servants, medical fraternity, and the Indians, as well as the world. Humanity have been tested and we have survived, we have lost and will lose our fellow dear humans.

4289,"Do you think India should revoke lockdown on April 14 ?Personally, I believe that our corona virus cases would increase exponentially after April 14 if lockdown is revoked.

* India‚Äôs current total infected cases is 4,900 and we are testing about 12,000 people per day. Which I think is nowhere near enough. 

* United States had around 5000 cases before March 20 and they were testing around 50,000 per day during that time, they increased it to about 1,10,000 testing per day on March 25 and their corona virus cases started exploding.

Even if we‚Äôre on lockdown, plenty of incidents happened recently that might have caused mass community spreading like the Nizamuddin Dargah, hundreds of people celebrating Ram Navmi despite lockdown, Dharavi slum incident, then those mass-migrations just after lockdown, and on April 5 too, almost everywhere (from big cities to small towns) people started celebrating like it‚Äôs Diwali... So, if these incidents caused tons of new cases, then they‚Äôd mostly like show symptoms after lockdown is over, and it‚Äôd started a disastrous community spreading after lockdown. 

Also if we continue with these very low rates of testings, we‚Äôll never be able to figure out the peak of the curve. May sources also claimed India will peak the epidemic around April first week, which is far from truth. But according to speculations from artificial intelligence, India will peak during June-July..",1586272223.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,33,64

Advocate Prashant Bhushan tells the Court that lakhs of migrant workers are placed in shelter homes and this will make Social Distancing difficult; adds that if one person contracts the virus, it puts everyone in the shelter home at risk. ""They should be allowed to go home""

Bhushan says wages should be released because the migrant workers rely on wages for their meals. CJI SA Bobde asks why wages are required when meals are being provided by the govt. Bhushan points out meals given in shelter homes; not all migrant workers are in shelters

Bhushan adds that workers also need money to send it back home to their families that rely on this money. SG Tushar Mehta says that the government is on top of the situation and looking into all the complaints received; the helpline set up is being monitored constantly

CJI Bobde asks how can it be said that the government is not doing much without looking at the status report filed by the Centre. Bhushan says the orders passed by the govt concern provision of food in shelters and landlords not charging rent; says they are unimplementable

CJI Bobde says Court not inclined to interfere with the Government's decisions for the coming few days; says Court cannot take a getter policy decision at this stage.

Supreme Court to hear the matter again on Monday, April 13. Prashant Bhushan given time till then to peruse the status report filed by the Centre on the issue of migrant workers.

Property ads on a billboard in the outskirts of Pune will feature a Caucasian couple with their children & dog(s).

Internet Service Providers in Mumbai will feature a light skinned African woman with a regulation sized afro in a business formal outfit, posing with a folder and flashing a million dollar smile & a thumbs up.

Nationalized banks's car loan advertisement will have a white guy in a European sedan.

A tiny 3 seater men's hair saloon which has a headshot Zayn Malik from 2013 posing with a purple suit, in Hyderabad. An absolutely random white model with a blonde hairstyle from 2079 stares at you on the other side of the flex board.

IT companies will have their email headers, policy mails, announcements feature a group of well manicured, well groomed ""diverse"" young executives all huddled in a glass conference room looking at an older white explaining some random shit on a white presentation board.

An electronics store in Ahmedabad with a saucy looking brunette, distinctly European woman in a red top and a grey skirt talking on her mobile phone. 

A cute white kid with beach blonde hair in oversized glasses and a book in his hand - used for advertising a new school in Ulhasnagar - and some fancy title about aspiring to be a interplanetary dietician.

Even pet stores will have a button nosed, blonde girl with two ponytail running behind a golden retriever in their flex board.

And how can we forget the tuition classes \ computer class adverts & pamphlets & brochures which have the whole high school stereotype clique posing with bags & large books - one girl in glasses, a white guy in a green tee shirt, the athletic looking jock who's almost always African, an adorable Asian girl in a chic jacket - among others.

Pubs, Hotels, Cafes & Restaurants are almost always the worst offenders with their Blond-Guy-and-Blond-Girl-partying-with-green-disco-lights-in-the-back; one token black guy with a metallic coloured shirt grooving; black girl sipping a coffee in front of a laptop, kid eating a hamburger imagery rehashed across the damn length & breadth of the country.

It took years before even our airports started featuring explicitly Indian models (but in OTT traditional, regional outfits) for general directions & imagery. And banks too.

And even in this - we don't leave behind our inherent racism - light skinned African men & women are cool - but that's the extreme end of our diversity. No overtly Muslim women wearing headscarves \ hijabs, no men with skull caps at all. 

Beards are always like a hipster's from Milwaukee or a Swedish business man's - but never like Rajdeep or Salim. 

Even the banyan advertisements feature our Bollywood stars posing with Bavarian looking models in an MS Paint gradient metallic blue \ grey background.

i understand we thrive with the free use material & basic Google search stock images - but why are we still not using Indian models & faces to sell Indian products.

Dark skinned Indians, East Indians are never even ***considered*** for representation - let alone headline these ad campaigns.

4394,"Extensive testing is an insurance to avoid lockdownSingapore just had a spike of 120 cases yesterday because of a couple of dormitories. It seems like a small spark can cause a fire.

One of the main tools to resume partial economy for any country after the lockdown is aggressive testing and tracing until there is a treatment or vaccine. Several people think scaling up testing is not necessary which makes me sad. I am going to make an insurance-like case for that taking India as a case.

Some back of the envelope calculation:

Cost of a test: upto 60$ (in India)
Doing 500,000 tests per day for 100 days would cost $3 billion.

This sounds like a lot... until we look at the cost of lockdown which is ~ $120 billion for 3 weeks. So, basically with the cost of a single day of lockdown we should be able to test 500,000 people everyday for 200 days. And there seems to be reasonable confidence in science community that we may have a safe and effective drug for treatment by then.

There can be different strategies for how we will pick people for the 500k tests per day and that's a later discussion. I am more concerned about getting extensive test coverage so we can detect outbreaks early and do a much finer grained lockdown than a blunt country-wide lockdown. Basically, pay a small cost to avoid another lockdown in the future.

PS1: Note that the cost of test will likely go down significantly (say an order of magnitude) if we scale up.

PS: I would also go further and say that we should make all international passengers who arrive get this done a few days after arrival (and make them pay for it)",1586250095.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,4,16

4403,"CSE students, please helpHey there. I am just getting mad to find a good college. The story goes like this:

Till class 8, I was good in studies. Then the first smartphone came into my house. My interest shifted to it. How android works, installing custom ROMs and all that stuff. Ruined class 9th. Back to track in class 10th. 89% in boards. Then in the meantime, I was interested in App Dev. At the end of 10th, I started learning some languages, but with no advice, I started with python for app dev. Studied KIVI lib but nothing useful in app dev. 

Then we were being taught C++ in school. So I started learning Android Studio with Kotlin. Developed some small apps like calc and some other. Also started Youtubing. Then after exploring the field, I was all into AI/ML. I just started learning Pandas and Numpy.  Results: Class 11th ruined. But this was not alone. I joined a bad institute, wasted my money and left(long story). So I stopped everything

Class 12th again back on track. Just gave my 12th examination(PCM, CS)..expecting 85-90%. But the thing is, it doesn't matter at all.

I gave JEE Mains first attempt(without studying). Got 75 percentile. The thing was I never knew there would be so much chaos for colleges. I don't want to take a drop, because I don't think I  can focus on preparing for entrances. I mean it has been one year, staying away from what I love. Also, my parents don't want to.

&#x200B;

So present scenario: 

Not filling JEE form for 2nd attempt is my big mistake. Registered for BITSAT. The problem is the 11th course. I am trying to do it, but it is like messing up my brain with so much to remember in one month. There are other entrances(COMEDK, VITEE) as well but all expensive private universities. There are good ones though, but my parents aren't satisfied with filling expensive forms CONSIDERING I am not even prepared. And it's not wrong. Even I don't have confidence in myself that I would clear one.

Any suggestion is highly appreciated.",1586263803.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,4

Crabby explosive personalities, rude, toxic etc

Many say the Indian character is angry but I think it's just angst that stems from chronic dissatisfaction and a determination to be miserable and House is pretty much the same but with a dry sense of humour

4604,"Rant : The WhatsApp Admin thingFirst of all, I may be terribly wrong in many things and I will gladly accept criticism.

The WhatsApp Admin arrest thing feels like the worst case of technological illiteracy. 

Almost a year ago, someone I know made a simple group for discussing before exams. Everyone used their contacts and added people from everywhere and it was really great and helpful. Fast forward to a night before exam, everyone was stressed and the group was silent since everyone was busy studying. In these dark times, the guys who are the most Vella are awake.

One of the guys shared a meme about a Historical Figure and some guys got butthurt as it affected their class or something, shared group link with 20 others, abused the shit out of that guy and it went on and on. 

The Admin had his phone shut due to highly obvious reasons, came online 3 hours later and removed those new people,  and the guy who shared the meme who was sorry about it, told everyone that this group ain't for this, and deleted it as well but it was too late.

The People had some ties up and shared screenshot with the police. They got their hands on the person who shared the meme and then the admin who has absolutely no part in this at all. And a huge police case with tons of cash.

Looking at the current situation every group is like the Admin should be responsible for what happens on group and what not. I heard of cases where group admins are arrested, like 20 of them as well, just because some dumb forward was on their group.

**Why exactly is this dumb?**

WhatsApp does not provide any rights to a Group Admin. Apart from Adding and Removing people. 

When a person is removed they can still see the group members and the chats after they are deleted.

A person who is deleted can still have group link and use it to add others untill it's revoked

A Group can have around 40 Admins from any place in India or other. So according to the law or whatever is said, all of those 40 Admins can be held accountable.

Admins are usually a joke in WhatsApp groups. Barely anyone actually respects them.


These issues are really solved in Discord and Telegram where there are very real rights provided to a Moderator or an Admin. And I think even Facebook Group Admins have more rights but this is clearly dumb. I have even heard that some people purposely send messages which can be harmful for a Group or its Admin so that they would be held accountable, while some have even sent messages, and left the group to mentally hurt the Admin. 


And I guess that's the rant. There is no real solution to it, even though a better app exists, no one's going to switch to it be ause some *WhatsApp Forwards* do a fantastic job of *informing people* that these Apps are by some Rival Countries or dumb shit like that.",1586253379.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,33

I am sure a lot of you must have heard about/read this book. The books talks about how the world is becoming a better place, but we may not be seeing it. True, there is still a lot of bad things happening, but the big picture is gradually getting better.

In the context of India, there are a few parameters I considered that show the growth of the society - 

1. Population - Contrary to the popular belief, our population growth has in fact slowed down to almost half it growth rate from previous years.
2. Fertility Rate - Our average fertility rate is lower than the world average! We started from \~6 children per woman after independence and have gone down to \~2.1. The world average is 2.4.
3. Life expectancy - Our life expectancy is improving at a rate almost 2x the world average.
4. Secondary school enrolment for girls - Compared to the world average growth of 1.7%, India's rate of enrolment has been increasing at \~3.5x of that for the last 20 years!

The fundraiser is seeking donations not from everyday individuals but from tech giants and rich philanthropists. They have raised $ 35 million within a week.

When she was announcing the lineup of artists hosting the fundraiser, she also said Priyanka Chopra ans SRK would be a part of it. 

Its kinda sad on two levels : --

1) Why didnt SRK / Priyanka do something like this for Indian families affected by COVID-19

2) Why didnt Bolloywood or any Indian media think of organising some fundraiser like this where they would make calls to prominent philanthropists and Indian tech companies asking for donations.

Finally, its also sad that all donation drives in India seem to be prying on the everyday middle class citizen. For example : PM Cared Fund, the OLA driver salary fundraiser. Its kinda pathetic really..

That‚Äôs a different story related to internalised homophobia and bearing extreme shame inside. I used to constantly contemplate taking myself off this earth (not that I still don‚Äôt think about it)

My parents are hoping that I might come around and say yes to the Indian societal acceptance of marriage. I am honestly exhausted putting up with my mum. We argue sometimes but more than that I feel MASSIVE guilt. Have I taken their happiness from them? Have I caused shame to my family for what I am? What if people start asking questions when my brother is getting married and me being the elder one is still unmarried? Should I just give up on life where I could be myself and just submit to them and spend my life in a loveless and sexless marriage?

All these questions have been haunting me for the last ten years! I never had any friend that I could trust to tell them that I have been considering suicide for the past year or so, that I have been exhausted of living with myself and the world around me that doesn‚Äôt help. I have all of these thoughts inside that are eating me up alive and I feel that hell is inside me.

I feel so alone and dejected in life. All I have ever done in these twenty years is to suck it up all in and never show my vulnerability. All my life I adapted to not feel anything and do everything like I have been told. I get high everyday to drown the sorrow that nobody loves me. I have never had a boyfriend or felt the butterflies! 

Honestly I thought I could move out of the country but that option is looking bleak. I don‚Äôt have enough money saved for the move and the depression is getting stronger that I am losing the will to do anything to achieve my dream. There is inherently something wrong with me and I can‚Äôt put my finger on it. Travelling is all I wanted to do. But all I can think of is how fucking ugly I am with absolutely no skills to boast for. Like being a useless log that lies in bed all day. 

If this is all there is I would rather pull the trigger soon after I make enough money to support my parents after I am gone. I have nothing to look forward to, life‚Äôs a drag and I don‚Äôt want to continue the chain of bringing more lives into this ruthless world.

Sorry for the long rant. I don‚Äôt have enough avenues to vent out. I am so sorry, existence is a searing pain. I want to get done. I feel fucking awful.",1586211330.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,20,51

Not enough PPEs, not adequate testing.
We are testing 27 per million
Compared to 67 power million in Pakistan.
Korea is testing more than 7000 per million.

Regarding the Tableeghi jamaat incident in Delhi, few points

1. The gathering happened much before the lockdown was announced
2. Once the lockdown was announced the gathering wanted to disperse and asked the sdm for vehicle passes. The sdm did not respond.
3. Foreign visitors allowed into the gathering without proper checks. They were the source of infection.
4. Once infected people were found in the gathering why were they all not quarantined by the administration. Why were they allowed to return to their own places before 2 weeks?

After the above incident, the ruling politicians and there IT cell have worked very hard to create the narrative that Muslims are the reason for the spread of corona cases in India. The total lack of preparedness from the government is being glossed over.

Old and out-of-context videos are being shared to demonize the Muslim community. https://altnews.in is filled with so many examples where the facts have been unearthed behind fake videos on WhatsApp and Facebook.

The above was for context

I made a comment in my old friends WhatsApp group that with the April 5, 9 p.m. details a Jalao ""initiative"", corona would surely be gone. With sarcasm.

The response that I got had enough proof that my well educated friends had totally fallen for fake news and truly hated the Muslim community from their gut. A Muslim man licking fruits to spread corona. A Muslim man spitting on police. All of these have been debunked on detail on alt news. But the recipients of these fake videos totally believe them. For them opIndia, WhatsApp and Facebook are like the gospel.

The amount of poison they spewed was phenomenal. When I engaged with fact checks, the response that I got was

I'd rather worry about my future than think of fully utilising my data package for the day.

This was my experience with ""friends"" of twenty years.

How did we come to this?

A wise friend told me that if you want to remain friends on WhatsApp then better not to discuss religion and politics. Maybe he was right.

Maybe this fake news shitstorm has truly blinded well educated individuals, for whom bigotry has become second nature now.

I wonder if the govt are going to launch an initiative at some point that encourages people to report friends, relatives and family members who aren't getting with the programme. We are at such a fever pitch of rabid nationalism and slack-jawed groupthink that it would take rather little to nudge us into Stalinesque mistrust and treachery. It could begin with people in WhatsApp groups reporting someone at a \*.gov.in for sharing a dissenting article that they deem fake news, but in the process blacklisting the sharer in the govt's eyes. This could then snowball into folks being rewarded for doing their patriotic duty when they snitch on critics of the BJP or Hindutva, possibly by doxxing them or carrying out similar town square rituals of violation. What if acts like leaving your lights on when he-who-must-be-obeyed wants them turned off turn into social shibboleths that are meticulously recorded and met with systematic retribution ?

4804,"These Corona virus events are not the best way to judge Modi‚Äôs popularity. Hear me out.I have seen a lot of commentary online about how these taali banging and candlelight events show Modi‚Äôs unparalleled popularity and what it means for the future of our democracy. While it is true Modi is an extremely popular politician, I don‚Äôt think these events are the best way to measure it. Here is why:

* To begin with, most national leaders see a spike in their popularity when the country is facing a crisis. This is commonly known as [Rally 'round the flag effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rally_%27round_the_flag_effect). (For example, Trump, even after his colossal mismanagement in dealing with the Corona virus outbreak, has seen an increase in his approval ratings). Sadly, this makes the pandemic a good opportunity for populists and fascists to seize more power, and that should worry us. ([For Autocrats, and Others, Coronavirus Is a Chance to Grab Even More Power](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/world/europe/coronavirus-governments-power.html))

* Only a small percentage of people understand the semi-political nature of these events. For most people these were non-political events to fight Corona virus. Many people who might vote for other parties also took part in these events for a variety of reasons, including and not limited to love for the country (Rally 'round the flag effect), peer pressure, manufactured consent through media, boredom etc. 

* These events happened at a time when the entire country is under lockdown (something like this probably wouldn't be as successful as it was if there was no lockdown). People are locked in the house and glued to the TVs. Modi Govt used this situation to communicate and seek support for his events by non-stop media coverage. It didn‚Äôt matter which news channel you watched in the last few weeks, you couldn‚Äôt escape the marketing for these events. Dozens of popular film stars, sportspersons, religious leaders, etc were deployed to spread awareness and seek support for these ‚Äúnon-political‚Äù events. I doubt many of these celebrities will openly lend their support for Modi‚Äôs other openly political projects like CAA or NRC.

* Many news channels also portrayed the act of lighting the lamps as a prayer to the God to help fight the virus. Given how religious this country is and the situation we are in, the message was naturally persuasive for many people. **This is what really forced some in my family to light the lamps, not the message of solidarity or politics**. A few news outlets packaged yesterday‚Äôs event primarily as a prayer more than anything else and that worked.

* Opposition, whatever little is left, couldn‚Äôt openly oppose these events. The either unenthusiastically supported them or just kept quiet. That won‚Äôt necessarily be the case under normal circumstances.

* It is my assessment that the **devastating effects of the pandemic on the economy will have infinitely more impact on Modi's political future** then these marketing events. A lot of potential political damage to Modi on this would also depend on the performance of Congress as an opposition, and that‚Äôs a sign of worry given the state of the grand old party.

* Modi‚Äôs popularity is a by-product of a compromised media ecosystem. These PR stunts by Modi and the communalization of the outbreak proved that once again. So, in my view, **it‚Äôs the death of independent media that should worry us more than Modi‚Äôs popularity, as the latter stems from the former**. Sadly, I don‚Äôt see a solution for the media problem anytime soon. On the bright side, Modi‚Äôs popularity doesn‚Äôt automatically translate into victories in state elections for the party. We have seen that in the recent assembly elections where BJP lost despite major political events like the dilution of the Article 370 and the Ram Mandir verdict.

As the title says, has India ramped up its CodVid-19 testing yet, it seems like it has given the overnight exponential growth in the number of confirmed cases, but I would like the docs to weigh in and advise if India is PROACTIVELY testing a significant amount of potential carries NOW to help flatten the curve or are we just making an insignificant dent in the curve still. If not, why not? Is it the government's mishandling of this pandemic - lack of testing infra, kits or money?

4845,"Suggest me few courses or certifications, that I can do in next 2 months, before i join a B-school in IndiaHi guys/girls,

I am planning for an MBA from India in 2020. I have appeared for entrance exams and have received offer laters from few private b-schools and awaiting results of interview of IIMs. With this lockdown, I‚Äôm planning to utilise this two months for my maximum benefits, I want to do few Foundation courses and certifications that will help me in my MBA.   
I have started with Google Analytics for beginner, and I don‚Äôt know which all courses and certifications I should do.  I haven‚Äôt selected a specialisation so suggestions from marketing, fin, ops, and strategy are welcome. Though I‚Äôm inclined towards fin/strategy. Mostly looking for free or paid but not costly ( reason being, I do not want to huge money at this moment on the courses of the stream option I will not be selecting).

If you are an MBA, or studying in one of the b-schools, or are an aspirant just like me, then, Could you please suggest me few certification courses that you think are must-have, or good to have??

4908,"Here's my side of the story as a small businessmanThis is going to be long. I would really appreciate it if you can read this fully. Thank you for your attention in advance. 

I'm not sure what to flair this post as. I'm on a throwaway account that I may or may not continue using and I just want to share my side of the story while I sit here in loneliness watching random videos on Youtube just to get my mind off of things. And with no sign of sleep at all.

>About me & my partners

I'm a late 20s guy who quit his job two years ago and went ahead and jumped into the Indian startup ecosystem to start my business. I'm also a college dropout by choice so I don't have a graduate degree but I really loved the business WE were running. Me along with two of the bestest friends were my partners and I feel responsible for them. One of them quit his safe cushy job when I messaged him at 2am in the morning with my idea and the other one trusted me enough to fund this whole machine. I'm extremely lucky to have these people in my life and I acknowledge that.

>Our Business - What we do

Our business isn't one of those apps or tech related business. We're more into the supply chain and making product sourcing and fulfillment for people in the ecommerce sphere easy. Think of it in a way that I'm sourcing and exporting products that my clients sell on their ecom sites. I loved this because this is something that solved a problem for my own hobby turning it into a full-fledged business and it was also helping me create a legit machine with a brand name that also helped me capture clients.

>How has the lockdown affected my business?

Being a new business we were ALMOST breakeven. Most of the money we were losing was because of bad decisions and mistakes but everyday we were losing less. Also had a bunch of profitable days and weeks which helped us not invest more from our own pockets into the business. We had created a cycle where the money that came in helped us with all the costs.

Me along with the partner who had invested money into the business were not taking out salaries (reason why I said almost breakeven) and I was making sure that the third partner got paid because he left his good job and to assure his family members - remember, we're all in our late 20s. We had also hired some help to help us in the office and with the vendors that we were dealing with. Basically the plan was to spend only when absolutely necessary and while doing it this way we also made sure that we had a life outside of work.

This worked smoothly with some hitches of course.

In January when I read about the first covid-19 case in India, I was scared. Things got bad real soon around the world. With every passing day I was worried more and more about what I was going to do in case our country went into a complete lockdown. I checked and tried to do some analysis in order to see if we can still work it if we do go into the lockdown.

But the fact of the matter is that my business heavily depends on vendors and shipping providers and the latter is out of my control and reach. The main part of this whole thing was shipping which I had taken so much pain to setup.

One thing I learned while doing all this is that there's a reason why India with such manpower and about mediocre infra in our industry isn't able to fulfill even a fraction of the demand. It's because the vendors are lazy. Even if you promise to pay them above the market rate, make payments on time and even help them financially to source the raw materials, they are not willing to work for it. And I'm not talking about overtime or anything.. Just their normal work cycle. They are not serious about it at all.

I had multiple vendors but only one of them worked properly and listened to me when there was an urgency in the order we were giving them. We had this second vendor who just wasn't serious about the work and we were giving them loads of work. Within a month I was their biggest client and they did work properly for the first two months but after that it all went to shit. I couldn't change my vendor because that's a long process of renegotiating and setting everything up which I couldn't do in my volumes which were high.

I wrote all this because when my city got the first few Covid-19 cases, I started urging them to get my work done as soon as possible. We were given assurances, promises, we paid in advance but it all went to shit because now I have an inventory of products that is ready to go but I cannot send them due to the state borders being closed. My shipping company is not able to function and all these need to be sent out of India.

I'm now in a sea of uncertainty where I have to pay my bills, pay my office rent, pay salaries with whatever I have in the business account right now.

>The finances

I'm not even worried about the money, I'm worried about the inventory I have, I'm worried about the payment disputes I need to deal with because these are all orders to be sent outside India. For every payment dispute I lose, I lose $15 extra. The money for the customer acquisition cost is already paid for. The money for the raw materials are to be paid and I'm refunding customers everyday. Losing that customer acquisition amount along with any margin that I might have earned.

>What do I mean exactly? 

Now, I'm all for Life>Money but as a small businessman who has been thinking, living, breathing his business all the time for months and years, I'm going insane. I'm having panic attacks, I don't know what I will do next. I used to have a plan for everything, now I don't. I'm not able to let this go and this pain is almost physical now. My head hurts all the time, I sleep for a few hours and when I wake up my eyes are still red and they feel as if they're burning.

I'm also sure that there are businesses out there that are into deeper shit than I am but that in my own opinion shouldn't be a comfort for me. I'm not sadistic.

I have no savings, my company is running out of money, there are people who need to be paid, employees to pay and a partner who invested with trust and is now seeing the money disappear into thin air daily - he's a kind soul and hasn't said a single word for it yet.

But I feel responsible and I'm not able to calm down. Anxiety is on its peak for me right now and I have no plans to save us from this.

I come to this sub daily and I actively participate in discussions and disses but I haven't seen anything about small business people here and just wanted to tell my side of the story.

I'm scared guys, I'm not even religious and can just hope that the govt. probably is thinking of exporters in this scenario to maybe help us in this situation.

I'm wishing you all good health and please stay inside.

The government is trying to generate funds through many methods (PM cares, MP salary cut , world Bank loan, etc..) How long can we go on like this? Are we going to run out of cash?

The main villain of this whole act is lurking shadows, the one that drives Modi to do these magnanimous gestures and the Bhakts going a step further.

The Villain is Social Media and its cheap/immediate Validation of People's Acts.

Modi is a wave on the Ocean of time, the one who is using the potential of this villain to the maximum. Who can stop the next person to emulate or even elevate Modi's Acts ?

I wake up today to see that a tire is punctured. No biggie, I'll change it. Guess what? The new tire also is leaking air. So, before the tire completely deflated, I take it to the nearby puncture shop. 


On the way there, the police stops me. Asks me if a puncture is important in this ""corona time"". Doesn't even bother listening to my reason. Says I'm lying, because what 19 year old follows rules. Tells me he's seen many ""kids"" like me. 


Then, instead of just fining me, he (they, actually), makes me pull out the RC from my car, gives me a fine (doesn't tell me how much, or what he is booking me on), and tells me that I will get a call soon to go pay the fine. 


Also tells me that the education my parents have given me is ""useless"".

Corona or Muslims? 

Looking at the news channels and online media,  picture is blur, 
are you sure we are fighting against corona? 

-Is this the time to do this kind of nonsense? 

-we do not have any important task at our hand other than this old Hindu/Muslim propaganda?

-Where is our focus! to demolish this pandemic or to create a new one?

See any media, Talibaghi talibaghi everywhere! 
they are the only ones who spreading corona today in our country? 

What happened is happened, take strict actions against accused and move on! there is plenty to cover!

Couple of days ago i went to our main sabjimandi and what I saw was horrible! it‚Äôs filled with 5000+ peoples rubbing shoulder to shoulders! many without a mask! I asked one vendor and he said It‚Äôs daily event! I returned back from the distance! It‚Äôs ticking timebomb! There are three police stations around, at 5 to 10 minutes distance from there!

police, officials, media can‚Äôt see what i saw? and I am sure you can see this kind of sites in many other cities too! So tell me what is more important right now, to whip about something happened or take actions against what will going to happen!

Hate is more deadly, more infectious then corona, Love and hate are very subjective, you love somebody today might faces hate from you tomorrow or someone you hate today will be became beloved later! It‚Äôs depend on Image! positive or negative in your mind! and today Our politicians and media trying hard to implement negative image in to our minds! Mohammad Rafi, A.r.rahman, Abdul kalam, we all love them and also respect them today despite their religion, we have starting to hate whom we don‚Äôt know anything about, never met never seen! so where this hate came from? 
Right now one answer-bad Media and who are behind it! 

Love and hate do not follow any boundaries, when this Muslim propaganda is over it can jump on you too! If in the future for any reason you are not theirs favorable then you are the deshadrohi no matter which religion or cast you belongs, think my friends!

We can and we will create vaccine for corona but nobody else can ever make vaccine for Hate, if it catches you then there is no end, there is only you who can make vaccine within your self to protect against most contagious and most deadly virus ‚ÄúThe Hate‚Äù.",1586156231.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,2

5053,"Are We Hypocrite Inherently?Okay. So I see myself amidst a society where people live a double life. One life is the personal one, and the other they think they and everyone around is supposed to live (but the fact that they don't live it and are ignorant of it). I'll give you some examples of it. 
1) In between these ""QUARANTIMES"", we see people on social media arguing about who is wrong and who is right for every step that govt takes, and therefore they split people into two groups (National and Anti-national). Instead of thinking about the notion of a simple idea like torching lights, they fight over and make jokes about the people who won't do it and to the extent of bullying them. They act as if they care so much about the nation that they won't let that person become anti-nationalist, change his thinking and be a help for the country. Mind it, it's all happening on the social media, but in the real-life you'll see the same set of people breaking the rules, throwing away garbage here and there, when asked about justifying their these acts lead to a "" kya fark padta hai"" attitude. Do they do this just because they want to show other people?
2) I am a student at a premier institute. Most of my classmates live a double life when it comes to academics. When there is an argument over why our education system is not productive, each and everyone will start suggesting how the institute doesn't provide excellent teaching, and profs are boring, etc. But when it comes to them, they won't give any second thought about playing games in the class, bunking them, even indulge in cheating almost every time if they are left unattended.

On the one hand, people pretend that they have very profound knowledge about who is wrong and what is to be done for the betterment of society, but when it comes to them, they themselves are the very first one to break the rules.",1586152364.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,12

Does anyone have, or can create a similar diagram for a mask?

**Most of our mothers are good at stitching**, if we give them the right resources and the diagram, we can actually crowdsource the masks and hand them over to the local groups, and they can further circulate it.

What we need:

1. The schematic diagram of the mask.
2. The materials needed to make it.

5073,"Quora is full of hate !!Quora used to be my favorite platform back in 2014, mainly because there was so much new to learn and only those people were answering who actually had knowledge regarding the topic ( Professors, Scientists, Military Historians )

Now, it's full of hate speech, low-quality answers and cringeworthy questions like - ""What are some destruction level 100 tweets"" or ""What are some badass tweets during Covid-19"". It's filled with young Indians who have zero knowledge about the topic but don't hesitate to write their senseless opinions and comment hate. 

What's worse is the fact that a lot of people are openly spreading religious hate and trying to influence others regarding their beliefs. There are many right and left wingers who blame each other with childish comments.  Civil debates are non-existent and right-wing always finds a chance to blame non-Hindus and Liberals in almost every problem. 

My personal experience : 1) A guy literally wrote an answer saying Italians are victims of Coronavirus because they are liberals. A commentor on same answer even wrote that Italians deserve the suffering because ""they are leftists"". Both of them were Indians.

2) Many questions criticizing the government are quickly reported. Then those who don't agree with government's stance are put down as ""secular liberals"". 

3) One guy literally posted tweets from BJP Trolls in his answer and called them 'epic burn' and 'badass'. 

4)  Multiple answers ""completely"" blaming Muslims for Coronavirus ( Tablighi Jamaat should be blamed 100% but not the whole religion )

5079,"Scientific temper vs FaithThe following is an excerpt from a 1988 article on ""How to do research, at the MIT AI Lab"" (Link to the full article given at the end of this post). The following excerpt is about how to read a research paper:

```
Read with a question in mind. ""How can I use this?"" ""Does this really do what the author claims?"" ""What if...?"" 
```

The above, is what scientific temper is all about. It gives us the option of questioning everyone and everything. This has been drilled into me and other researchers by our respective research advisers - to never accept anything until you can prove it to yourself, until you can convince yourself of the validity of the idea presented in a research paper. No matter how successful/popular the author of the paper is, no matter how well cited a paper is, don't trust the presented results until you can prove it to yourself - either by deriving the proof yourself or by writing the code, doing the experiments and reproducing the results yourself.

A scientific temper teaches you to question everyone - from your parents, then your teachers, to your Governments. 

The reason this is not easy, is because it requires you to have an ego big enough to say ""everything is wrong until I verify it"" and simultaneously a humility big enough to say ""I was wrong"" when a mistake is pointed out. 

In the political scenario, you have Governments and followers indulging in fear-mongering to keep people in tow. You see fake videos spreading hatred and phobia that are easily debunked. You see Governments telling you that there are terror elements that intend to destroy the country - while a simple database lookup will show that on average, annually, less than 60 people die from cross-border terrorism of all kinds in India. 

Option 1, is to blindly believe anything your Government says. Option 2, is to put a lot of effort into investigating it yourself. 

Option 1 is about having faith, akin to following a religion. Its about clapping and lighting candles, while having blind faith that everything will be alright, no questions asked. Its about mindlessly chanting ""All is Well"" as portrayed in that (ironically) idiotic movie.
This option, leads to a faith based Governance - do nothing, have faith in us. 

Option 2 is about seeking the truth for yourself by exploration and collecting your own data samples. Its about being constantly updated and asking, rather nagging them, with questions like ""when will a mass testing program begin?"". 
This option, leads to people-driven Governance where we hold the decision-making power at every step of the way and the government only holds tools to execute those decisions.

More power to you, me, everyone.

5162,"A Small RantI love how people can play the game of 'Simon says...', banging utensils, lighting diyas and who knows what next and assume that they have done their part and feel satisfied. The fact that they can attribute terms like solidarity, unity, improving morale and paying homage to the medical personnel is nothing more than spitting in the wound. 

So, I've seen a lot of people calling doctors as gods, heroes and saviours right? Now assume yourself in the shoes of a doctor, you are now working in a hospital where there's a shortage of PPE's, N95 masks etc. You are walking, with inadequate protection, among 100's of sick people who might potentially be infected. Everyday you're working 10-12 hour shifts, barely getting any rest, all while an uncertainty looms in the back of your head if you are even going to get through this pandemic alive. Then you see all these people doing all kinds of weird shit and cheering you on to walk in to that death trap again. How would you feel? 

If your idea of being a hero is to sacrifice themselves, then never call them that. See them as humans, humans just like you and me, humans with families, goals and aspirations, humans with a desire to live to see another day. If anything, heroes like them are meant to be protected, so that they can do their jobs, not sacrificed. 

Lighting diyas because you are bored of this lockdown? Hell yeah. Banging utensils because you wanted to have some fun? Hell yeah. But dont you dare mock the people battling in the frontlines, by justifying your shenanigans with meaningless words that fit your narrative. If you really have that uncontrollable itch to do something about this situation, either use your social media to demand for more testing, more protection gears for the hospitals or

The left and right both have forgotten their purpose of social welfare. One is ready to jump off a cliff because a certain person told them to whereas the other would also jump off the cliff just because he asked not to.

I don't think I can do anything to improve my country, my fellow citizens and my life. So I want to become like the donkey (Benjamin) from Animal Farm. He doesn't give a fuck whatever happens as long as he gets food and a place to sleep. Sure, there will be days when the food is scarce and the roof leaks but again, there will be days when there is plenty of food and luxury (hopefully). Because, I feel helpless and unable to do anything, so I want to become indifferent to this shit.

Please try to answer this question without judging us. Me and my boyfriend are currently in need of some sex toys. We usually buy everything that we need on Amazon, but sex toys aren't available there. I recently bought a vibrator (it was called body massager) from Amazon and it was very bad. All other sex toys on Amazon look to be of cheap quality and I don't want to buy it from there. We want a website/store which sells sex toys exclusively. We would like to buy different toys like the rabbit ears vibrator, the prostate massager, and explore other different toys to use in bed. Is there any trusted website/store where we can buy sex toys? I looked up on Google and saw a few websites where the toys were very expensive but at the same time, the websites looked sketchy. I dont mind paying for all those sex toys, but I don't want to get cheated and lose my money. If I get the toys home, it'll be worth it. So please tell me any website/store you know where I can buy the toys that I want and won't have the fear of losing money. 

Additional information: we live in Bengaluru, so we would like a store/website which delivers to Bengaluru. Thank you.

Also, I'll order the toys only after the lockdown period is over. But I would like to know the websites right now so that I can explore and decide what to buy.",1586149405.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,39,2

I cant bring myself to focus, I had a presentation with a foreign client and I was baked as fuck during the presentation and fucked it up.

Later my boss gave me 2 days to do R&D for a bigger project and it is already 4 days and tomorrow I have a call and I have not done shit.

In my office I am known as a workaholic and I am very passionate about the work I do. So they don't bother me much and they provide me lots of freedom and respect me for what I do. I fucking don't know why I am not able to focus on work I keep procrastinating.

Do I have to face any legal issues if I break the quarantine (in case my apartment neighbors compalains)?

Please suggest me what to do? Thanks.

UPDATE: EDIT :

I have booked appointment with doctor. I will be meeting with him at 6.30pm. thanks for all the suggestions.
Many of you suggesting to call an ambulance. But it makes situation messy in our apartment. The day government officials came to stick the quarantine sticker ,all the neighbours and apartment people got panicked. If an ambulance come they will decide that I am COViD_19 positive.


EDIT2:


 Just came from hospital guys. Doctor gave injection. He gave tablets for 5 days. I am feeling better now. Thanks everyone.",1586158035.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,25,76

If you are upset that there are some Indians who are ridiculing the thalis and diyas- I would like you to know that they are not against you, but are unhappy with the government and are against its glaringly divisive and cult practices. They are not against our culture but are against the political parties which are using it to divide our country.

And If you are someone who finds those thali bangers and diya lovers ridiculous - please remember that not every Indian is blessed with good fortune and privilege. For those of us who are not yet friends with science and the doctrine of individualism - faith, and a sense of belonging to a community still are their best friends. Yes, they seek hope and joy in such trivial acts. And I am sorry, but this is the country you are born into. Hate it or strive to make it better. The choice is yours. People are not the problem, corrupt politicians who prey upon them are.

Let‚Äôs learn to love and support each other despite the differences. Why?, Because Gandhi ji said so.

5316,"Citizens should stop addressing the PM's theatrics and just come up with their own activites as an act of defiance.I don't know what exactly the PM wants to accomplish with these people pleasing acts, but the one thing which is clear to some of the people is that this is far from what should be done by the government and the citizens. 
Those of us who feel this way should just stop participating in or even addressing these theatrics and as a bonus, plan and execute our own small scale activities. Activities which will keep the sheeple indoors, out of trouble and prevent them from spreading misinformation or anything. The fact that much of the country doesn't give a damn about what the PM or any other influential person or celebrity says should be enough to shut them up and make them focus solely on the pandemic. 
They don't know what it's like to see our neighbours, relatives and friends do dangerously stupid things during a crisis. They won't have to deal with the fallout. The media won't stop addressing this shit, the celebrities will keep spreading nonsensical things and other bad things will continue to happen. 
I think what we, as responsible and sane citizens, should do is this:

1) Just follow the WHO and govt guidelines regarding safety and health. 
2) Stop addressing anything the govt, the celebrities or any influencers say that doesn't focus on facts or logical steps regarding the covid-19 situation. Don't address any gestures or encouraging words from them. 
3) Come up with fun activities to engage yourselves and your neighbours to save them from participating in mindless behaviour. 

Even if small pockets of our population do this instead of submitting to whatever our leaders push on us, it'll be a victory. When we look back on this period of crisis, I don't want to see these influencers labelled as heroes and saviours. I don't want to see the glorification and rationalisation of these dumb acts. 

I want to see the stories of frontline soldiers and those few citizens who refused to be led into idiotic acts, who defied the system, who went above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the survival our their community and their sanity. 
Our leaders don't represent us. We are smart and sophisticated. History should remember how the citizens were the ones who kept the nation alive and kicking. 

I guess what I'm basically saying is, 

FUCK Modi, fuck celebrities, fuck those irresponsible assholes who have willingly and in full awareness of their actions ensured the deaths of thousands.

However, there is no option to pay via Amazon Wallet or Cards or Net Banking. One needs to signup to UPI and set it up with Amazon in order to donate through them. I believe it is a cheap marketing strategy which should have been avoided at this moment. Many people like me who do not use UPI because they simply don't want another banking service are frustrated with push campaigns already and this donation thing just triggered me to the point where I felt the need to post about it here. I quickly checked that Paytm is also accepting donations for PMCARES and they have no such strict rule to accepting money. There are obviously other means but this kind of marketing tactics from Amazon is unacceptable and needs to be highlighted.

5463,"College using our hostel rooms as isolation ward without any prior noticeHi all,

I have recently come to know that my college is going to convert my hostel to an isolation ward.

We hostel occupants are against this decision. They are breaking in our room by breaking our locks. Many of us have our precious belongings like documents and gadgets. They've said they will empty our rooms, collect our stuff and store it some polythene and store all that in some common area.  I took all my belongings with me except some of my documents (Mark-sheets etc) and I fear that they are going to get lost. Some of us have left much more like a whole desktop, laptops and other expensive things.

Our college officials can barely run a college properly and most of us reckon that this is going to end in a massive disaster where many of us loose our belongings.

All of this decision was taken without any prior notice. Not even a slightest hint. Most of were informed by word of mouth by our college mates.

I respect that our college is taking initiative and helping in this tough time but this isn't the way.

Some of the colleges got an order from DM to convert the hostel into an isolation ward but our college isn't required to convert hostel rooms into isolation ward because we didn't receive any notice.

Our janitors barely clean our toilets. And god knows how are they gonna sanitize the rooms after that mess.

5473,"People in tech, would you choose Noida or Bangalore for a jobI am a native of Uttar Pradesh and have worked here in Noida for more than a year. There are a couple of things I like here, namely the cheap economy, cheap rent, great housing in newly constructed apartments, great infrastructure with water, gas and electricity.

I'm from a top-tier engineering college and have a decent pay.

Looking for a change in job around start of 2021, and colleagues recommended Bangalore just because it has a lot more opportunities (in the category I'd be looking for) and should be my choice above NCR. Some of them have already been there and mostly came here for their families and advice me so.

Here's what I pay for in Noida -

Rent for 3 BHK (larger living area) - 18000, 6 kms from office, takes 20 minutes to reach in \~150 rupee split among two people per side for uber. Electricity is cheap. Gas pipeline is way cheaper than cylinders used at homes.

What's the equivalent for Bangalore?

&#x200B;

Drawbacks - too few companies to apply for.

Edit: From top-tier college. I make around 1.2 lac INR per month

At this tough time, there are lots of people who are looking for help because of complete lockdown and there are lots of government authorities, volunteers, NGOs who are helping them.¬†¬†  
There is a simple way by which we can help in this cause while being at home.¬†  
On twitter lots of people asking for help but they are not tagging right authorities who can help. **This is where we can help**. Tag all the tweets where someone is looking for help, with a common tag pattern:

  
**#corona\_help\_cityname**  
e.g. #corona\_help\_mumbai  
In this way, all the asks for a city are aggregated under one common hashtag and can be easily discovered by government authorities and others who are helping people.

Insider's Account: Covid-19 Triage Facility at IGI, Delhi Airport

Hello,

I landed in India on March 21 at 0800 hours at IGIA T3: Indira Gandhi International Airport Terminal 3, New Delhi - India, just a few hours before the ban on international flights ordered by the Government of India came into being.

I am ex-Prime Minister's Fellow (RD) and through this post, I am sharing my first-hand experience about arrival, covid-19 testing facility and everything in between, for whatever that's worth.

I hope my account will help you get a glimpse of what's ""really"" happening on ground. And how much are we really prepared as a country to deal with the pandemic. I have divided this post into 4 short sections as per the four stages of testing process followed at IGI, Delhi, as I understood it. Kindly note that I did not hear any government official or medical/security staff using these terms for different testing stages. I have used them for organising my thoughts.

**Stage Alpha: MIXING-1 (Arrivals & Immigrations)**

I arrived via Ethiopian Airlines flight ET686 at 8:00 am on March 21. As I entered the airport building, I saw the first screening checkpoint with 3 doctors waiting for us. Since I was the first in the queue, a lady doctor moved a handheld device in front of my forehead and took my body temperature. I, then handed over my pre-filled Covid-19 medical form to her which the airline staff gave us before landing.

Her fellow doctor asked me which country I came from? I answered ""Ethiopia"". He looked puzzled and had no clue where the country was (and that's fine - he was a doctor not a quizmaster, so I didn't expect him to know)? So, I told him it is in East Africa. Surprisingly, this being the very first screening point, he did not have a checklist of high-risk countries (Iran/ Italy/Spain/China/etc.) so that he could check and categorise me as a ""high-risk"" or a ""low-risk"" passenger. The lady doctor recommended him to call one of the senior doctors at testing facility and get further instructions on how to categorise passengers arriving from Ethiopia. He did not have his mobile with him so he asked the lady doctor to call. She did not have talk-time balance to make a call!

What they did next left me shell shocked!!!

Male doctor said *"" Arre phone nahi mil raha toh choddo, jaane do sabko"" [ ""If we can't connect (to sr. doctors), leave it. Let everyone go""]*

And my medical form was stamped ""Quarantined at Home"" without asking about my travel history or medical condition. Most of the 300 passengers behind me got the same stamping on their medical forms and we were directed to the Immigrations.

At Immigrations counter, roughly 400-500 passengers from early morning flights were either sitting on the floor or swarmed around the counters - some with masks, some without them. These were passengers who came from all over the world with travel history that apparently included visits to Dubai, Iran, Italy, China, Japan, South Africa, Spain, Russia, the US etc.

I call this MIXING-1 stage, so at:

MIXING-1: Apparently, infected and uninfected people were made to sit together at less than arm's length from each other in a partially closed hall WITHOUT SEGREGATION - by country, medical history, or age. Masked people sat with unmasked one, young people sat next to old people, pregnant women sat next to unmasked women taking maternity tips, mid-age uncles shook hands over political gossips, teenage kids sneezed without tissues and got back to their smartphones, and many coughed out in that same open space.

And these 700-800 people were made to sit in front of Immigrations counter for 4 hours before moving them to the next stage.

>>Refer: Photograph 1, 2 & 3

**Stage Beta: MIXING-2 (Post-Immigration)**

Post Immigrations, we joined a group of another 200 people who had cleared immigrations before us and were waiting to move to the next stage. So, we became a larger group of 1000+ people. At this stage, we were randomly divided into smaller groups of 10 people.

I call this stage MIXING-2 at which 1000 people with all sorts of travel and medical history and widely different demographic characters were segregated into 100 smaller groups of 10 people and were taken to the next hall. Since 10 people in each group were randomly selected out of 1000, this was the second level of mixing that was done. My group of 10 had five 60+ passengers - two Indians who came from Serbia, and a couple who came from Melbourne.

Those 100 groups of 10-member each were given numbers from 1 to 100 and then made to sit next to each other at less than an arm‚Äôs length for another 3 hours in the same hall.

>>Refer: Photograph 4

**Stage Gamma: MIXING-3 (pre-testing)**

Now, it was time to move to the next stage in the process. A team of a senior bureaucrat, a medical supervisor, and a police/security supervisor began calling three 10-member groups at a time and instructed all 30 people to stand in a queue at less than arm's distance from each other - some wearing masks, some without masks, some coughing, some sneezing, some even eating a banana or a cupcake.

Those 40+ randomly mixed groups of 30-member each were taken to the baggage belts sequentially one after the other. Luggage was already unloaded by airlines staff off the conveyor belts. So, it was literally a sea of baggage pieces lying all over the place from Belt #1 to Belt #10. As passengers began collecting their respective luggage, each touched at least 5-10 different baggage pieces before he/she could identify his/her own - and some had their gloves on, while majority did not. And some had sneezed or coughed into their bare hands earlier! Once everyone collected their luggage, each group was assigned a police officer whose sole responsibility was to take his/her group of 30 to the testing facility, set-up outside the IGI next to the Uber/Ola pickup point. By now it was 7 pm and my group was waiting for its turn to be called at the testing facility.

Note that since my arrival at 8:00 am to the time when I claimed my baggage around 7:00 pm, it was already 11 hours without food, rest or sleep. And till this point no official testing or consultation with a doctor took place. However, 1000 passengers - infected and uninfected - were randomly mixed in smaller and bigger groups at least THREE TIMES by then!!

>> Refer: Photograph 5 & 6

**Stage Charlie: O.K. TESTED (testing)**

Finally, at 8:00pm, 12 hours since I landed and checked in at the airport, my group was called to the testing facility along with two other groups. We all walked in with our luggage. As I entered, I read on the sign board ""COVID-19 TRIAGE FACILITY"". The facility had two rooms - one waiting room as you entered, and one testing room beside it with an exit from the facility. So, at a time, members of one group went into the testing room with their luggage while those of other two groups waited in the first room.

When I entered the testing room along with 29 members of my group, I saw 30 doctors in their quarantine clothing, wrapped head-to-toe in white suits, head caps, and transparent eye-gears. By now, we all expected doctors to ask questions about our travel history, our recent medical condition, and run some sort of blood and nasal swab tests. Right!!?

Well, we were all wrong!

As I sat in front of my doctor, she handed over a pamphlet. It had Covid-19 symptoms explained in Hindi and English on either side of it. She then asked me to read it and ask any questions or doubt I had! Though I did not see any medical devices, syringes, or nasal swab kits anywhere in the testing room, I was still hoping that may be the doctors would do it on case to case basis post-consultation.

My doctor asked me: *‚ÄúDo you have any corona virus symptoms?*
I answered with a *‚ÄúNo‚Äù*, expecting a few more probing questions about my health history, recent condition, etc.

To my utter shock, she picked up a rubber stamp, and stamped me with a

**Proud to Protect**
**Delhiites**
**HOME QUARANTINED**
**till**
**21 April**

Below are some of the questions and the ONLY QUESTIONS that my group members were asked before they were stamped ‚ÄúHome Quarantined‚Äù, without any blood, swab or other Covid-19 tests:

*‚ÄúDid you take a bath today?‚Äù*
*‚ÄúDo you take bath every day‚Äù?*
*‚ÄúAre you on any kind of medication?‚Äù*
*‚ÄúDo you smoke?‚Äù*

I left the Covid-19 Triage facility around 9:45 pm, roughly 14 hours after I landed in the morning. Many of my group members took connecting flights to Ranchi, Cochin, Bangalore, Mumbai, Lucknow, etc.

>>Refer: Photograph 7 & 8

In a nutshell, this is what happened in those 14 hours as per the plan which was put in place:

1. Around 1000 people were checked-in at the airport without segregation as per their travel or medical history.
2. Those 1000 people were grouped three to four times into batches of different sizes and demographic composition.
3. Same 1000 people were repeatedly made to sit with each other in the same space in close proximity for long hours.
4. Finally, most of those 1000 people after apparently infecting each other in the last 10-15 hours were stamped ‚Äúhome quarantined‚Äù at a ‚ÄúCovid-19 Triage Facility‚Äù without running any medical tests.
5. All cleared patients left the testing facility and would have mingled with the larger population in different parts of India on their way to their homes.

This all happened,

- while the rest of India was implementing ‚ÄúJunta Curfew‚Äù and Bollywood celebrities were clapping or banging thalis from their balconies,

- while NRIs were gloating with pride over India‚Äôs stupendous success at keeping Covid-19 spread under control,

- while uncles were explaining how government‚Äôs step will help ‚Äúbreak the chain‚Äù,

- while aunties were experimenting with turmeric and neem-patta recipes to cure corona virus,

and

**- while the media were busy running COVID-19 talk shows instead of reporting on the most vulnerable ENTRY and EXIT points in the country - our airports!**

**Special Thanks**

I am grateful to the frontline health workers, doctors, airport ground staff, CISF and police personnel and all the volunteers who discharged their duty selflessly, putting themselves at a great risk every single day, to help passengers complete the screening and testing process end-to-end. I have nothing but huge respect and loads of love for them.

**They were just following orders!**

P.s. By the time I left the airport, it was already 10 pm and given the corona virus situation in Delhi, I did not want to put my friends at risk. So, I chose to stay in a hotel for a night and then leave for home next morning.

I booked a room at **Lemon Tree Hotels** (Red Fox Hotel Delhi Airport, Hotel, Asset No.6, Aerocity Hospitality District, IGIAirport) for a night through a friend and reached there by 10:20 pm. The ground staff checked-in my luggage through security scan as I walked in towards reception. The lady there took my passport as ID and asked for my travel history.

I told her that I flew from Ethiopia and have been checked by doctors at IGI Airport for my symptoms and none existed. She asked me for a medical certificate so I showed her the stamp on my hand from the Covid-19 Triage facility. She seemed indecisive and requested that their home doctor would do my checkup. I readily agreed and waited for a few minutes. Soon the hotel manager (Prateek Shukla - not fully sure about his name) intervened and told me that they can't take me in. I reminded him about Delhi Government's order that gave people self-quarantine option at private hotels. I also mentioned the notice on their website (see photograph 9) that had no such information about denying entry into the hotel based on Covid-19 suspicion. In fact the notice's language seemed inclusive and empathetic. Despite all my efforts to reason with the manager, I was denied entry into the hotel that I had pre-booked.

By now it was 11:00 pm. I asked the hotel transport staff to take me to any other hotel in Aerocity, but was told that all hotels have internally adopted the same policy and no one would let me in. Given the ""Junta Curfew"" , my options were few (if any). I took a call to pick the first bus I would get and leave for home. I reached home at 4 am today, after 14 hours of mental torture at IGI, 2 hours of arguing with some hotel staff to let me in, and 4 hours of road journey - feeling scared, helpless, and angry.

5577,"We might have entered the exponential growth stage of infection in India that is characteristic of the spread of Covid-19. Here's how.The number of cases in India has risen exponentially in the last few days. [Going from 150 cases daily to now 500-600 cases daily.](https://i.imgur.com/zjRoSAJ.png) 3730 total cases in the country as of today, a week earlier, there were 1180 cases.

Seeing the [growth trajectory of the confirmed cases country by country](https://i.imgur.com/noXGCYY.png), it can be seen that India is still on an upward trajectory AND has not yet reached the peak, one essential thing that shows the slowing down of infection in a country. With other countries, you can see they've started to curve in the graph. So the worst is still yet to come, and we won't know how much the rate of infection has been until testing capacity is increased multifold. The infection spread rate however have slowed because of the lockdown.

The country needs to be prepared with the worst that is yet to come, with PPE, Ventilators and all other necessary equipment.

5595,"[Hear me out] Tabliki Jamat incident has screwed ordinary Indian Muslim's life for coming yearsUntil last week, everyone people, news channels, even the government was focused on battling corona virus. And then, this Tabliki Jamat incident came out and entire narrative shifted from 'everyone against corona virus to 'Indians against muslims spreading corona virus.  Videos(Some of it are true, others are not)  started circulating blaming it on Muslims to spread the corona virus in India. Terms like ""Corona Jihad"" were coined. News channels are running shows day and night how Tabliki jamat members spread virus to remotest places in India. Actions of few Muslim people (Incident in indore and tiktok video of a guy from Malegaon) gave it more fire. 

This is going to have long term effects. Amount of hate that is being circulated on whatsapp groups, news channels, Twitter and other forums is going to last longer than this corona virus fiasco. Many of the people who were able to remain tolerant (yes I am using this word, because they were not liberal only tolerant) of the Muslim people only because they had business relations with them are now talking about cutting off ties with them. Already news are coming where there been attacks on masjid and doctors refusing to treat muslim women. Once this corona virus fiasco is over, no one will pay attention to how Government failed it's duty towards daily wage workers, health workers but this incident will be highlighted and it will be used for political gains. Life of ordinary Muslims in India who had nothing to do with Tabliki jamat will get screwed.",1586073389.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,114,388

5657,"[askindia] Are there any hikikomori in India? Are you one? Let's talk about this.Hello, 

The home isolation has caught up to me and I'm wondering what it's like for people in India who have been reclusive and have been living at home for years and years. Is the phenomena of hikikomori different in India? I know many in our country are unemployed. Where do such people live? Are they truly socially reclusive? How do people make ends meet in such a dire situation? How do they cope with the extreme social isolation and general disregard of a non contributor in a society? What can people do to identify such behaviors? What triggered it for you? Is there a way to curb such triggers? 

If you do relate to this phenomenon please don't shy away and open up about what you feel. Indians suffer a lot of developmental problems when growing up. Some people are high functioning despite their inherent problem which often snowballs into something big, it's only a matter of time. Bullying and peer pressure play a huge role in our society and affects our personal decisions. How do we mitigate all of this?

I'd love to engage with you guys over here for now and have a better understanding of your expectations and needs. To whoever that participates on this thread: please be civil and respectful. God knows how much people have already suffered.",1586077068.0,,AskIndia,dark,9,10

5667,"Recruitment and sourcing in India. Need advise.So I recently joined a small consultancy as a recruiter. This is my first job and i have no prior experience in HR. Just need some advise for how to go about sourcing more profiles and dealing with possible candidates more effectively.  


What I've learned in my recent time here is the basic looking up profiles by searching , mass mailing, Job posting, etc. I have access to naukri and monster portals. Currently it mostly just involves dealing with passive candidates, and only getting a few interested here and there via calling. How can i make an effort to get more active candidates and more relevant ones?  


Also dealing with people in remote or rural areas, where people don't have good communication skills in English, or even in Hindi (south India, etc). Such areas also have a scarce amount of profiles on job portals or applicants. What would be the ways to get profiles of interested job seekers in such areas.  


The main issue is the setup daily profile targets, which let me say i don't have any problem with , but the fact that others (""experienced people"")  for some reason like to send irrelevant profiles or one that anyone will reject, while i try for more quality profiles and am more interested in resolving the recruitment process without anyone having trouble and the whole thing being beneficial to the candidate. (I know, what a pipe dream!. Not the way thing works and what not.)  
Also the fact that i am a fresher and am not efficient currently.  


TL;DR - Am a newb, and need advise how to source more profiles, more efficiently. Also recommend me references or articles about hr and related things so i can learn more. Thanks :)",1586091348.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,3

Also, our salary will be deducted by 10% for this quarter. May be extended for the full year, due to bad economy. The employees who are on the bench will get only 25% salary and will have to work for only one week in a month. They are not terminating them as of now, but if the economy performs badly, they may have to. This will give them a chance to look at other places.

I'm a software developer and working in Quovantis Technologies, Noida in a small company. It is a 10-year-old service-based company.

5843,"Get ready for a huge surge of Muslimophobia and Hindu nationalism after/during this lockdownI'll be straighforward: our country already has a lot of Muslimophobia (I am not gonna say Islamophobia because hating Islam as in ideology shouldn't be treated as a bad thing. Treating Muslims badly because you hate Islam, on the other hand, should be bad) and Hindu nationalism is evidently on the rise. Even though at first thought, it might seem that coronavirus may not affect the rate at which these two are growing, it is going to affect it in a huge way. 

The biggest blunder has to be the Tablighi Jamat. Out of 3000+ cases, 1000+ cases (more than 33% of the cases) has been linked to the Jamat. Among the rest, if you just see the initial list of dead people from corona, you will see a lot of them (if not most) had visited Saudi Arabia or other Muslim countries. As you might know, Muslims are already blamed for almost every historic and bad events. There is a huge chance that the entire coronavirus epidemic in India maybe said to be 'brought by Muslims to harm Hindus'. The number of fake news which tries to show that Muslims are deliberately trying to harm Hindus is already bad.

Unfortunately for Muslims, during this crisis when they were already being alienated by CAA-NRC, Jamat has been responsible for the steep rise in cases. Not that Hindus or other religions did not do something like that - Hindus got together in Vaishno Devi, they got together in many festivals, they got together during gaumutra party, they got together for 'thali bajaa'ing. But there has been no cases linked to any of those events. It might be that there are coronavirus carriers and cases among them, but since it isn't testable and observable, we cannot make any definite statement, it won't be scientific.

To make things worse, if we somehow get through this nightmarish pandemic, remember Modi will get all the credit. People will say that ""Modi handled the pandemic in India well"". This might even increase his approval rate among common people. Not to mention that if the apparent growth rate of cases in India remains slower than other countries, as it currently is, it might increase people's faith in the  superiority of India. People might say ""Look at those immoral westerners. They have been punished for their immoral lifestyle by karma. That is why India, such a holy land, hasn't been greatly affected by it apart from those Muslims and Chinese who brought that disease to India!"". This narrative might gain a lot of attention.

Times like this makes me value Dr. Manmohan Singh. He would've made an empowered expert committee to guide the country through these tough times, answered questions and through honesty at least would've been reassuring at the wheels. 


Currently though, we have a man who likes the sound of his own voice, lies like there is no tomorrow, hasn't been in a single press conference for the last 6 years while claiming to be the representative of world's largest democracy, makes decisions on a whim based on raw (absent) wisdom, makes people believe in stupid shit(my relatives banged thalis with the zealous fury of a mindless disciple) and makes them do unnecessary and frankly, demeaning things without playing his part in the crisis and is scamming people out of their hard earned money during a time of crisis. A party which is using this virus to spread it's communal agenda. A finance minister who has no clue or authority to discharge her duties. A home minister who is cut off from reality and can hardly be bothered by the deaths and hardships of the masses (as can be expected from a psychopath. If he can murder Muslims, he can watch Hindus die too - A murderer is a murderer). A history graduate in RBI with a wet noodle for a spine. A society that is so frayed that the government doesn't command universal trust like it did earlier.


Dr. Singh, history will indeed judge you kindly. I hope the BJP, which is bereft of all intellect and is like a PR firm with no product, reach out to the opposition parties like Congress, TMC, CPIM, AAP which have quite a bit of expertise by Indian political standards. I hope that some voice of sanity and courage still remains in that cabinet of zombies.

This divide will only further deepen if we allow the endless flow of misinformation and fake news through whatsapp and other social media sites.

With the coronavirus further slowing down an already relatively slow economy and increasing an already high unemployment rate, such misinformation will definitely cause more riots (or worse, a civil war).

The ones who will be affected the most by this are the poor. During the Delhi riots, most of the people who died and suffered were either poor or of the lower middle class and the ones who are suffering now due to the virus are also the poor. They will only further suffer if such misinformation that causes communal tensions are spread.

To the people who have read this post till now, if you see anybody in WhatsApp or any other social media site posting any misinformation or fake news, I implore you to call them out for spreading such misinformation and tell them that it is ILLEGAL AND PUNISHABLE if they further do so. Whether you are respectful to them or not is at your own discretion. If they still don't stop then report them to the concerned authority.

Our Government is a master in distracting people from the tel question, is this the same. As I see people celebrating this moment and not asking about the real question here why are we doing this? I asked my family members and some friends they all said it‚Äôs a Mini Diwali. Today lord Ram killed the Meghanath so we all are celebrating. 

Well that‚Äôs funny isn‚Äôt it? In my personal opinion this moment is just used to distract people coz in recent 3 to 4 days the daily new COVOD19 cases are more than 500+. And reports are emerging from across the India that doctors don‚Äôt have enough PPE they are not being treated well by the officials and the people they are treating. Some media houses is saying that government is not providing reliable data on the no of cases and the measures taken by them to tackle Coronavirus. Also the reason behind the new fund PM Cares is also not clear as the PM relief fund already has more than 3,400+ Cr. Rupees. And how government is using the money from PM Cares. These are just small questions which we really do need to ask from the government and they don‚Äôt want to answer that. 

So,  we really need to ask is that is this was really necessary or it‚Äôs just a new propaganda by government to hide its tracks like previous many. 
I‚Äôm not saying this is bad or you shouldn‚Äôt do it I‚Äôm saying we really need to focus on the real problem which is coronavirus in this case. Celebrate and ask.

5941,"How do I get my boyfriend's parents to give me a chance?I hate being a white girl barging in during a global pandemic to talk about my own shit but if anyone wants to get their mind off of it with some sweet in-law drama, read on.

So we screwed this up pretty badly. My boyfriend is Indian-American, his parents are south Indian and arrived in the late 90s. They're pretty liberal and open-minded, nice people generally, but he's their only child and kind of a prodigal son so every time he's dated anyone they've given him an extremely hard time about it.

Switch to me. I'm very in love with him. We've been together for 2.5 years, the first 7 months of which we were basically living together in a tiny cramped dorm room by choice, no arguments, it was amazing. He met me because he was doing a term abroad, we broke up when he left, couldn't stand being apart, have spent most of our time together in an LDR. He loves me too. We mesh well together, we have similar aspirations, we support one another, we think all the time about the future we want to build and how to deal with all of the terrors life will throw at us. Incidentally, I'm Canadian. I'm about to graduate from university. Once I do, I want to live with him again. The only way I can do that with my credentials is get married. We don't want a wedding or anything, we just want to sign the fucking papers so that the border guards will let us have breakfast together every day.

Switch to his parents. Because we live apart I only met them once on the pretense that I was his friend, because we didn't think at that point we would stay together. He has recently told them that we want to continue our relationship by cohabitation and that requires this legal maneuvering. Obviously, they fucking lose it. Now that marriage is on the table they are parading out the very real problems and consequences: financial costs, we're too young, etc. All things I deeply sympathise with which is why we broke up in the first place before thinking better of it. But the thing that's plagued everything from the start since they first found out we were dating is that I'm not the Brahmin doctor they wanted. The not being Indian has really been a consistent theme since we first met. His mom fucking cries about it, his dad is like ""I'm depressed from all of our financial problems and now you're doing this to hurt me,"" every time he does something they don't like they take it as a chance to lash out at him for this.

What we should have done is told them about this from the beginning, let them get to know me, build up a relationship where they know me as anyone except a gori witch here to steal their only child. But we didn't have that foresight, because we were worried about all of the reasonable things they were worried about wrt committing so young. But now our commitment is clear and the cat's out of the bag and his dad was yelling at him at 5AM last night saying they want to talk to me today basically to tell me to fuck off and get my life together. 

I don't expect them to ever accept me. I want to get a prenup and whatever the fuck so it makes it clear I don't want their goddamn money. But my boyfriend/fiancee and I want to start building a life together immediately, not however many years down the line they'll decide he's ""settled,"" especially if he's settled on a girl whose family they can scrutinise by surname. I just want them to give him as little of a hard time as possible, and preferably me, too. Thinking about this call makes me nauseous. They're just gonna tell me I'm useless for however many minutes. 

Idk that anyone can give advice but I need to try so I have less of a chance of screwing things up. Thanks randia.

6051,"Must Read : The plight of the Indian FarmerA few hundred miles from South Asia's glamour capital: Mumbai, a new day is marked by the lifeless body of another Indian farmer dangling from a peepul tree by a noose. More than 200,000 farmers have committed suicide in the last decade in Maharashtra's Vidarbha alone, an area the size of Portugal in central India. However, being an admirer of only the beautiful, the middle class Indian and their news, is carefully sanitized of any mention about these starving, sun-burnt wretches that cannot even afford the diet provided to one commercial European cow. The Indian farmer is invisible in life and in death. Thus, while his ripe, turgid oranges reach the gentleman's table, this abomination of a human being vanishes into obscurity, thrashed and ravaged by a burden of debt as the content hungry Indian media looks at the shopping malls and celebrity gossip to fill their pages.

I do not intend to ruin the appetite of my fine, educated compatriots on this forum, by whining the demise of a two penny cotton, orange farmer from India, I am here to enlighten you all on the ways of making these useless deaths profitable: the Monsanto way!

In the 1990s, Monsanto, ventured into India with its variety of genetically modified cotton seeds: BT cotton. In this introductory episode, I would skip the illegalities of Monsanto's field trials in India for which the Indian supreme court suspended Monsanto's Indian trading rights until 2001.

Fast forward to 2002: Monsanto's agents start approaching Vidarbha's farmers about these BT cotton seeds (later known as suicide seeds). The seeds were expensive, but Monsanto had already arranged with Indian banks for huge loan provisions to farmers who agreed. The farmers were promised unimaginable profits from these super-seeds, mostly verbally. Most importantly, Monsanto's agents were nice, personable and they actually addressed the Indian farmers as if they were human beings. When you are nice to the poor, you take away their bargaining power. Unable to read or write, these gullible, uneducated farmers put their thumb-print (in lieu of their signature) on Monsanto's agreement and approached banks for loans several times their annual revenue. The loans were all approved without any hurdle. The farmer was literally on a joyride, for the first time in several generations.

In the eyes of the erudite, this was a picture perfect move. In one sweep, millions of dollars of public money lying in the local banks became Monsanto's money, riding on shoulders of half-naked cotton farmers of Vidarbha.

Then reality struck: the crops failed, they failed miserably. When the farmers approached the same agents for answers, the attitude was different from last time. The agents pointed the illiterate farmer, who is unable to even sign his name, to a clause built into page x, line y of the initial document. The clause redeemed Monsanto of failed harvest unless the farmer had also bought Monsanto's very expensive fertilizer and pesticide as well. The news broke as hellfire on the destitute farmer that was already on the brink of devastation from three failed cotton harvests. There was no way for the farmer to afford these expensive fertilizers and pesticides.

Obviously, when the farmers approached the banks and local politicians on Monsanto's payroll, both referenced the same documents with the thumb print of the farmers and held the farmer alone responsible for their debt.

If you have decided to read on, let me warn you that there is no silver lining.

Until now, after each harvest, the farmers would save their indigenous seeds in local seed banks, but they have not sown indigenous for past several harvest cycles. So the older variety of indigenous seeds that the farmer sowed, are no longer to be found and worse still: Monsanto has bought over all the local seed banks. 99% of cotton exported by India is BT cotton, the indigenous varieties are all but extinct. These were the same indigenous cotton varieties that once clad Alexander‚Äôs army, the ancient Romans and the Egyptian Pharaohs. The native Indian cotton that led Europe into a global exploration for trade routes and set forth the age of explorations - is all but gone.

At this point, the Vidarbha farmers give up the fight, decide to swallow their loss and make the best of what they have. In the absence of indigenous seeds, they moved to sow the seeds from the previous Monsanto harvest. However, the friendly Monsanto agent came knocking back. The agent pointed again to another clause in the agreement that declares Monsanto's patent on the seeds and prohibits the farmers from re-sowing them. The farmer is flabbergasted, never before had they known that seeds can be patented. Farmer lobby groups took Monsanto to court. Obviously Monsanto prevailed.

Monsanto's victory over the naked starving Indian farmers was hugely celebrated in various disguise. Our very own Nature called it a ""boost for research"". 

The patriotic, nationalistic Modi government refuses to talk about farmer suicides. For several years, it refused to publish the suicide numbers. In Nov 2018 when a huge rally of Indian farmers marched to Delhi begging for their justice and relief, they were flogged and shot at by the Indian police, and not one mainstream Indian media covered the story.

The memoirs of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India 1773-85, describes the Indian famine caused by atrocious policies of another multinational corporation: The British East India Trading Company (EIC). Starving farmers would come to the city in the vain hope of finding leftovers discarded by the opulent employees of EIC. Starving and diseased, the Indian farmers are an ungainly sight for three centuries now. As the British sepoy would kick these wretched souls lining the street side, the farmer would cry out in agony: ""Baba!, baba!"": ""father, father"","" your countrymen have brought me to such misery, if it pleases you, I want to breath my last in your presence"". Like yesterday, the common people is just as engrossed in fighting each other and rioting, to be able to see the real evil plaguing them. India may have gained its own flag, but it is far from being independent.",1586062736.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,1,32

6104,"Looking information about a caste or tribe ‚ÄòChangar‚ÄôHello

The Changar tribe can be found in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Central Asia but they speak a language related to Rajasthani Marwari, Braj or Haryanvi. 

They must have migrated from North India to Punjab and then to Peshawar and Afghanistan and beyond. Along the way other low-status communities joined with them, some speaking Punjabi but assimilated together for socio-cultural regions. 

According to Wikipedia, ‚ÄúIn India, The Changar are largely a landless community, with a few still involved in their traditionally occupation of lime manufacture. Most are now daily wage labourers. Like other Rajasthani Muslims, the community has a caste association or biradari panchayat, which resolves intra community disputes and enforces communal norms. Although the Changar live in close proximity to other such Muslim castes such as the Hiranbaz, Sindhi-Sipahi and Qaimkhani, intermarriages between them and the Changar are extremely rare. The Changar are Sunni Muslims, and their customs are similar to other Rajasthani Muslims. They have been granted Other Backward Class status, which makes them subject to a number of affirmative actions policies of the Government of India‚Äù

This part I believe is true: According to their traditions, the Changar left Rajasthan, with their initial settlement being in the districts of Bikaner, Churu and Nagaur. From there the Changars migrated to Sindh. A further migration then took place to Punjab, where many are still found. They speak Marwari among themselves, and Urdu with outsiders. 

However it is dubious to claim that many of them migrated to Persia in the Sasanian Empire, from there to Sasanian Egypt to Byzantine Empire, where there descendant's became known today as the Romani people in Turkey, who live mainly in East Thrace.[1]

6121,"We need to extend support and solidarity to minorities and marginalized sections of society rather than vilify them if we want them to keep coming forward to report coronavirus symptomsWe have all seen how Muslims are being vilified after [a Muslim congregation](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52147260) sparked a new wave of COVID-19 cases. 
[List of names with addresses and mobile phone numbers](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/covid-19-activists-voice-privacy-concerns-over-leak-of-unverified-patients-list-on-social-media/article31236944.ece) of people who attended the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi are circulating on social media. Given the communal narrative being spread against them, this makes them extremely vulnerable to community backlash and hate crime.

A BJP Health Minister himself [revealed the names, age and locality of Nizamuddin returnees](https://swarajyamag.com/politics/this-is-why-the-names-of-the-nizamuddin-returnees-who-tested-covid-19-positive-in-assam-were-revealed) who tested positive in his state in an official press conference. He then asked the other Jamaat attendees to also come forward to face the same ""treatment"". Any guesses how many would willingly come forward now?

In most other parts of India, so far the administration [has made efforts](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/those-revealing-identity-of-covid-19-patients-to-face-action/articleshow/74590731.cms) to preserve patients anonymity, but I guess these rules can be bent if there are ""special circumstances"".

Yes, you could make an argument that other people need to know who they are so that they can stay away from them, but that can be easily achieved by using [hand stamps](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/privacy-fears-india-hand-stamps-suspected-coronavirus-cases-200320120033460.html) or [""Home Under Quarantine"" stickers](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/kerala-covid-19-stickers-being-stamped-on-houses-of-home-quarantined-families-1660543-2020-03-28), though IMO even these methods should be employed only on willful violators. But at least with these methods, only your immediate neighbors will know rather than the entire city/nation and any potential backlash will be minimized.

Charging people with the draconian National Security Act (which allows detention without charges or trial for up to a year) is also counterproductive, while that will definitely make violent people think twice before assaulting health workers, ordinary Muslims in UP, who are already deeply distrustful of the Yogi government, will now be even less forthcoming about their symptoms to health workers. 

Similarly, by now we have all heard of [how 5000 migrant workers were sprayed with bleach](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/india/india-migrant-workers-sprayed-intl/index.html) to ""disninfect"" them.

I want to convey to the govt and PM that stop fooling people. We are doing the best of lockdown for our own and society's best interests. You are unprepared and unplanned. When you make videos, We want answers on critical issues like:

- what exactly are you doing with PM cares fund? What is the progress?
- what is your plan to provide sufficient PPE kits to medical staff and doctors? By when? 
- what is India's plan to develop cure for covid-19 and by when can we see any outcome?
- what's up with economy and how you plan to fix it as covid-19 is controlled?
- what is the update on scaling up testing of COVID-19 cases?
- China built hospitals within days. Have you done anything like that or alternative to quarantine people?

I know PM wouldn't have exact answers to above questions. It's tough time. But he can atleast provide an update on these more critical questions in his video, rather than just praising public and asking them to do stupid things. Honestly, even I could do that. 

Secondly, this PM has no guts to hold press conference. Even trump is answering to reporters. Then why PM Modi can't? Why he choose to hide and talk from behind the screen only?

That's why I have arrived at my plan to keep lights on and play Bella Ciao. I know the neighbors won't understand what's it and I am safe.

Edit - Note: This plan was originally suggested by another user in a comment in another thread in India subreddit. I am forgetting his username. I and some of my friends are going to follow this plan as of now.

6218,"Delhi has not been given a single paisa from the ‚Çπ17,000 crore allocated to states. Here's whyHi there!

As is being reported by the news, approximately ‚Çπ17,000 crore has been allocated by the Centre to the States. Here is a representative news report: [""Centre grants Rs 17,000cr to states to tackle coronavirus crisis"", Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/centre-grants-rs-17000cr-to-states-to-tackle-coronavirus-crisis/articleshow/74975956.cms)

Of this ‚Çπ17,000 crore, ‚Çπ11,092 crore is the Union's contribution to the ""State Disaster Response Mitigation Funds (SDRMFs)"" and the rest is as a ""Revenue Deficit Grant"".

**Tl;dr:** The short answer on why Delhi didn't see a single paisa of this money is because the Fifteenth Finance Commission (XV-FC) has not included Delhi in its recommendations. This is because Delhi is not a state. The Finance Commission, a constitutional body, deals with financial relations between the Union Government and State Governments.

**Deep Dive:**

The XV-FC recommended creation of a new ‚Äúdisaster mitigation and response fund‚Äù üí∞ at Union (NDRMF) and State levels (SDRMFs).

These new funds are distinct from the O.G. üòé 'National Disaster Response Fund' (NDRF) and SDRFs under the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The NDRF and SRDFs are for ""*meeting expenses for emergency response, relief, and rehabilitation due to any threatening disaster situation or disaster.*‚Äù

The NDRMF and SDRMF are for *""local level and community-based interventions which reduce risks and promote environmentally-friendly settlements and livelihood practices.*"" Large scale mitigation will continue to be addressed by broad developmental programs and policies of the Union and State Governments.

*Note 1*: The difference here lies in the words **response** (NDRF/SDRF) and **mitigation** (NDRMF/SDRMF). Mitigation is pre-disaster. Mitigation actions reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property by lessening the impact of disasters.

*Note 2*: The NDRMF/SDRMF are statutory (legal) funds under the Disaster Management act, 2005 üìù. Just like the NDRF and SDRFs.

*Note 3*: the Supreme Court üë®‚Äç‚öñ , in 2016, in an act of judicial activism (üôÑ) directed the creation of a National Disaster Mitigation Fund (NDMF) and state SDMFs. This was criticized a lot cause the court‚Äôs got no business in the executive üíº working. This direction was not followed by most governments in India, and has remained a non-starter üö´

Similarly, the approximately ‚Çπ6000 crore of Revenue-Deficit Grants are only for state governments.

**Edit and Update:** It seems that an inherent fact is being overlooked by people in the comments. The Union‚Äôs devolution under the XV-FC‚Äôs recommendations is a *constitutional obligation* and was meant to happen regardless of the Coronavirus epidemic. It also seems that people are (rightly so) peeved at red-tape because effectively the Government of Delhi does not get funds to combat this crisis. Some possible financing mechanisms that I‚Äôve elaborated in the comments section are:

* Further Union contributions to Delhi‚Äôs SDRF (most effective)
* Making funds available from the Union Home Affairs Ministry (improbable given constrained budgets)
* Ways and Means Advances from RBI (30 day credit limit)
* Union spending through New Delhi Municipal Corporation (limited geographical spread)
* Municipal Bonds (underdeveloped and tight credit)
* Allocations from PMNRF and PM-CARES
* Donation drives from citizens and civil society",1586069395.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,64,385

So all of us are suffering in some way or another because of Covid-19; Some of us have the luxury of working from home, others don't. To all those who work in the front-line and help prevent the spread of disease or crime need help. There has been a shortage of Masks and other protective equipment. We should refrain from using them as much as possible so that there is not a shortage for workers, who need them the most. Sadly a lot of people just can't afford them.

Janata Shield is a project trying to create a network of 'makers' to produce protective equipment for essential service workers in public spaces (non-medical) and crisis resources for medical staff for the eventuality when we will have a PPE (personal protective equipment) shortage (specifically face shields currently). Contact with anyone with plastic material supply, 3-D printers, contacts in the healthcare industry/work in healthcare, government, laser cutters machines etc. can be helpful.

We request help from people who do 3-D printing or work with plastic in India suitable for the proposed plan. Or people in the government/local authorities who are interested in the project or private companies/startups and all.

The project is young and a website is under development to help facilitate any requests, donations or voluntary work. Till then you can check out our Instagram: janatashield

6254,"Dear Indians please read this post about Harsh Mander, a retired civil servant, who is feeding thousands of people a day.My fellow Indians, Harsh Mander a retired civil servant is feeding thousands of Indians a day, he is stepping up where the government is failing. He and other volunteers with him are risking their lives to feed thousands of poor people. They are stepping up where the government is failing it's citizens, they are risking infection when we are sitting at home as if it's a vacation. 

A few days ago the solicitor general of India put up fake and baseless allegations against Harsh Mander,the allegations were that Mr Maser had made derogatory comments that brought disrepute to the Supreme Court , the chief justice did not even hear to Harsh Mander's Lawyer and scolded Harsh Mander for bringing disrepute to the Supreme Court, they scolded him without even reading his speech and just based on what the solicitor general said. These allegations against Mr Mander was made after he made complaints of hate speeches during the Delhi Riots.

Excerpts from the hearing:
the Chief Justice of India (CJI) said: ‚ÄúIf this is what you feel about the Court, then we will have to decide what to do about you.‚Äù He also decided to defer a hate speech petition presented by Mander. ‚ÄúTill we sort this out we will not hear you but will hear others.‚Äù

Mander‚Äôs lawyer, Dushyant Dave, pleaded with the judges: ‚ÄúPlease go through the entire speech ‚Ä¶ the filing of the application by Delhi Police against Mander is an attempt to browbeat him ‚Ä¶ He is being put in the dock for nothing.‚Äù But, again, the Court did not hear the full speech. It continued to rely on the Solicitor General‚Äôs version now, presumably, supported by the police. And it ordered Mander to respond to the allegations and fixed an April date for the next hearing.

I request Indians to please write an email to both the solicitor general and the Chief Justice of India. The email should be polite courteous and should have 100% accuracy of facts. Please write in the email that Mr Mander has been doing great service to the nation and such treatment of him is not appreciated by the citizens. Please humbly, politely and respectfult remind both the Solicitor General and the Chief Justice, that the world is an uncertain place and that governments fall and rise in an instant, this government too shall change one day. The government may change but the citizens will remain the same, and the citizens shall remember the conduct of the members of the legal system and that you fear that a lunatic like the one who showed Mr Adnan Goswami his place, may someday also remind the members of the legal system about their good and bad deeds, and that the citizens of India shall remember the good and bad deeds long after this government has changed. Please send them a email together so that they both know that the email was sent to them together. Send it en masse so they won't be able to single out anybody. If you are concerned about your privacy use a VPN and an anonymous email system found online. Please don't let your message be rude, vulgar or violent.

It should come through own personal accord, not because a dictator asked you to do so. And I fuckin hate it when my phone buzzes like crazy with not only stupid whatsapp forwards but messages from banks and other apps. 

Lets face it, this ruling party in power has the tendency to execute its ideas in the worst, ill thought out way possible. Couple that with a society that's educated on whatsapp and they'll crank things up to 11. In the end, you'll have blackouts, that's ventilators suddenly not working and being dependent on generators until power is restored.

So to compensate for human stupidity and save the Electric Grid... Mitron, I ask of you to do the exact opposite. Tomorrow at 8:45PM, I'm gonna start my electric motor (1kw), my microwave oven (2.9kw), the electric kettle (1kw), charge up my laptops, phones and powerbanks, turn on the tv, fridge doors open so that it kicks in, all lights on, fans on. Basically, I'll try to consume enough electricity so that when my neanderthal neighbours turn off their lights, I save the electric grid and transformer in my area.

### Tl;dr

We wrote to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs to ensure reform of India‚Äôs internet shutdown laws remains a priority for the government. We have relied on the observations made by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* about gaps in the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 to urge for review of the Rules based on public consultation and economic impact assessment. 

### Background

On 10 January 2020, the Supreme Court delivered its judgement *in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* This case related to the constitutionality of the communication shutdown imposed in Jammu and Kashmir on 05 August 2019 and it highlighted deficiencies in India‚Äôs internet shutdown framework. ¬†The Court noted that the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 had several gaps which needed to be addressed by the legislature including the lack of time limitation for shutdown orders. As a temporary stop-gap measure, the Court put in place two ad-hoc procedural safeguards. First, the Court directed that all internet shutdown orders should be published. Second, the Court directed the Review Committee to periodically review internet shutdown orders every seven working days. Unfortunately, even these safeguards have not been complied with uniformly and internet shutdowns have been imposed in cities like Jabalpur without any publication of order.

The government seems to be aware of the import of the judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* but no concrete steps have been taken so far for review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. In response to a [**parliamentary question**](https://pqars.nic.in/annex/251/AU600.pdf), the Minister of State for Communications stated in Rajya Sabha on 06 February 2020 that the government will review the Rules and conduct stakeholder consultation in view of the Supreme Court‚Äôs observations. To ensure the government follows up with this assurance, we have written to the Department of Telecommunications and the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs.   


### Recommendations for Department of Telecommunications

We first wrote to the Department of Telecommunications under the Ministry of Communications on 06 February 2020 and highlighted the massive economic losses caused by internet shutdowns in India. In particular, we urged the Department to commence a public consultation to review the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. We also recommended that an urgent advisory be issued to all States and Union Territories to ensure that all internet shutdowns are ordered in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.*

Noting that there was lack of any systematic record keeping by the government, we have requested the Department to maintain a repository of all internet shutdown orders and conduct an economic impact to ascertain losses caused by internet shutdowns. We suspect that the losses will be extremely high with the Cellular Operators Association of India estimating that telecom operators lose Rs. 24.5 million per hour in every circle area where there is a shutdown or throttling.   


### Recommendations for Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs

We also wrote to the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs on 03 April 2020 to ensure implementation of the assurance made by the Minister of State for Communications in Rajya Sabha about review of Telecom Suspension Rules 2017. As per the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, the Ministry of Parliamentary Affairs is responsible for culling out all assurances made in Parliament, monitoring the status of their fulfilment and laying an implementation before Parliament. Assurances made in Parliament are usually required to be fulfilled within 3 months. However, in this case, the Department of Telecommunications has not taken any steps towards review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 including putting out a call for public consultation. 

We recognize that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the functioning of government ministries has been affected but this crisis also demonstrates how the internet has become a lifeline for many. Therefore, even if there is an extension of implementation timelines, review of the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 must remain a priority and the Parliament must be apprised of the status of implementation of the assurance made by the Ministry of Communications.

6384,"I am Depressed , Helpless , dont know what to do please Guide me and give me some Advice's , Please Help Me ! hi my name is Samarth and I will be 20yrs old this may. A little bit about me ever since I was 9yrs old I have been a fan of animation ( anime in particular ) and through various trials in my life from not been able to draw a simple circle to convince my parents to let me choose animation as my career path I have come a long way (I mean for me atleast) 

I don't know how to explain this feeling but for the past couple of days (7-10maybe) I have been very down , depressed , my heart aches daily like there's a hand grabbing my heart pressing it what not and I have even cried a lot before going to sleep ( silently although I wanted to shout at the top of my head but couldn't as it would wake my parents ) 

What I am trying to say maybe is that I am currently feeling as if I don't know anything about animation be it 2d or 3d ..everyday I keep on practicing and learning and try to do my best but it never feels enough and I am worried sick what will I do after I graduate ( I am in my 2nd year if college ) 

The thing is I am self taught because I failed my NID and DUFA exam mainly because I have been practicing art digitally since I was in 9-10th standard or so and the exams where in traditional medium my dad asked if I wanted to go for a private uni for arts but I declined the offer because I was told by a couple of people and professional that it's pretty much useless and I chose one of the easiest course in DU in the hopes that I will have a lot of free time to teach myself and spare money to buy equipment if necessary (my fee is only 27000 for 3years)  both of these things came true I do have a a lot of time and my fee is not much .

I knew this was a risky move getting into a course that's not related to animation ( it is, if u thing of it as a business because I do want to have my own studio and it does kinda help ) and I believed a lot in myself that I will do good but apparently I haven't ! As much as I want to tell my parents that I am scared as to what I would do in the future, I just can't because it won't help me and would only stress them because they will start worrying and it's not like they know anything about animation and would start making calls for knowledge and help ..I don't want to give them that kind of a stress right now .

I should also mention this I do plan to do a 6 month diploma on animation and fine arts after I graduate respectively 

The reason I made this post is because I wanted to let go of this feeling JUST LET ME OUT. And get a good couple of advice from people who are in the Animation industry as to how it works and stuff and get in touch with them , get some advice from people to resolve this feeling and most importantly to find myself a mentor who couple give me tasks to do this and that either weekly or monthly and later review my works and broadly point my mistakes and give me some direction 

All the hard-work would come from me but I need someone to guide me ! YouTube videos would never point out my mistake and I need someone to I guess

I will link my best works at the end.

I have figured I work best when someone gives me deadline to work with. I just need someone to tell me who actually has knowledge to from either school or industry to give me assignment and nothing more I will find what that things means etc etc and just review my work at the end .

I beg you if you thing you have that kind of knowledge and can spare 30-40min a week or a month please help this stranger ( I told my name in the beginning because I believe one stops thing of you as a complete stranger if they know your name ) 

You don't even have to give me your phone number or email address we can talk directly on Reddit message or Instagram or Facebook or any other app that you might thing is comfortable ( in case this message looks like a scam) 

But I beg you if you can spare a couple of minutes a week or a month to help me please do although I don't have anything to give in return but I would be ever grateful for your help.

PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.

6392,"We are facing one of the most challenging times in human history. We are facing one of the most severe medical crises since WW1 which will have economic effects that may rival or exceed the great depression. In such a time there is global deffecit of leadership from Modi in India to Trump in AmericaThere is a global crises of leadership. Under Trump and his America first policy, America has receded from the world stage leaving space for China, space which China used to gain influence over the WHO, the current chief of the WHO always had a favourable standing with China, with his rival for the chairmanship of the WHO Dr David Nabarro alleging during the race for the chairmanship that the current WHO chief has close contacts with China and it's leadership. These allegations are further reaffirmed when the WHO chief went to Wuhan on the 13th of January 2020 and issued a formal statement that there is no human to human transmission of the Corona Virus. The above events show Trump's failing as a global leader and the recession of one of the major democratic players from the world stage. Trump also took the Corona Virus very very lightly, downplaying the intelligence over the same provided by his own national agencies, he has previously ignored serious advisories by his national agencies, for example Russia's interference in US elections and the Khashguni murders. 

Now coming to India, no political party in India has ever worked on the health infrastructure, other than a few marquee projects like building one or two AIIMS. This is the same for this government as well, however other governments failings do not justify this governments lack of action with regards to building health facilities. Currently India has .8 doctors per thousand patients, which is well below recommended standard. I'm sure even this figure is inflated as of late the government has started to recognise or offering bridge programs to AYUSH doctors.

When the Delhi state government, started to build Mohalla Clinics, then the current ruling national government tried it's best to stop their development, the D.D.A, which is controlled by the Central Government, didn't alot them any land, forcing Mohalla Clinics to be built on the side of the roads in porta cabins. As they were on the side of the roads they are cramped, such cramped atmosphere promoted for the spread of the disease. Now the government knows that it's going to loose this war if a vaccine doesn't come out soon, and to be very frank a vaccine will take at least 12-18 months, so now the ruling dispensation is trying to divert attention on communal grounds, helped by the fact that one religious gathering carried the Corona Virus all over the country, in the same way that a religious community spread it in South Korea.

The question is whether now this crisis plays a role in removing these leaders and making way for a more sensible breed of leadership or whether it strengthens their grip on power as has happened in Hungary.

Edit: I would also like to add that the current ruling dispensation in India also is trying to divert the entire attention to a particular sect that has spread the virus in India, it's doing so that it can divert attention from the mass exodus of migrant workers, and according to the governments own admission in the Supreme Court 1 in 3 people from that mass exodus have a very high probability of having Covid19. Couple that mass exodus of covid19 carriers with weakened immune system of massive malnourishment present in the rural populace, will result in a higher deaths rate even among a younger populace.

Edit 2: now trump has stopped shipment of N95 masks, which was ment for and paid for by other countries. In fact a shipment of N95 which was just transiting through a U.S. port ""disappeared"", the shipment was heading to Germany.

Is Trump crazy, he is isolating America and Americans at their time of greatest needs. For example Germany is a major industrial power, it may manufacturer components that are needed in circuit boards of Ventilators, what if it stopped the shipment of those circuit boards? Canada has already pointed out that a lot of all nurses go from Windsor Ontario to North American cities like Detroit.

But what about states that achieve success early on and have no reported cases for a signiaficant duration of time? Is it possible for lockdown to be lifted early in such places? How perfectly can states isolate themselves from each other? If really well, then I believe going this route would benefit a lot of people.

Hi there! I work with the government. I'm here to direct y'all towards some sources which can help allay fears and make you help us help you.

* The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has frequent press-conference with the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Health, the Director General (DG) of the Indian Council of Medial Research, the DG of Press Information Bureau, the DG of the National Informatics Center, and the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs.

* Day before yesterday, the Government shared statistics related to current stocks and future projections for procurements of N95 masks, ventilators, PPEs, and Medicine during the PM's meeting with all CMs. They are available here. It also discusses speedy procurement. It is available [here](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/govt-pushes-speedy-sourcing-of-protective-gear-medical-items-6344860/).
* Daily updates are provided through the Press Information Bureau, either on their [twitter](https://twitter.com/PIB_India) or on their [official website](https://pib.gov.in/AllRelease.aspx), where you can sort by ""Ministry of Health"", or on their 24h daily-updated [bulletin](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1610771#) which amalgamates information from all Union Government sources.

Some miscellaneous issues that I would like to address:

1. Migrant workers, while stuck in a difficult position, are now being attended to by State Governments using money from the State Disaster Management Funds for room and board.
2. The lockdown is meant to buy time to formulate a post-lockdown strategy. Ideally, each state would have a mobile team of health workers who would attend to localised outbreaks of the virus (Eg. Nizamuddin in Delhi).
3. The Government has ramped up testing from \~3000/day on 1.4.2020 to \~8000/day on 3.4.2020 and is on its path to increasing further.
4. Deriding the PM's exhortions towards appreciating essential workers or lighting a lamp is extremely immature. Don't do it if you don't want to. I understand the slight that urban upper class privilege feels when asked to acknowledge the importance and significance of 'others', especially those below them. But both of the Prime Minister's requests serve essential needs:
   1. Clapping: Appreciating frontline workers who are risking the health of their families and themselves to stop the virus from spreading. Of course clapping isn't the only way of expressing your support and gratitude, but no one forced you anyway. Any charges of the PM being a ringmaster and citizens being compliant monkeys stems simply from whatever latent insecurities you have.
   2. Lighting Lamps: In this unprecedented crisis, each citizen is dealing with anxiety and deteriorating mental health. Many are away from their family. Many are going hungry. Engaging in a collective lamp lighting exercise gives hope. It provides essential psychological comfort and a sense of security by displaying that all 130,00,00,000 of us are together against this crisis.

Finally, I would say that in this time of national calamity and crisis, it is our duty as citizens to come together in solidarity and work towards the national directive. The best part is that the Government operates on an iterative basis through feedback and consultation. Government notifications are amended based on petitions by citizens, civil society, and industry groups. For example, exempting the movement of all goods from earlier just essential goods. So if you feel there is a problem, reach out and make it known.

They conduct loud Pujas during Navratra, twice a day. They conduct havans, Jaaps, Jagrata et al regularly, sometime even multiple times a month. Our family does that too, but not as often or at the same scale as them. 

When they're not engrossed by their loud pujas, however, I can hear them yell at each other - ALL DAY LONG. They call each other names to the extent that'd make a road rag blush. Nobody in our building, therefore, likes them one bit - they're a nuisance not only to each other, but to other families in the building too, many of whom have impressionable little children.

This made me think - What's the point of following any religion if it doesn't bring you an iota of peace or doesn't rid you of basic vices of jealousy, intolerance, harm to the fellow human, and lack of empathy in general? What would the cosmetic practice of religious rituals achieve in the long run if you are a progressively worse human being with every passing day?

6504,"Do you think Lockdown will be open after April 15? 

I think government can't extend this complete lockdown much given the economic cost to such a decision.

According to WHO Indian government is looking for time with lockdown of 21 days which means India was to get prepared with specialised rooms and wards for covid19 patients,ventilators,ppe,quality masks if not N95 ,working supply chains of all essential items,trainings of armed forces and medical practitioners.

More testing would result in more checks and readiness which was lacking till now.Recent approval of indigenous testing kits by Ms Minal D Bhonsale of Mylab which could give result in 2.5hrs is a welcome step and will help in giving clear picture of the crisis. South Korea and Singapore could contain the crisis only because of more tests and precautions thereafter.

There is also a hope from MIT led research which proved that continous temperature of 35deg could halt the virus spread.According to IMD officials the temperature would continously increase in comming days.

If Padma Bhushan Dr Nageshwar Reddy is to be believed, ‚ÄùMost important thing is that when this virus spread to say Italy or the US or to India, the genotypes of this virus turned out to be different. Sequencing of the whole virus has been done in four countries ‚Äî the first in the USA, second in Italy, third in China and fourth in India.

What they are finding is that this virus has a different genome sequencing in India compared to say Italy. This has a lot of significance because in the Indian virus, there is a single mutation occuring in the spike protein of the genome. Spike protein is the area that attaches to the human cell. One small mutation has happened, making that attachment weak. So, this will become an important factor for us in India‚Äù

A total lockdown for a month would take 8.5% of GDP.Fiscal deficit would further down 4.7% and NPA more than 11%.

According to Raghuram Rajan.‚ÄúThis is a very serious concern because not only does the lockdown keep people from going to work, it keeps them at home which is not necessarily that pristine isolated place, but can also be a slum where people live together,‚Äù

It is very important for India to not reach stage 3 of community transmission.If stringent measures are to be taken government must not shy away from doing so. Lockdown must be for school/universities,your travel,holidays,park,clubs,functions of gatherings etc and people of 50+ age must not be allowed to come out.

We must be hopeful for the above factors of temperature and genome sequencing and keep our fingers crossed for ours and health of our fellow citizens.",1586006742.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,9
6505,"Pitting a community against a political party is fucking stupid.First of all let me start by saying it was stupid whatever some muslims did at nizamuddin and still are doing by staying hidden and not letting the authorities do their work efficiently. 

But this rant is not just about this situation, it is about people's ignorance and lack of knowledge, people don't understand what is propoganda, and they don't know there history either and they continue to pit up a communuty against a political party. No BJP does not represent Hindus all it represents are the hindu extremists, so when i say fuck bjp, it means, fuck the politicians who are making this country burn. Bjp is the only party who has reached new heights and depths of instigating people to turn on each other, and paint muslims as someone who are gonna attack hindus for no reason. Regardless of what people want, a political party's job is to maintain communal harmony in a democratic country. What part of this people don't undertstand ? and why are dalits even supporting BJP's assholes, they beat up dalits, discriminate against them, all bjp is trying to do is keep brahmin supremacy in this country. Everyone is crazy about religion, i say fuck religion, if you believe in a higher power that is cool i don't care but killing in the name of god, fuck no.

Had to get this off my chest, sorry, and thanks for reading if you made it to the end.

If you have any objections to what i have said, i can conversate or debate sanely but please stop the craziness, use your brains i don't care what your parents, uncle aunties believe in, use your own brains otherwise India is not gonna stay a democratic country, and this is not even a baseless fact anymore, it's all around us, we just close our eyes to look around.",1586005108.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,73,190

First of of all: I love your country so much! Has visited two times and has been deeply moved by your culture, nature and people both times.

Second: I am a music-producer and I stumbled upon this short sound-clip that i used in one of my songs. Its from the Baul tradition and i wonder if one of you could translate the words for me? I have no idea what language it is but since Baul comes from Bengal Im thinking maybe its Bengali. [Here is the link to the song](https://soundcloud.com/processess/happy?in=processess/sets/happy-sad)

Thirdly: I am curious to know what you think of me using this audio. I have no connection to the Baul tradition except a few short (and beautiful) encounters in Kolkata. I don't want to cross any lines and use something thats beyond my comprehension of what it actually means.

They are not same intellectually, personality wise, thoughts, looks etc.

I'm not talking about dating or something but talking to someone in general, be it a guy or a girl. Also am not judging anyone, just saying how could someone be so different than what they are on social media and what they actually are.

6531,"About the Tablighi Jamat situationI saw this hit piece on Aaj Tak, about how the Jamat members in Ghaziabad allegedly passed lewd remarks at female nurses, sang vulgar songs and dropped their pants, which is absolutely hilarious to me. Of course, you can't put anything past anyone these days, but I highly doubt that the people who spend most of their lives, away from civilization, locked in mosques around the world, praying, and talking about praying when they're not actually praying, would do anything like that. That is literally the mission of the Tablighi Jamat, they're basically Muslim sanyasis. Seriously, it's a matter of pride for them that they have nothing to do with the ""material world"", as they call it. They're literally oblivious, which exactly why they didn't pay heed to the coronavirus situation. Granted, that was extremely dangerous and wrong, but I still very much doubt that these people even know any vulgar songs, much less that they can muster the courage to sing any in unison to harass the nurses. 

Obviously, there is zero proof of any such occurrence. Aaj Tak basically hovered over a letter from the hospital staff for a few seconds, which said that these patients were being uncooperative with no mention of lewd behaviour, while yelling about ""jamatiyon ki kaali kartoot"". Sure, maybe they have been uncooperative because they're stubborn fools, but I doubt the other stuff about them dropping their pants is real lmfao. 

Of course, this is my opinion, based on my knowledge and experiences, and everyone is free to believe what they want, but I'd encourage you to exercise a healthy amount of skepticism while watching news these days. More so when you're sitting with your family, watching channels like Aaj Tak or Zee News (I know boomers love sensationalized news stories). Don't believe any of it until you see absolutely concrete proof. Most people here know this, but these channels are trying to push a narrative (with support from certain people), and they'll go to any lengths to do so. Facts and consequences don't matter to these people, as long as they get more viewers. It's a win-win for them, their overseers get to disseminate propaganda and stay happy with them, while they get TRP. Then they can say things like ""Aaj Tak ne sabko pacchada, no. 1 since the beginning of time"" and rub it in your faces.",1585983166.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,26,0

6566,"Request / Need some help in Delhi - NCR with respect to traveling (Please read the entirety of the post)Hi fellow r/india members. Hope all of you are well and good in the times that we live in.

I have been a long time lurker and poster on the sub (not from this account, since I made this account for a request that is, for the lack of a better word, rather unusual), and finally decided to post here since no other avenues seem to be working out for me currently.

So I have this really close friend who's having severe mental breakdowns, and I feel like its gonna get worse as this lockdown stretches since he has a history of depression. The isolation involved has served to only exacerbate his condition. I have been trying to be there for him and do what I can, but even that has its limits since there is only so much I can do on video call or on call. I have seen him progressively get worse with time during the last 9-10ish days. I have also been hearing him say that he wishes I was with him since I am one of the few people that boosts his mood and spirits up. I am also one of the few people that is privy to this since I kind of back him up and he seems to cheer up when I am with him, and we have been there for each other through thick and thin.

I'm trying to figure out a way to get from Noida (since that is where I put up) to Delhi, so that I can keep him company and ensure he doesn't do something to himself during the remainder of the lockdown. He does not stay with family, which is another cause for concern. He lives in one of the localities in South Delhi hence, with these border restrictions and the lack of a car, getting there currently seems impossible for me. I have asked some friends as well, but I do not have any contacts that would fall within the essential service providers' subset. Please do help if possible, I will really be indebted. If you have any questions or doubts that you believe are making you refrain from providing assistance in this case, feel free to ask them in the comments or on PM. Will try my best to answer.

Please do help if any of you currently have access to commuting or travelling between Noida and Delhi. This is a sincere request. I will verify and back up all details if needed. May be able to pay some money for your troubles as well, idk, not much since I dont make a lot of moolah but whatever I can manage. I know my thoughts on this post are severely jumbled up, but its because this is a situation I feel truly helpless in and its beginning to eat into my mind since this concern is always at the back of my head regardless of what I do. I fear that with time, his panic attacks and breakdowns are gonna get worse and I really don't want to see him do something we all end up regretting. I know its a huge ask but please do help in whatever way any of you may be able to. I guess I am just counting on someone's humanity and concern to help me out of this.

6580,"So this happened with my food deliveryToday I ordered some food from swiggy. Order status was showing Delivery executive collected food and is on the way but from tracking his bike was showing off the route and it got delayed by 10-15 min so I called executive and he said he is on the way and will meet me in 2 min my apartment gate. I thought maybe some GPS tracking issue.

I went to gate to collect but he did not show up, so I called him and he again said within 2 min he will be there.

Finally he delivered food, When I checked gravy I found quantity was less than usual (50%). Also some gravy was over the package. I immediately felt something is fishy. I suspect that he took away some part of food.

I opened app and checked for help but to my surprise order status was still not showing delivered. I could not report the case.

After waiting for while I cancelled order from my end to get refund and got 100% back.

I was waiting for call from the delivery guy or swiggy but there is no call so far (more than hour now).

I dont think swiggy is at fault here and I am also not 100% sure with my suspicion. 

What do you think of it guys ?

TLDR : Order got delivered late, I suspect food was taken away, No confirmation of order deliverey, had to cancel myself despite receiving package. Got refund but feel something is fishy.",1586016602.0,#b8001f,Food,light,12,27

6618,"Call to consolidated actionThere are a few things that have become clear in the past couple of weeks of lockdown as well as the coverage of it around India and the central government's response:

1) India is headed in the same direction Spain is when it comes to Covid19, looking at the numbers it took us 8 weeks to reach 1000 cases, 4 days to reach 2000, and 2 to reach 3000+. The growth is indicative that we are going to see a massive increase in cases irrespective of whether we are in lockdown or not simply because the cases already existed prior to lockdown and now we are finally identifying the cases which have already spread prior to March 24th. the government is ill prepared, and it will show in the coming days, whether we like it or not. we will be losing more indians, we will be seeing more images of hardships being faced by the poor and by our healthcare workers.

2) the BJP has only gone and done it again and communalised the issue. we have somehow made this the tablighi janata outbreak and have pinned everything on that when there are massive clusters of people meeting in ayodhya or BJP ministers in the south holding pujas. my point isn't ""oh look at hindus"", it's the fact that religion is irrelevant and any sort of public gathering is detrimental to us. the Media and the BJP are only focusing on the muslims further propagating the narrative that this is something which they are spreading and portraying them as the enemy of the state. 

3) Subramaniam Swamy and his Vice interview have highlighted the BJPs agenda in a crystal clear manner. I have personally never voted for the BJP (including in 2014) as I was always aware of the RSS manifesto that drove their agenda and now we are finally seeing 90+ years of systematic, indoctrinated bigotry become fully a part of the central government's agenda. But what is truly horrifying is going through the comments of the Vice video and watching all these bhakts condemning Vice and telling them to ""stop with social justice"" and going ahead and justifying the BJPs agenda. the bots of the BJP have gotten exactly what they wanted through such a government, these sort of exclusionary policies are not outrageous to their base but are exactly the platform the BJP has run on since the Gujarat model. They are really out here partying like it's 2002. 

through all of this there is one plea i make of you, please hold your leaders accountable. when it comes to Covid, the one thing that is obvious is that this is only the start for India. Bhakts will have their reality check because as this virus spreads it is completely indiscriminate. it will affect them, it will kill their parents, it will kill their children, it will kill them, just as much as it could kill my family, me, your family, or a mUsLiM. as the number of infections and deaths rise in India, it is our duty to consistently hold our leaders responsible for acting. do not blame anyone else. not the tabhligi jamaat goers, not the ones who went to ayodhya, hold your elected officials accountable. they are making this a communal issue when this disease is going to kill irrespective of religion. 

i write this as someone with a lot of time on their hands but a lot of angst and anxiety in my mind because of the obvious direction this country is moving towards (Covid or no Covid). but this extraordinary time provides us with the opportunity to truly test our leaders and hold them responsible for the course our country takes. i honestly want to do a lot more and genuinely find an avenue to express this sort of discontent that is not just limited to like minded people like me. I know that places like reddit and instagram can be echo chambers in a lot of ways and i want to actively break out of that. 

If any of you share similar concerns but genuinely have ideas on how we can consolidate please message me or comment. we have the time and we have the modes, the one thing that the government cannot stop is a digital movement. the only point is we have to consolidate and act uniformly. 

what do you think is the way forward for a group of disenfranchised citizens who genuinely care about the future of this country? what are ways you think we could call out major media outlets or officials in a legitimate way? what do you think are basic principles which we have to hold our officials up to?",1585976057.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,16

My father suffered a near fatal stroke and his recovery has been slow. We took discharge from the hospital and due to the rising cases of covid-19 and also the doctor suggested to take him home. 

But the fate was not on our side. He started coughing a little bit and had fever. We were still feeding him from feeding tube. Today his health was a little bit down so we decided to take him to the hospital and they screened all of us for Covid-19 due to the symptoms. Fortunately we all are negative. 

In the x-ray,it's showing that his left lung has collapsed completely. These last 2 months have really been awful for us especially for my mother as she isn't really coping well. 

The doctors have suggested there may be pneumonia or positional collapse involved in this case. 
Our family really is in dire need of your help. 

I beg you to contribute whatever you are comfortable with to the fundraiser. Please, we need your help and support.

6649,"Roland FP10 and FP30 price/bluetooth functionality in India compared to USAI'm from Goa and im looking to purchase a digital piano.

I've gone through a lot of technical details between the roland fp10 and the yamaha p-125 from past month now (quarantining my ass off on this comparisons)  
I know the FP-30 is a better choice but the prices here in india...i think i'll have to sell a kidney to buy the roland. its stupidly high !.  
Roland   FP-30 - goes for RS. 72,824 or $952.96   
Roland   FP-10 - goes for Rs. 59,973 or $784.79  
Yamaha p-125 - goes for Rs. 53,189 or $696.02 

I know the digital sounds can easily be replaced after doing the midi wizardry (im a soft dev so i can handle those technicalities easily later) and by the looks of it both the rolands above have tri sensor keys which will yield much better midi data in case i do decide to swap out the sounds for (post processing? i dont know the right term for this). Thats why i prefer the Rolands for now and ofcourse because of their action (no i haven't tried them yet, because guess what, noone even has them on display here in the entire state).

My Questions  
1 - Yamaha Or Roland - which will age better? (lot of roland youtube videos complaining about loud keynoise after 4-6 months of usage while yamaha has no complains on the same). im planing to use this keyboard untill it fails to work or dies on me 7+ years easily.

2- Is that price tag justifiable for roland? i mean should i pay 100$ + just for the 3 key sensors ? 

3-i want to be able to learn complex arrangements of classical music later on (like Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata (3rd Movement)) which should also be fine on yamaha right?

3- Do the rolands in india have bluetooth connectivity ? most indian sites say ""does not come with bluetooth"" which i sort of need. anyone in india purchased this?  
4- Can I just use an addon accessory via the usb to host to transmit the bluetooth data to my computer? because in this case i can then get the yamaha and purchase the accessory.",1585989091.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,6,3

6733,"We would have gone into a recession regardless of a virus (PART RANT)People seem to forget we already had major financial issues that no one is really highlighting. Such as the bad rollout of Demonetization, the ILFS issue leading to an NPA issue, the slow growth of the real estate industry in certain metropolitan areas. The consolidation of banks, the issues with Yes bank and the impending NBFC crisis. On top of it Air India's bad performance and a bunch of real issues that have happened over the past 5 years internationally such as the trade war, Brexit and currently the oil war between Saudi Arabia and Russia.

The Virus isn't something that would have wrecked the economy itself it's something that multiplying the impact of the already existing issues. The situation is right now not similar to 2008 because that situation was a fundamental shift in what we thought was right. This is a trust issue in the markets and economics. There is a mistrust between the stakeholders of commerce.

We will get out of this virus eventually and the markets will recover. The stock markets are drama queens that are sensitive to everything. If Trumps stupid words could trigger a downward trend, then imagine what would have happened if shit actually hit the fan. Remember all the loss of wealth is imaginary in sort as it's based on perceptions. You haven't actually lost the money as long as you don't book your losses. For a person who had invested 5-6 years back in a stock, he or she had lost an opportunity profit but nothing was ever promised. That's why all these instruments come with terms and conditions.

If a share falls by 30% that doesn't mean that a company with really good fundamentals and performance track will lose 30% of their intrinsic value over minutes. On the other hand if a company was extremely leveraged and had pre-existing skeletons in the closet, it""s going to be horrible for them. This time is more of a period of companies opening up and being honest about their positions and less of a China propoganda or lockdown bad thing.

It's sad to see people lose their jobs but it doesn't matter weather 1 million lose their jobs every year or 6 mill in one freak event but it was going to happen eventually. There is a fundamental demand side shock that has happened in India tracing far back as 2016. It's ironic that the enemies and black money hoarders of the economy, the informal sector, your vegetable vendors, your kirana shops your local chai walla, are currently the world managing and actually saving local district microeconomic commerce with their supply chains and flexibility. 

Right now the world is in an icu and we are paying a massive hospital bill not because of the disease but because of lack of investment in the essentials like infrastructure, healthcare and education. The investment was directed towards other fancier things because it seemed cool or a matter of izzat to do so at the time. I hope after all this is done people don't forget about the local kirana shops and supply chain guys who managed to keep things running.",1585985275.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,21,80

6735,"Need clarification about CAA+NRC in Assam. How are they related?So NRC is an exercise done nationwide to identify citizens and illegals. It is first being done in Assam as the population there is fed up of Bangali illegals. The NRC ended up recognising 31.1 million people out of 33 million as citizens in Assam. It ended up making 1.9 million people stateless (still being able to appeal), and of those 1.9m, 500 thousands are Hindus.

Then the CAA came, it is supposed to fast track citizenship to immigrants who are of certain religions coming from neighboring Muslim countries.and prevent them from being illegals. This discrimination will apply to most states but the CAA doesn't apply to states like Assam.

So are NRC+CAA even a problem in Assam? And what is the fate of those 500k Hindus in Assam? And finally, why does the act only cover immigrants until 2014? Shouldn't it be an ongoing thing?

My opinion about the whole NRC is that it's an unnecessary exercise creating stress and anxiety to large parts of population in the country which are already poor. The idea of containing Muslim population is not that bad in my opinion, because if they become too many, then problems start. But this whole exercise is  unnecessary and a failure, as both Assam activists are angry and large parts of the population have been made even more miserable. India should focus on strengthening its borders and not allow Muslim illegals from neighboring countries, but why create all this unnecessary stress and suffering in the population already living in India?",1586009342.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,2

6744,"How bout quad-nation aircraft carrier for IOC# How bout a Quad-nation Aircraft Carrier Strike Group?

***By: Kartikeya Semwal***

With the ever-increasing threat posed by China‚Äôs PLA Navy in the IOC (Indian Ocean Region), neighbouring countries like Japan, South Korea and Australia have started feeling the need to induct and operate aircraft carriers of their own. Till now, none of these countries has an operational Aircraft Carrier (AC). Instead, they operate heli-carriers and/or ALS (Amphibious Landing Ships).

[INS Vikramaditya in action.](https://preview.redd.it/u5vc03vjdtq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=57ec478ae1ee8c7168dd6a52a2661b63d558e849)

But more than them, India feels the immediate need of operating at least 3 Aircraft Carriers (ACs). Currently, Indian Navy has a solo AC called INS Vikramaditya, a 44,000-tonne behemoth brought from Russia. By 2022, India will get its 2nd AC which is its own indigenous AC called INS Vikrant; a 45,000-tonne ship. Now since India has a vast coastline to guard, it needs 1 AC fleet to guard its western coasts & another to guard its eastern coast. 

[India's Indigenous Aircraft Carrier INS Vikrant.](https://preview.redd.it/47yvk30ndtq41.jpg?width=1016&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06ee4482729026193a3c104ff4877b688eafedca)

Guarding the western coast is easy when compared to the eastern coast as our foe Pakistan doesn‚Äôt have an AC of its own. Opposite to that, China currently has 2 ACs namely Laoning & Shandong, the later of which was inducted towards the end of 2019. With this, China‚Äôs power projection through it‚Äôs PLA Navy has increased by leaps & bounds; and so has its threat to other neighbouring countries including India. China is working on getting 2 more ACs by 2030 so that it can get under control the whole of IOC. Till date, IOC has been guarded by India Navy in coordination with Japanese & South Korean Navy. 

[PLA Navy AC Shandong.](https://preview.redd.it/eihzzbdtetq41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9422349c9d4eb3ed67cd560e87974a0fc4756f8b)

Indian Navy‚Äôs top brass feels that in order to maintain its power projection in the face of PLA Navy & to effectively guard the IOC region, it needs a 3rd AC which if accepted by Govt. of India (GOI); will be India‚Äôs 2nd indigenous AC called INS Vishal, a bigger 65,000 tonne behemoth that will pack a power punch. The only problem is lack of funds as its construction & operationalization over a period of 10 years will cost a hefty 6 billion or 60,000 crore. Due to this reason, GOI is reluctant to spend such a huge amount on getting a 3rd AC for Indian Navy.

[India-Australia Navy Officers.](https://preview.redd.it/2j33mhp2ftq41.jpg?width=259&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a8816ed265fbf0ff76f302bdbb30c51dc5f26675)

But there might be a solution to this problem, and that is sharing an AC jointly by 4 nations namely India, Australia, Japan & South Korea. Indian can have a 40% share in its ownership while the remaining 3 countries can have 20% each. This will help in a big way and can be hugely beneficial for navies of all 4 countries. I am hereby sharing the following points about it:-It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

1. Having a joint AC will reduce its overall cost including construction & maintenance & bring it down to 1/4th for each country. 

2. It can be built in 5-6 years if its construction commences in the 2nd half of 2020. This can be done by allotting construction of various parts by all 4 participating countries.

3. Each country can bring its best stuff when it comes to construction such as Japan for its electrical & electronic parts, Australia and South Korea for their weapon packages & crew and India for its expertise in hull & designing. 

4. Since it will be constructed by 4 countries jointly, it can be the best AC built till date as will have the best of features from 4 different countries. 

5. A huge amount of money saved in making it rather than making solo carriers by all 4 countries can be diverted towards developing a joint strike force to accompany & guard it; which will comprise of missile cruisers, frigates, destroyers, submarines & supply ship/s. 

6. Joint operations & functioning that will further cement international ties between all 4 South Asian countries. That will also include sharing of knowledge among officers & sailors. 

7. Automatic threat-neutralisation from China‚Äôs PLA Navy as it would refrain from attacking the joint AC as doing so will bring it to war against 4 countries of which 2 are developed & 2 are developing economies. 

  

[F-35 B taking off from US Aircraft Carrier.](https://preview.redd.it/oabivtx7ftq41.jpg?width=225&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1b8219f54d772f967fde8ea127edcbecc0112f8)

One point that can be decided later is- the type of aircraft that will operate from it. Now, this can be the latest 5th generation stealth fighters such as Lockheed Martin‚Äôs F-35Bs or the 4+ generation Boeing‚Äôs F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Now except India, all 3 countries have already ordered F-35As for their airforce‚Äô modernization plans. So they can easily get the F-35Bs which have been specially designed to be operated from ACs. 

But again, doing so would increase the overall cost of operating a joint AC which in-turn won‚Äôt be feasible. Add to it, while the other 3 countries are also NATO members, US won‚Äôt be willing to allow access of F-35Bs with Indian navy officers & sailors on the AC as it will help them get the technical and mechanical know-how of F-35Bs, which they might share with IAF, DRDO & HAL to help them make their own 5th generation AMCA (Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft). 

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet. ](https://preview.redd.it/xxbclpdeftq41.jpg?width=384&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=89250ac8e3e72e6a7d76e5b328f456b62877f469)

On the other hand, opting for F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III would be a cost-efficient step and will be welcomed by one and all. The US won‚Äôt mind sharing of technical & mechanical know-how about their latest variant of 4+ generation of aircraft as this jet fighter is also being offered to Indian Navy and Indian Airforce for their respective requirements of 57 jets and 114 jets respectively. Indian Navy‚Äôs fighter pilots will be more than happy to operate and fly the latest variant of Super Hornets as it will also get them 1st hand experience of flying these beasts. 

[JSDF \(Japan\) Navy Ships during Malabar Exercise with India.](https://preview.redd.it/nfgdxqrhftq41.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1db24b91d1148a6ea32964162d21cd14b4c83df3)

Now it only depends on the top leadership of all 4 countries as to whether to make this idea practical or not, to effectively check the Chinese threat in IOC. It is only a matter of time coz once if PLA Navy gets its 3rd AC possibly by 2025, then they might not be willing to back down. But if India, Japan, Australia and South Korea succeed in coming together and getting a joint AC & a joint strike group along with it together by 2025-26 then China would think twice before messing with it.",1586012654.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,11,13

I need your help. I live in a joint family (18 members )including my 1 year old daughter and grandmother in 70s. We live in north east delhi. I've had a conversation with each of them about the seriousness of this pandemic individually still few of them go out of House on a daily basis or someone comes to ours.

I'm really scared for my family's safety so today I'm planning to gather all members and talk to them.

I'm quite younger in the family so I can't just force them like kids. I want to give them facts that are missing on the news channels. Can you please help me with few points and facts so that i can make them aware about the seriousness of the problem we all are facing.",1585920167.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,9,16

The streets once again, were silent today
I thanked a god that doesn't exist.
One man spoke, his voice rippling into ignorant cacophony 
Many spoons hitting plates, their mark completely missed.

A plastic covered beam of illumination
Pelted away by the throng
As long as they have religion on their side
They can do, no wrong.

How long before the hate that we hold
Leads us to another holocaust?
Does the rage burn so bright in the face of a faceless prophet
That a fellow helping hand, albeit godless, we vindictively accost?

How many false deities must we worship in beasts?
Bathed in urine, exchanging faith for protection in spite
Of repeated warnings based in flattened blades
Of grass already trampled by this holy blight.

If god really exists, I tell you like this it reside inside
And anybody telling you different,
Just selling you religion
Trying to keep your ass in line

The streets once again were silent today.
This time, I prayed to the god that doesn't exist
That soon I'll be able to hear the children play once more
And that this deafening silence, may soon desist.",1585921284.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,0,0

6820,"The 9 P.M clapping isn't a mere display of histrionics. There's more to it.The sheer amount of power this man possesses is unfathomable. It is actually terrifying. The ability to manipulate people's minds, make them follow his every command. Persuading the people of the nation to play with whatever tomfoolery he comes up with, in order to conceal his lack of proper planning and inefficient management towards the lockdown is just astounding.

Similar to a monkey charmer that makes his monkey do as he pleases. If he wants the monkey to clap, it'll clap. If he wants the monkey to do a flip, it'll to do a flip. The monkey patiently waits for orders from his beloved master for his next act and will happily do it to please him. But even a monkey has an upper limit to which it could be pushed, but with us, humans, there isn't.

On the 22nd of March, when he decide to pull off of his biggest act. Every social media platform I checked was praising him for the gimmick?

Excuse me, WHAT? are u fucking serious? almost every top post was acknowledging him for things like |*uniting the nation*| |*cheering up people during these hard times*| |*lifting the spirits*| |*bringing us together*| |*creating a magical moment*| etc... nobody gave a rats ass about the doctors or healthcare professionals in the front line, people who were GENIUINELY putting their lives in danger of contracting the virus, for the well being of the country.

At first, it might seem like just a harmless gesture. You could think, what is the worse that could happen? This is exactly where most of his mind games comes into play. He reinforces behavioral traits into his subjects: to teach them, make them obey orders, build trust in their hearts and eventually become the messiah for the people. One act at a time, He's testing waters to what extent he can control his horde, last experiment was a huge success.

This is some God tier psychological mind game in action here by the biggest mastermind in the History of Mankind.

6823,"I am extremely tired of my life. I don't have motivation to do anything.I don‚Äôt have anyone to share my feelings, so I guess I can reduce my burden by sharing them here.

I am currently a final year student in a local state level government college in my city. The lesser said about my college, the better. I guess hell would be better than this sorry excuse of a college. During my 12th, like every engineering aspirant, I wanted to get into any IIT or NIT. But I had taken no coaching, so I had no guidance and messed up my counselling. In the end, I was offered a north eastern NIT. I was hesitant to go there. I wanted to take a drop, but my parents did not agree to it. So I took admission in a govt college in my city and stayed in my home, and prepared alongside college.

I was not able to perform well in JEE-Mains, but secured a rank in top 7k in JEE advanced and got IIT Varanasi Metallurgical in last round. Though I was not satisfied with my result, I was satisfied with an IIT seat. But my parents did not allow me to change college. According to them, metallurgical at even an old IIT was way worse than electrical branch in my current college. I tried to reason with them but to no avail. I was forced to continue in my college. 2nd semester exams overlapped with JEE Advanced date and I performed extremely bad, and got multiple backs.

I was heartbroken. I could not understand how I came to be in my current situation, even after working so hard. I used to wake up at 03:30 in the morning, study from 4 am till 7 am and leave for college at 8 am. I used to skip my lunch and study during lunch break. I returned home around 6 pm, and studied after 7 pm till the time I was extremely exhausted. I used to commute for 2 hours daily, so I revised my notes sitting in autos. Even after giving it my all, I had got only 7k rank in advanced. But now all my efforts were down the drain as I could not even utilize my rank. I felt I was depressed. I am ashamed to say but whenever I was alone, tears started streaming automatically across my face.

My cgpa in first year was extremely bad. To compensate for it, I had to forget my sorrows and start working hard again. I worked moderately hard for next 2 years and increased my percentage to 80. My college has no placements for core branches. So I knew I was on my own. I was confused whether to prepare for Gate or CAT. I had no interest  in engineering or management. In my college, almost all students in core branches prepared for GATE. Although I was not interested in my core subjects, but I started preparing for Gate halfheartedly. On Sundays, to relieve stress, I used to give a mock test of CAT. Solving quant questions somehow relaxed me. I gave CAT 2019 without any expectations. Imagine my surprise when I secured 99.8+ percentile in the exam. I was extremely happy on seeing the result, I had not even calculated my marks before seeing the result.

The GATE exam was in the first week of February, and my IIM A and IIM C interviews were in second week. I could not decide where should I focus. I wasted very valuable time in my state of indecisiveness. At last, I decided to prepare for IIM interviews. I performed badly in my Gate exam as well as my interviews, Looking back, I think that this is all my fault. I had no knowledge about what the IIMs expect from students. I realized the importance of position of responsibility and extra curricular activities after the CAT results. I had nothing to flaunt except my CAT result. I am certain that I would not be able to convert my best calls based on my performance in interviews. Even in Gate, I got 800ish rank which is not good enough for anything, as I am a general candidate.

So now I guess that I will have to drop a year as I have no job and cannot hope to get any, considering the current economic situation. Even after working so hard for the past 6 years in my life, I would be another jobless graduate. It is this thought that eats my heart. I don‚Äôt have anything to console myself, to give me motivation. I feel like a zombie, waking up without a purpose in life, going about like everything is normal. This burden is too much to bear.",1585923654.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,9,30

6865,"RESTAURANT UPDATE-HOW TO SURVIVE & WIN AFTER LOCK-DOWN ENDS? 

As per the article in [Businesstoday.in](https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/coronavirus-impact-50-restaurants-to-shutdown-if-lockdown-extends-till-may/story/399903.html) which is regarding the restaurant survival during the lock-down period in India it is said that:

**50% restaurants to shut if lockdown extends; Zomato, Swiggy business down 10% :** Only 5-6 restaurant chains have enough cash reserves to sustain more than a month, the sector will need government's help if there's no improvement after May.

Well, their is always a brighter side of the story! and this lockdown period can well utilized for all the research and development for the new market. Yes! you read it correct, it is going to be a fresh and new market, for you and your current restaurant too. So what does a new comer in the market does? What pre-launch preparation he does ? What he wants to boast about before and after the launch?¬†

Lemme tell you if you want to survive in this new market once this Covid-19 lockdown in India is over, you have to work upon one and only ONE thing and it is your RE-BRANDING & MARKETING! Yes, people must NOT forget your name from the market! and people must know what you are going to offer after the market is open. Obviously you are going to bank upon takeaway orders initially for few weeks or can be a month or two! Now when you know about this right now, then you can always cut short your staffing according to the needs of a take-away joint. Service guys can be asked to work on stipends for a month or can be motivated for the salary in coming month in part payments. Good ones will stay with you! Don't worry.¬†

DO NOT worry about staffing for next few months at-least, because their will be plenty of manpower available, filtered out from those restaurants who did not survived the impact. A great possibility of salary negotiation too.¬†

Work upon the ZERO waste menu. Do some research, ZERO waste menu is something where the only food waste is the stuff which once cannot digest or is toxic/not recommended to eat. For planned ZERO waste menu you may contact here and you might get some professional help if needed.¬†

Get a nice air purifier and alkaline water purifier if possible. Why? well apart from the health benefits, this thing is going to help you a lot in your re-launch event, how? We gonna talk in points mentioned below in a while. Their are hotel grades version for kitchen and guest area as cheap as 40k .¬†

Try to arrange your in-house delivery guy, so that you can save upon the commissions from Swiggy & Zomato, as their will be good number of delivery orders, saving upon the commission can save you your one month electricity bill for sure! Will tell you the ways to promote your own contact .

NOW: All is set you have done all of the above mentioned points, asked your landlord to waive off your rent and luckily he agreed! :)¬†

Its 10 days left now before lockdown gets over, what next?¬†

BOOST YOUR INTERNET / INSTAGRAM / YOUTUBE / FACEBOOK WITH ALL THE ENERGY YOU GOT!¬†

Now its time to hit hard with a well planned hospitality grade digital marketing campaign which is going to make your customers and as well as the potentially new customers about the things you have got for them once the market is open.

Its time to showcase your new ZERO waste menu with cool offers, you are going to shout about the healthy environment your outlet is going to offer to your staff as well as the people who walk in, you are going to boast about the alkaline way of cooking meals, you are going to boast about all the reasons you have for your existing customers as well as new customers to visit.¬†

A WELL PLANNED DIGITAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN TAILORED FOR HOTEL AND RESTAURANT NEEDS IS AN ONLY WAY WHICH CAN HELP YOU GET OUT OF THIS MESS AND HELP YOU SURVIVE THE CRASH. ¬†

WHEN HIRING ANY DIGITAL MEDIA EXPERT, ASK THEM ABOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE IN THE FIELD OF HOTEL/RESTAURANT OR F&B SECTOR. Why? Because if they know the 01s of F&B industry then they will be able to target your clients, menu promotions, promotions of your other food services easily. You just need to tell them WHAT YOU WANT. Rest you can leave all upon them, the deals, promo etc too, remember the points mentioned above, and don't worry! Situation is all fine, what is required ? a bit of creativity and vision.¬†

Same is the case with pitchers, yeh meri family, kota factory. They always come up with amazing shows which are relatable and fun to watch. Acting, character introduction everything was perfect.

I sometime wonder what would happen if any of their series is not able to excite the audience because expectations with TVF is very high among audience.

When I saw the trailer and Jeetu, I knew am gonna binge watch it on the first day because hey doesn't like to watch TVF series.

Episodes are small like somewhere between 25-35 mins so overall won't take more than 3.5-4 hrs if you binge watch.

6908,"Has anyone ordered Indane LPG cylinder online? I have some questions about that.I ordered Indane gas cylinder online and chose to do an online payment so I do not have to handle cash. *I usually call the IVRS and make cash payment.*

This is the second time I have booked the cylinder through the app but the first time I made the payment online and that is why I have some question this time.

**THE FIRST TIME I ORDERED:**

The first time I booked the cylinder online I chose not to make an online payment because I wasn't sure about the security of the app and the payment gateway procedure implemented.

The very next day of the booking the ""Invoice"" was created and I was told via SMS that the cylinder will be delivered however It was not delivered and the invoice to my surprise was cancelled and the next day a new one was generated with an excess amount of Rs 150. 

My problem is not with the money but what happened to the cylinder the invoice was generated for? Let's leave that to the side for now. I filed a complain because the cylinder seemed like it would not be delivered in 48 hrs and after the complaint the cylinder was delivered in a rush before the day ended. 

&#x200B;

**THE PRESENT:**

I booked a cylinder on the 2nd April and chose to make an online payment.

I know that the  price of the cylinder changes almost everyday and how something like this is allowed is beyond me.

1. ***My question is:*** since I have already made the payment and it doesn't seem like the cylinder will be delivered today, what happens when the price of the cylinder increases tomorrow?
2. Does it increase for me as well even though I have already made the payment?
3. Am I supposed to give the difference in cash?
4. What is the point in ordering online if the price does change for me and I have to pay the difference in cash?
5. Why is the government allowing this sort of absolute zero competition lazier than sarkari system systems to go on? 

It is diseased and everyone should be moved to piped gas and these ""agencies"" should be taken over by the government and poor should be given the gas for free or at a really low cost. I am deeply regretting refusing the piped gas BUT there is a scam happening there too so I am not really safe in any scenario but at least with this cylinder bs I still have some semblance of control.

I have tried to provide all the information and proof read what I wrote but I am a little stressed due to a lot of factors so I probably have made a few boo boos.

Any help/advice is appreciated.",1585921056.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,4

7026,"Will lighting a candle matter?It was the 10th day of the Nationwide Lockdown imposed by the government to control the spread of Coronavirus which began on 25th March. It was announced a day earlier that our honourable Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address the nation through a short video message. Everyone started anticipating what the message could be considering that when Prime Minister last addressed the nation he called for a nationwide lockdown.

But when the Prime minister addressed the nation he urged on 5th April at¬†9PM¬†for all of us to stand on our doorway or balconies switch off the lights and for¬†nine minutes¬†light a candle, Diya, torch or your mobiles with an aim to fight the darkness spread by coronavirus with light. He further said If everyone lights one diya each, then we will realise the power of that light. we will be able to highlight the objective for which we all are fighting together. He also requested everyone not to assemble in roads and maintain social distancing. He also appreciated people for setting an example of discipline and service. Prime Minister also said that when millions of people are enclosed inside their homes, there must be some who must be asking how can they alone fight this battle against covid-19? We are not alone. This is the power of 130 crore people. This awareness gives us motivation, gives us a goal and gives us the energy to achieve them, it further clears our path. Friends, amidst this darkness caused by coronavirus epidemic we need to constantly pursue to reach towards the light.

This was undoubtedly one of the shortest messages of Prime minister barely lasting 11 minutes and It surprised many when they expected a more action-oriented announcement rather than a symbolic gesture as lighting a candle. We must recall the earlier symbolic call for people to thank everyone involved in fighting the coronavirus on 22nd of March by clapping for them.

When the Prime minister clearly mentioned that the reason for the call for this symbolic gesture was solely to dispel the darkness caused by the epidemic. This was not enough for most of us to find alternative reasons behind this.

We, humans, have a high tendency to fill in the blanks when there is not much information available regarding an issue. Many Linked numerology behind 9Pm and 9 Minutes assuming that the Prime Minister chose the date and time after considering all the astrological logic behind it. Numerous social media posts were immediately created and shared widely and at the same time, there were sceptics to voice their views saying that instead of gimmicks government must concentrate on practical ways to fight the pandemic.

Also, some people who always believed that the Prime minister imposed his religious beliefs reasoned that he stressed the number 9 which holds its very own religious significance and asked not to step out of the house for the so-called demonic exercise. Below is one such social media post which was widely circulated among the certain community.

Be it Navaratri or Navagrahas, 9 is a significant part of Hinduism. They also believe that the mother goddess waged a war for 9 days against the rakshasas for deliverance. Hence the number 9 and the belief that by lighting diyaa, candles for 9 mins everything will go away. Mr Modi has earlier too asked all Indians to bang their plates n glasses in appreciation for the medical professionals which again had a Hindu belief attached to it, to ward off evil. He is a religious leader for many but we have a spiritual author n perfector in Christ Jesus and hence church pls do not fall prey and step out of your homes for this demonic exercise. Be wise and learn to read between the lines. Stay in your homes, let your lights be on and have a good time of family prayer from 9pm on 5th April and make sure you exceed 9 mins

There is no denying the fact the government and health care workers ought to do the practical things necessary to fight the spread of coronavirus and moreover, the government must support the people impacted by the hardships due to the Lockdown.

However, it is also true that we must not forget that a person can be killed not only by the virus but also due to the negativity that we are surrounded by. With the way, the information that comes their way about the havoc caused by the coronavirus there are many people who get very depressed. People die being depressed and their numbers are often not counted the way the people that are dying due to coronavirus.

It is Said that your State of Mind changes when you change your physiology. There are many physical ways to do the same as exercise, Declaration/Incantation/Affirmation, music and lighting a candle, dia is no doubt one such way to change our state of mind. Many of us would be constrained to do any other activity right now and there is no doubt that this symbolic gesture is a simple thing that we can do along with our countrymen showing solidarity against the challenge that we are fighting against.

It is your own choice whether to do it or not and you can also fill the gap by saying that it is not in sync with your religious beliefs. Whatever be the reason and even if the prime minister called for this exercise after considering various factors as being alleged I don`t see any harm in doing what he asked us to do. What harm will it have if you light a candle? I cannot digest any messages of conspiracy theories in this regard. The only harm I can foresee is if you have too much hand sanitizer in your hand while lighting the candle or dia.

Most of us would have stayed in their homes for the past 10 days and it is quite natural for people to feel depressed and uncertain about what the future has in store for them. The most anyone can do to fight the coronavirus is do nothing and stay in the house.

Let us Kill the virus called Negativity at the same time when we fight Coronavirus.

Was playing around with WhatsApp status in the morning, making fun of the policies how when we need more medical supplies and personal protection equipment to save lives, the government is making arrangements for the end with keeping you locked up close to family and showing you Ramayana.
Some people had a problem with that, ended up arguing with me, 2 of which turned into a fight.
Both of them either told me that I shouldn't be complaining or the way I am criticising about is wrong.

Both of them ended up telling me how I think similar to ‚ÄôJamat‚Äô people and how I should just shut up and do my job, also how everybody else is doing their jobs and making India proud, while I'm just criticising.

One of them ended up attacking me personally, and hence I blocked him, and the other one ended up blocking me since I wasn't respectful of the elders.

I thought I was just expressing my scepticisms and was being creative, but supposedly even working hard under life-threatening conditions (avoidable), doesn't give you the right to criticise the government.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

7070,"PSA: To all the bhakts,fans, ideologues and hero worshippersSTOP TYING UP YOUR ENTIRE IDENTITY WITH WHO YOU SUPPORT. 

Do not get too invested in any of these to the point that you suspend disbelief and let it consume your identity. You are more than just one thought or ideology. 

Your unconditional support to these makes you nothing more than a loyal servant. A useful idiot.

I know those words are harsh but there is no softer way of saying it.

By unconditionally supporting your dear leader, the favorite actor or the ideology that you believe in you let it consume your complex character and become this monotonous set of programmed reaction. 

You become part of the herd that follows its Shepard off the cliff. The rats that follow the piper down to death.

Did you know that you can show your support while at the same time critically looking at things based on their merits?

If you cannot invest your critical thinking, then at least don‚Äôt dismiss who took the effort of doing so just because it goes against your herd. Doing so might feel like a victory in the short run but it will set you up for failure since you are not receptive to feedback. After all how strong is your belief in those things when it can‚Äôt even stand the test of opposing arguments and ridicule? How robust is an argument which cannot stand cross examination? If you want your ideology or your fandom to sustain then learn from those systems and institutions which did sustain for years. They are all open to criticism and evolve consistently based on  feedback.

I know it must be very comforting and happy when you feel part of a tribe however distant and imaginary your role in it is. 
But there are also the negative aspects such as the ego death and identity collapse when these ideologies eventually fail the test of reason and argument. 

So be brave to stand apart in the crowd. Don‚Äôt let your stage fright get you.

Be smart in where you invest your support. Don‚Äôt let the piper sing you down the cliff.

Be safe and protect yourself from accidentally giving too much of yourself for something or someone without being open to criticism. 

It will only lead to ridicule, shame and regret.

P.S. - This is just a PSA based on my personal experience. Obviously this doesn‚Äôt apply to every kind of loyal supporter but, mostly to those who conflate their identities so much that it leads to mental and physical harm to themselves and others.

This is what they are doing:

- After buying raw vegetables, they keep it outside their home for 72 hours

- After 72 hours, they wash each and every piece of vegetable, even lemons and chilies with soap water, then cold water, then hot water

- After that, they keep it in the fridge or cook them

My friend is worried, as her husband wont listen to the arguments that soap can be harmful for the vegetables. They have a little kid as well. 

My question:

- Is washing vegetables with soap ok?

- How to convince that doctor to stop this, if his method is not safe?

- How can we ensure that the vegetables are virus-free?

7188,"Is Polygamy allowed in Hinduism?As all of you do know, according to the Hindu Marriage Act, it is illegal for Hindus to have more than one spouse at a time. 
However, this was a little confusing for me as I know that in ancient times, multiple marriages were prominent. 

Hence I went online and researched about this. I found in the Anusasana Parva, Book 13 of Mahabharata some insight on this. 

SECTION XLIV (44)


A Brahmana can take three wives. A Kshatriya can take two wives. As regards the Vaisya, he should take a wife from only his own order. The children born of these wives should all be regarded as equal.¬†2¬†Of the three wives of a Brahmana, she taken from his own order should be regarded as the foremost. Similarly, of the two wives permitted to the Kshatriya, she taken from his own order should¬†be¬†regarded as superior. Some say that persons belonging to the three higher orders mayntake, only for purposes of enjoyment (and not for those of virtue), wives from the lowest or the Sudra order. Others, however, forbid the practice.

A Brahmana, by begetting children upon a Sudra woman, incurs the liability of performing an expiation. A person of thirty years of age should wed a girl of ten years of age called a Nagnika.¬†1¬†Or, a person of one and twenty years of age should wed a girl of seven years of age. That girl who has no brother nor father should not be wed, O chief of Bharata's race, for she may be intended as Putrika of her sire.



I researched this on many forums and people seem to say regularly that nowhere in Hinduism is this neither discouraged or encouraged. However if that is the case, why do so many Hindu people scoff at the sound of multiple marriages? Also how did the Hindu Marriage Act come into for then?

I also found it strange how it says 30 year old men can marry girls of the age of 10...


If you are just going to be defensive and angry at me for pointing this out, don't bother to comment. My family is Hindu too and I'm just curious and would like to learn more about this.

7226,"PSA: Don't opt for the 3-month moratorium unless you absolutely have to and definitely don't do it for your credit cardsI see a lot of misinformation floating around about the RBI moratorium and though quite a few news outlets have picked up the topic since yesterday, I guess it is easy for news to slip through in this surreal climate right now. What prompted me to make the post is a friend who asked me for suggestions to invest the money 'saved' due to the moratorium on credit card payments for the next three months (which is a completely bonkers idea).  
     
When you avail the moratorium on your regular house/auto/personal/gold loan EMIs what you are essentially doing is equivalent to taking out a loan top-up of the amount of the monthly EMI for the period still left on the loan. So, if you still have 10 years on the loan and your monthly EMI is ‚Çπ20000, by deferring 3 months of payment, you have essentially taken out a loan of a little more than ‚Çπ60000 and have an additional payment burden of whatever interest (compounded monthly) is accumulated on that amount for the whole 10 years. Assuming an interest rate of 10%, this additional payment burden comes out to about ‚Çπ1L and a tenure extension of 8 months (over and above the 3 months that have been deferred). This might make sense if you just lost your job or going through extreme financial dishevelment due to COVID but definitely not otherwise.      

Credit cards are a whole other story. Their interest rates are crazy (about 40% per annum) which means that if your credit card bill this month was ‚Çπ1L, after the 3-month moratorium period with compounded interest still accumulating, you'd owe about ‚Çπ1,10,400. Moreover, this amount will stare back at you in full in June when it is very likely that your financial situation may not be much better than it is now. Given the facts, it makes no sense to avail the moratorium benefits for credit card dues if you are somehow able to manage the money. Even if you're under extreme financial duress and absolutely can't make your card payments, I'd wager that you'll still be able to do better than the credit card interest rate.",1585874776.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,23,121

7244,"5pm 'Thaali bajao', Raamayan-mahabharat, PM-Cares, 9pm 'Candle jalao'. Get it?These are lolipops. Their actual purpose is PR nothing else.

When the prior 3 things happened i was about to make a post but i forgot, i was talking about this pattern and told to my friends that just in few days this guy will toss another PR lolipop. And here it is.

And i am sure the IT-Cell will now make some pseudo-scientific message go viral everywhere. Something like candle/diya light radiation killing coronavirus/evil or something like that.

Let me translate to you what modi is saying : 

*""You all are dumb sheeps, you don't need to bother thinking how would country manage this epidemic when we are not even testing properly. You don't need to look into what we are doing, It's okay that we didn't banned export of ventilators and masks until just few days ago because we were busy buying MLAs in MP. You don't have brain, just be silent and follow our stupid commands.""*  

Let's not forget the govt's fuckups regarding this :

* [BJP/RSS claimed cowpiss and cowdung can cure coronavirus](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/cow-urine-dung-can-treat-coronavirus-says-assam-bjp-mla-1651708-2020-03-02)

* According to the guidelines passed by govt. If someone was in contact with confirmed coronavirus patient and if he ask to doctor to test him for COVID-19 then the guidelines don't allow that test, since he was not a foreign travelers.

Not only that, their was more guidelines which contradicted the previous ones and according to these you simply cannot test a person for COVID-19 if he/she does not have foreign travel history. (these were only changed few days ago)

7247,"Your annual reminder that India's AYUSH Minister promised in 2016 that we would have a 'yoga-based' cure for cancer within a year.Spoiler: We don't. 

Please note, he said ' prevention and cure' and not 'treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'palliative treatment'. He said, 'cure' and not 'help reverse the effects'. 

> ""There is an institute in Bengaluru. They have found a yoga technique for prevention and cure of cancer. We have collected all documentation and the process is going on,"" Naik told reporters.

[Source](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/yoga-based-cure-for-cancer-within-a-year-ayush-minister-1291302)



Please note that he said the 'cure' is already in the testing phase and will be approved within the year. Please note he said this is 2016. Please note that he said that the cure had been 'proved' - in 2016. 

> Mr. Naik said a technique for such cure developed by Bengaluru-based Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (S-VYASA) is just about a year away from endorsement from his Ministry.

Please note that the media mocked him and he never said it again, but he didn't apologise for giving India's 14 lakh cancer patients false hope. Remember this when you listen to his and his ministry's comments on coronavirus.

We are students here in USA. I know most of us have left India for a better future, but not all, some just came here with the thought of going back to India, making a difference. 
At this point, all the major countries are facing facing a huge pandemic. Though our Embassy here in the USA is working it's best for us. But, many are dying still, as per a recent interview by our Ambassador here, Mr. T.S. Sandhu, 10 indians were detected positive and 4 died(not sure of the death though). That along with the growing rate of deaths here in the USA, 4 days ago, maximum 300 people died in a day, from the past 2 days, 900+ people are dying in a day, and 25000+ are getting affected daily. The curve is growing, and it won't stop atleast for the next month or so. 

I wanted to make a request, can the government and the foreign ministry arrange for our flights back home? Back to India? Back to safety and a proper health care(usa would be modern, but not all of us can finance it here) ? 
We would be better safe back in India with a quarantine rather then here. Seeing the increasing curve here has got us all in a fuzz with little to no clearity of the near future. Also, that due to our univerties closing down, many of us lost jobs here. Now we have to depend on our parents back home to pay for our rent and groceries(which is huge, bringing back indian students can help in keeping the money in india, with the recession that is going to come soon too. 

I request the PM and Foreign Minister, along with other officials to please take a step fast and help us here.",1585885884.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,11,0

Okay so I came across this video today. It was shared by a family member. And then a scary thing happened. My mom, instantly after watching the video, replied on the group *""Subscribed!!""* and shared it in 2 other groups. I felt as if she desperately wanted to believe what she saw. I watched the video and I felt that the guy was looking for connections that didn't exist, or was tactfully skewing the perception, the guy who was trying to *seem* a little logical in a sea of illogical bullshit media. I wouldn't know though since I never read that book.

So I wanted to know what you guys feel about this video? Is it complete bullshit? Or is there some merit to it? He talked about demolishing the govt. That's not necessarily wrong, right?

I see my parents thoughts are heavily influenced by what the media channels show on TV. I see less questioning and accepting what they got on tv instead of searching of differing opinions and analyzing them on their own. They are well educated, and know properly to search and use internet but they seem to show no interest in it. What can I do about this situation?

I also feel I'm not very aware of what is happening in our country and find it difficult to form proper opinions about topic related to politics. What would you guys suggest for me to get up to speed and be able to engage in meaningful discussions on politics?",1585902132.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,15

And then they signed it off by saying that Modi is smart and he planned this entire thing keeping all of these nakshatra shit in mind. They read this on WhatsApp and started telling me all of this and say that this is a scientific method and how this will weaken the spread.

I got super triggered at the scientific line and said that it's pseudo-science not real science.

Then my mum tells me that all of this astrology shit has been followed for centuries in our country and even rulers followed it. 

Bhenchod, itna hi sahi hai toh haar kyu gaye Mughal aur British se chutiyo. 

Didn't say this of course, now my father jumps in and shoves it in my face that modi chutiya hai and that he's stupid and all of them are stupid. If I don't wish to follow these things then I should get rid of that thread I was given as a Brahmin child,  and stop having his name in my full name and make ends meet all by myself. Stop being this Mr. Cool and that I won't amount to anything????

Even though I understand that to a certain degree action such as this might help in bringing a feeling of unity or showcasing solidarity in the fight of this pandemic among the common people but I believe that a better and perhaps a more sensible course of action could have been suggested by him. Many of us who watch these news are from middle-class family and know that many others are worse off than us presently. How about requesting people to leave some food-items at their doorsteps or society gates. You don't have to donate a lot - you can give enough for one man's meal for a time or maybe even a single fruit and even if you can't there is no problem. Just like the municipal corporation collects the garbage nowadays they can collect this too, maybe the police patrolling cars can do so.

7431,"SENIOR CITIZEN SAVING RATE FALL-WHAT SHOULD I DO?Today I seek advice from all of you what should be done? What should be the prayer for an Old person who is dependent on his savings? Should be praying to GOD that Covid -19 come and take away the life or should he be living a beggars life. Well, don‚Äôt be shocked with these thought lines. The senior citizen segment is now struggling with falling interest rates which used to be their cash-flow. The impact of Covid -19 is beyond measurable for this segment of society. The ones who are not dependent will face the heat of the same.  Well, I am not here to lecture on financial advisory and how one can save oneself from the impact of low-interest rates. Well, the one for whom I am speaking hardly have the knowledge or adopted efficient financial planning. So it‚Äôs better not to showcase the knowledge of FP in this article.

The interest rate on PPF has been reduced from 7.9 per cent to 7.1 per cent per annum, a reduction of 80 basis points. For the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme, the interest rate has been cut from 8.6 per cent per annum to 7.4 per cent per annum. In the case of a 1-year time deposit, the reduction is 1.4 per cent as the rate has been cut from 6.9 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Any financial planning advice will fall short since after the accumulation phase the same corpus needs to be kept in safer assets to get the flow.

This impact is not new to me as we have seen the same in Post 2008 and in the last decade. But this is new to those who are in the elderly senior citizen segment. The savings rate has come down and hence the impact on life is significant. The rising cost of food and medical supplies are so high that they will have to face a major setback of cutting down expense.

The government policy of cutting down interest rates has nothing to push the Indian GDP to a significant kick start. Who will borrow and why he will borrow when demand is less. Why should I borrow when my job is at stake? These questions will chase and the journey of low earning from savings has kick-started now.

Now I ask this question to all of you about what should be done by that senior Citizen?

7439,"Suggestions for a Bakwaas College. 

Hi guys. This period of lockdown has been a time, where I reconnected with many of my old friends. One such friend I got in touch with, yesterday, confided in me, and I assured him, I'll help him to the best of my ability.

Both of us studied, undergraduation together(2014-2017) and could vibe very well, as we were misfits in an ultraconservative college. From, my past posts, it'd be evident that, I studied in a tier-3 college. I always, wondered, why did he opt to study in that shithole after a schooling, from the best CBSE school in the state. Later, I learnt that his father had insisted, he study there, and he didn't want to let down his father.

In 2017, that's when demonetisation occured, his father turned from the richest realty brokers in the town to a person with lot of debts. Hence, he took over the business, steered the family and now is in a financially stable situation again.

To give a perspective how mentally fucked up our NAAC A graded college was:

Incident 1) I've a best friend, Elizabeth, she introduced me to her roommate Rose. Now, the fucked up part is, Elizabeth figures there is something intimate between us two, she goes to the extent of calling Rose's parents and coming to my house to talk about it ( We knew she wouldn't jepordise it, but it was a word of caution). She is fine with the relationship if it was serious, if I'm ready to marry Rose, but Elizabeth went bonkers when she realized I was casual about rose and rose was implicitly casual about me.

Incident 2) In our batch. there was not a single women who put up their faces in social media, it was either a flower, baby or some other random crap. When I asked them, why ? They said they fear their pictures being morphed and their marriage (arrange) prospects being destroyed. Dafuq, I was flabbergasted.

Incident 3) There are women only in few unaided courses. If I ask a person, to introduce me to a women, it is considered a sacrilege. These retards, don't understand what is socialising and getting introduced to a new group of people are, they don't have any social pleasantaries wired in them. Similarly, if you break the ice with women you end up being labelled 'Kozhi'. An informal word for a guy on prowl for women, a fucboi.

Incident 4) Another guy, comes regularly drunk to class, however he poses no problem to the professors or . This another girl, lets say Maria, has warned him a zen times don't come in drunk. One fine day, she actually goes and ditches to the professor and huge drama ensues.

I hope the above are enough to put to light, regarding the level of mental maturity these kids posses. They live in a cocoon. These kids, though they are in college, they have the mentality that they are in primary school. It's nothing he has been used to.

He said, he was fed up of living for his family, he wants to enjoy 'college life'. He said, he is not worried about his academic credentials, because, at the end of the day, he is expected to take over his family business. However, his only criterion being, the institution should have an above average reputation Eg SJC Science and Arts, SJCC, MCC, Amity, Symbiosis etc such that his arranged marriage prospects don't get hindered due to his place of education. He is willing to relocate to any part of India, as long as he gets to party, go on road trips, host house parties, attend NH7 weekender, sunburn, play party games ( never have I ever, cards against humanity etc. ). You get the picture.

Now, this guy has money,though he is not as loaded as predemonetisation, he is what you call rich. What are few places that you'd suggest for him, he has got money and time on his hand. Would you suggest some options across India?",1585894130.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,0

So, I am not sure if this is the right place for me to post this but I'll go on. 

With the increase in uncertainty and the harassment that the medical staff working at front-lines are receiving off-late, I was wondering if we could do/create something to convey our support, appreciation and gratitude to them?

I think it's heroic what they're doing and that they're not backing down or giving up on us despite the different forms of torments they're being subjected to. 
They definitely need all the support they can get, and since it cannot be done physically, I think we could do it virtually. The same can be extended to everyone who's working to keep us safe. 
Additionally, we could also spread some positivity during these trying times since it's just deaths, cases and false info. being blared on TVs and whatsapp messages.

So, if anyone has any ideas on how we can go about this, please suggest. 
I can draw and create digital illustrations and I am 100% ready to put these or whatever skills I can offer to support this cause. 

Also, I was wondering if we could create a subreddit similar to r/CoronavirusSupport but for India? 

Thank you for reading this huge wall of text. I appreciate any feedback, suggestions and discussions. Take care, stay safe and healthy.

Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, told a news agency - ""Around 1800 people from different districts of Gujarat were stranded in Haridwar. With the special efforts of Union Minister Mansukhbhai Mandaviya and Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, arrangements were made to evacuate these people to their homes.‚Äù As a result of this arrangement, many vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport reached Ahmedabad from Haridwar. Interestingly, this work was done with such secrecy that even the transport minister of Uttarakhand did not get the news that many buses of his department had traversed distances of nearly 1200 km crossing the borders of many states during lockdown.

An order issued on March 27 shows that these vehicles of Uttarakhand Transport were sent directly to Gujarat *under the instructions of the Chief Minister's Office*. Their purpose was to bring the people of Gujarat trapped in Haridwar to their homes. **While returning, the same vehicles could have brought the people of Uttarakhand stranded there, but no such order was issued by the Uttarakhand government.**

Workers from Uttarakhand (working in Ahmedabad) who wished to return home during the lockdown came to know about these buses from their friends back home.

Mukesh Kumar says- ""The next morning, on March 29, around 10 o'clock we all reached near these buses. We were 13 companions a bus. **The driver of our bus again told us that you have to pay a total fare of 18 thousand rupees up to Rishikesh.** We found it strange but we had no choice. We were helpless, so we got ready and we immediately gave 18 thousand rupees to the driver. We thought that at least during this difficult time, we will somehow reach home. But that didn't happen either. '

These people are supposedly close to the Prime Minister and the Home Minister. **It is also clear from the official statement of Ashwani Kumar, Secretary to the Chief Minister of Gujarat, that while millions of people are trapped here and there across the country, these people trapped in Haridwar were taken out after special intervention by the Home Minister directly.**

Recently, I was in my family Whatsapp group, which said something about how awesome the 9 AM 9 minute announcement thing is because of astrology and shit. I replied in the group with a funny Arnab gif and everyone dismissed it. To make things worse, another unkill sent another video about some doctor explaining scientifically how this astrologically thought out move will help drive away the coronavirus in our country. If you ask me, by believing in messages like these instead of our Medical and Security personnel, who are putting their bodies on the line to fight COVID-19 for us, is utterly disrespectful and stupid. Plain idiotic. Because of all this, my anxiety levels increase and I feel pathetic to be a part of such people who believe in this bull crap of 9 AM, 9 times = mangal and all this shit.

7561,"Current approach of testing and forcibly quarantining in state-owned facilities of direct/suspected contacts is a flawed strategy!The govt. is totally screwing this up by forcibly quarantining families in state-owned facilities. They are directly disincentivizing people from getting tested, and a lot of people would prefer dying at home and faking the cause of death, than going for tests.

The reason is pretty simple. No-one is getting treatment in those quarantine facilities, and the chances of catching something in quarantine is rather high. At the same time people with chronic ailments won't get medicines in the quarantine, will be estranged from their families, and will possibly have no-way to get back home. Neither is this scalable in the long term. And community transmission is definitely here, so contact tracing isn't really gonna buy us much.


Instead mandatory home-quarantine is the way to go (much like the rest of the world). Informing people to self-isolate in their homes, whenever possible, and possibly using technology to ensure the isolation (neighbors shouldn't be informed at all as given the demonization of people with the disease, people would probably turn against each other. I know ensuring this is hard, but it's working in other countries, and we don't really have a better solution). 

The current approach is gonna result in more violence against the police and the doctors who come home from screening, and the govt. will soon be out of ambulances to transport people to hospitals/quarantines. The govt should get proactive about its messaging or this is gonna spiral out of control in 2-3 weeks.",1585918768.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,10,19

------

As tens of lakhs of Indians tuned in to their news channels/Twitter today at 9 am, we heard the leader of our nation ask us to light candles at 9 pm on Sunday.

In a time where medical professionals are being attacked by patients & their kin, where medical professionals are quite vocally expressing their need for PPEs, where people are clearly still flouting outside, the leader called this a successful operation & that the next step is to light a candle?

In a time where we see cases of migrants who passed away while walking hundreds of kilometers home, where in a city like Mumbai, there is still no proper arrangement to deliver essentials to residents, the leader wants us to stand tall at 9 pm.

And shortly after the speech, the IT cell went into overdrive & within a few minutes we recieved WhatsApp forwards stating how this 9 pm candle light will rid India of COVID-19. And there is no effort or modicum of effort from the authorities to dispel these fake forwards.

I am genuinely scared that people will take this as an opportunity to come out & do bonfires/candlelight marches, and what not.

Credit where it is due, the lockdown was needed. But, so was the planning. In a time where the world's eyes are upon India and Bloomberg put out an article that shows that India failed it's citizens, the world scrutiny is even more.

Should the leader have addressed points like:

- increasing testing (especially in areas like the Dharavi slums of Mumbai that can become a cluster in no time)?

- PPEs for medical professionals?

- urging people to keep medical professionals in regard & to respect them?

- held a call with top Virologists & Doctors instead of top 40 cricketers?

The WHO envoy might praise India & I seriously doubt if WHO's words hold any weight after their disastrous handling of the situation, but I can feel that the world is judging us and laughing at us.

We might be standing with candles at 9 pm, but the world will be looking down upon us with disbelief.",1585904361.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,33,58

Its also funny how people are letting these things pass like its any other field day in the life of a govt employee, and the scars over some nameless victim doesn't matter.           

The incidents of police brutality has mainly been on sections of the lower society ( at least the ones highlighted, im wrong if you are reading and faced the same). Not only that, the spraying of disinfectants like it's a nazi detention factory. After the death of an infected in dharavi slum, a colony was sealed without any intention of letting the people living in there know when they might be let out. It reminded me of a documentary of how the chinese authorities sealed (literally with a blowtorch) a dilapidated building, and the video shows some guy saying 'they cant do this'.

In the current Covid-19 situation , upper and middle class Indians were able to lock themselves inside their homes with months worth of ration supplies. I mean , most of us did it and it is the right thing to do. 

But let's give a minute to understand what will happen to our daily wage labourers or Mazdoors. The answer is , nothing is going to be done for them. Governments will launch useless schemes , promising ration and money but we all know the ground reality. It will not benefit 90% of the labourers. 

I know how smug and comfy we are in our homes. Even going to the market is something we don't want to do in lazy times like these. On the other hand , labourers are still walking to their villages with bruised feet , nothing to eat , nothing to spend with entire families at their back.  And do you know why nothing will be done for them ? 

#They are expendable 

You've heard me. India is almost the most populous country in the world. And you know the law , the higher a thing exists in numbers , the lower its value is. Millions of helpless Indians are expendable to our governments. It will not make a scratch in the population even if 1-2 million labourers die. And just for that reason , nothing will be done for them and they will keep suffering till the end of times. 

That is why, population control and education is important. I request you all to appreciate the hardwork of  labourers as well , they are a very underappreciated people. The same government which could make arrangements to bring back Indians from all over the world could not even run some buses or trains to at least facilitate the return of those poor folks back to their states,  let alone feed them (Kejriwal is an exception).In the end , these words of a local mazdoor are still ringing through my ears.

7679,"Tablighi Jamaat & CovidIt was extremely irresponsible for the members of the Tablighi Jamaat to have gathered in light of the covid pandemic. An FIR has been filed against the Maulana & others and hopefully the police will carry out a thorough investigation and the Court will determine whether they've violated any of the laws applicable and punish them accordingly.  


Let's look at certain facts pertaining to the situation.  


1. Firstly, this was a 3-day religious gathering, between [March 13-15](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696).  
And this was much before the lockdown in Delhi (from March 23) & the Nationwide lockdown (from March 25).
2. The Delhi Government has alleged that the Tablighi Jamaat's 3 day religious congregation amounts to a violation of their [Order dated 13.03.2020](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696), which prohibits *""all sports gathering (including IPL)/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people"".*   
\-  Note that this Order was issued on March 13, the very same day that the event had already    begun, implying that the attendees were already in Delhi by the time the Delhi Govt issued the order.    
\-  Courts will have to determine whether the wording of the order *""all sports gathering/ conferences/ seminars beyond 200 people""* will cover this 3-day religious congregation.  
\-  [The FIR](https://twitter.com/DelhiPolice/status/1244983752314564608) filed also alleges criminal conspiracy, which will also have to be investigated and proved before the Court. 
3. So essentially, the legal process has been initiated against them. And if they did violate any of the existing orders or law in question, they will be punished.  
In this light, holding a media trial is uncalled for. We don't even have all the facts in the public domain.   
For instance, the [Delhi Govt itself blames the police](https://twitter.com/AtishiAAP/status/1244892528945565696) for not having enforced its March 13 Order, given that the Nizamuddin Police Station is right next to the place where the religious congregation took place.
4. Further, a quick look at the general mood of the country as on March 13, points to the fact that concepts such as ""social distancing"" & ""self-quarantining"" weren't popularised by the Governments to the extent that we see today.   
For instance, as on March 13, the number of cases we had was 81, as opposed to the 2000 cases today, and addressing reporters, Health Ministry Joint Secretary had said on March 13 itself, that [coronavirus is not a health emergency & there is no need to panic.](https://theprint.in/health/coronavirus-cases-rise-to-81-in-india-govt-says-covid-19-not-a-health-emergency/380819/) 
5. A number of events took place between March 13 and March 22 ( Janata Curfew), followed by the Lockdown, involving huge numbers of people - religious places of worship with thousands of devotees, political events including toppling a certain state government, etc.  


While legal action has to be taken against people flouting the law, be it Hindus, Muslims, whoever, holding a media trial and bashing the entire Muslim community & trending CoronaJihad, does no one any good. In fact, it alienates the Muslim community even more & spreading more hate against muslims at large is irresponsible & criminal in itself.",1585832087.0,,Coronavirus,dark,5,26

General Facts: 
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.

The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

How it spreads? 
Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.

7752,"Open source app for COVID-19 tracking - need suggestions!Hey everyone, 

I have been working on an open-source app (DTrack) to track your potential exposure to COVID-19 cases. The National Informatics Center already has an app called Aarogya Setu and another one from Ministry of Information and Technology (MeITy) called Corona Kavach. But the main downside I see to these are that the apps are completely non-transparent with how they use your data. 

The idea is quite similar to what the other countries have been doing e.g. Singapore, South Korea, Israel and the MIT SafePaths app. The app uses Bluetooth to broadcast a random ID number and then once the person is diagnosed, uploads their ID to a central database, which your app locally verifies. It is completely open-source, both the app and the backend, allowing anyone to audit their data usage. Currently, I have managed to get it up and running on Android with the core functionality working. Planning to complete iOS support and Geolocation data for the next phase, over the next 2 weeks. 

Would like to hear any criticism from you all! Rip into it. I don't think this will take off, primarily because Aarogya Setu has the government behind it, plus even I would choose my health over privacy. But I hope this can make a small impact in terms of prioritizing privacy and at the same time provide us the services we so dearly seek.

You can find the app at - [https://github.com/anmolsahoo25/covid19-dtrack-app](https://github.com/anmolsahoo25/covid19-dtrack-app)",1585821536.0,,Coronavirus,dark,4,4

And my father recently started a drinking water dispenser. We refill and  deliver 20lts water bottles to our customers in their houses and also to wholesalers.

Now the problem is my father can't manage between his previous profession and this new businesses so he decided to let my uncle (28) to take care of the deliveries and collections, because he was jobless. 

It was all good initially but lately it has come to our notice that he scams money from the collection and resists to give us any information about the deliveries. When we ask him if he has got payments from wholesalers he just ignores it and says ""I don't feel like asking money from them, let them give when they can"". This has led us to a situation when we owe nearly 50k rupees from the market.
Being a small business, it's quite of an amount for us.

7803,"iPhone lineup price increased in India (Tax increased from 12% to 18%). Information, Tax Breakdown and thoughtsIndian government increased the GST for mobile phones in India from 12% to 18% a few weeks ago and this price change has been made per this change. Other companies are also announcing price increases, but since Apple products are priced higher (and most models are imported), the difference in Apple phones is harder on pocket when compared to other Chinese brands.

This will unfortunately tank the sales of iPhone in India, especially now after recession. Upcoming iPhone SE price will also be more expensive than expected.

---

**Current Taxes Applicable :**

1. Locally assembled phones (7, 7 Plus, XR) : 18% GST
2. Imported phones (11, 11 Pro) : 28% Import Duty + 18% GST = 46% Tax

Also something to note that this hike hasn't factored in falling rupee against dollar yet. Rupee was around 70/dollar last year when iPhone 11 were launched (Old Price in the list below) and is currently at 76/dollar, so expect this to cause a further increase in price and subsequent taxes applied on the converted rupee price.

I was planning to buy the iPhone 9 Plus to replace the XR that I donated to my mom, but guess I'll just get a PocoFone in the meanwhile and save up for iPhone 12. Well.. fuck.

[Poor UX of a fairly popular Indian bank's online platform](https://reddit.com/link/ftn4l0/video/feawzp2jfhq41/player)

As seen above, revealing options in select dropdowns requires special tricks. And input fields actually trigger sidebars (or dropdown?) in an already cramped box. Form generally follows function, but seems like the developers at [Finacle](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/corporate-banks/) were more concerned with adding wave effect to the buttons, and slide transition to menus than actually testing their rubbish. I'd give another fifteen instances of atrocious UI, but you get the gist.

If they can't even get the easier parts of writing a web app right, I wonder what sort of nightmare realm exists on the back-end.

There's of course the trend of forcing users to update their passwords every quarter or so. Do you append a number to your password and increment it? Well, most do, which is why it's such a shit form of security, and [advised against by NIST](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05). I feel for the non-tech-savvy folks who are probably writing their passwords down somewhere instead of using a manager. Some banks double down and require separate sign in and transaction passwords, each with its own rules, naturally.

7825,"I got scammed today because of my own foolishness. Give me some advice because I'm really shocked and frustratedSome info about me:

I'm in 12th class and I recently registered on Google pay like 2-3 weeks ago. I teach tutions to 3 kids and earn upto 1500 per month. My father is a retired army JCO.


Today my neighbor ,who is a very nice guy and a good friend and junior of my father, came to me and asked for my phone number. The situation was he bought a jio sim which was not activated even after 1 month of buying it. And jio customer care were not picking up due to some reason. So he called some  number he found on Google and that was scammers phone number who asked him for an alternative number. 


I asked uncle whose phone it was and he said ""jio customer care"". Then scammer asked if I used Google pay because a processing fees of 9 Rs was required. Uncle already knew I used Google pay so he said yes. Now scammer sent me messages on my phone which looked like gibberish at first glance and asked me to forward it to some other number. I did that. Then he sent me a link of a Google doc where he asked for 3 things: amount to be sent(9), UPI PIN, and bank name. And idiot me actually sent the UPI PIN. I was getting suspicious but I shrugged it off. 


Then I got a message that my bank account was linked to axis bank.After that he asked me to install TeamViewer app and at that time I knew that it was a scam but it was too late. 

Then I got two messages that a random number was requesting 4,999 and 4050 and if I approved then the money will be transferred. But then it got approved by itself and I lost around 9000 RS which took me like 10 months to earn. 


Damage control

I created fd of the remaining money in my bank account. And I changed the UPI PIN of Google pay. And changed password of my accounts. 
Uncle offered to pay me 9000 RS but I said I'll talk to him later because I'm really shaken up.


After all this that guy still had the audacity to call and and was laughing hard when I was cursing at him. During the call uncle said he heard voices of 2-3 people and some ladies in the background.


I am really angry at myself to even think that I will never get scammed and stuff. And I'm very sad that I lost my hard earned money. Someone please help me.

#Edit

Thank you guys for your support. Really helped me yesterday. I really needed help. Also thank you for considering to financially help me it really means a lot. 

Even if money's gone for good now I have learned my lesson and hope that the comments on this post will be of help to someone in future.

7917,"No Justification for Nizamuddeen and Stone Pelting as Muslim!I am a Muslim.

If the event in Nizamuddeen was carried forwarded by the ""so-called"" religious leaders despite warnings and information from the Government, then Islaam has nothing to do with what they did. I say ""so-called"" religious leader/scholar because no knowledgeable Muslim would/should knowingly lead his community or any other life to harm for that matter.

Muslims are taught and commanded to not even go to the Mosque for their daily compulsory prayers if they have eaten garlic and have its smell emanating from their mouths. The Prophet (peace be upon Him) said:

> ""He who has eaten garlic should not come to our mosque"" ([Ref](https://abdurrahman.org/2014/09/04/riyad-us-saliheen-imaam-nawawi-chapter-311/))

This is from the viewpoint that they do not harm or disturb the other prayer goers in the Mosques. So, how much more serious is the fact that you are told to keep away from praying together, or gathering together for religious purposes so that no harm or infection comes to another person because of you?! 

And there are several other commands to a Muslim to take the utmost care in not harming another life in any manner. One of the verses in the Qur'aan says (what means):

> ""if anyone killed a person not in retaliation of murder, or (and) to spread mischief in the land - it would be as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of all mankind"" ([Qur'aan 5:32](https://quran.com/5/32?translations=18))

Another saying of the Prophet (peace be upon Him):

> ‚ÄúDo not harm and do not reciprocate harm.‚Äù ([Ref](https://www.troid.org/ibadah/knowledge/important-materials/523-the-importance-of-intention))

I myself am very consistent with regards to my daily 5 prayers **IN THE MOSQUE IN CONGREGATION**. However, once the situation with Covid occurred and once the orders came in place to maintain social distancing, me and several of us resorted to staying and praying in our homes.

These people felt they're more virtuous thinking that the virus wont harm them and they'll continue praying in congregation? Forget their own selves and think about the hundreds that would've been harmed by a single one of you. There is no defending their actions. **It was and is wrong**. BUT, it is all based on the news I've read that they purposely ignored warnings and orders to disperse.

And to add to that, these (allegedly) Muslim communities, pelting stones at those who are out to help you?! How ridiculous. Bhai.. is se bada chutyaap tho ho hi nahin saktha. That too at a time, when many are (maybe correctly) blaming Muslims of not doing enough during this outbreak of Corona. Aur bhi naam barbaad kar diya. Basically proved whatever you are being accused of.

Another saying of the Prophet (peace be upon Him) that comes to mind, which is related to plague:

> ""If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place."" ([Ref](https://sunnah.com/bukhari/76/43)) [*Unsure about the authenticity of this specific narration. But authentic narrations with similar meaning do exist*]
> 

I have understood this narration in the light that, if you're in a place with the outbreak of plague, then do not leave it so that you don't carry and spread it among others.

**There is no Islaamic justification for these acts**. With regards to the Nizamuddeen event itself;

1. You ignore all the above religious commandments
2. You break the covenant and ignore the rules put in place by those given authority above you
3. You ignore the plea of your fellow humans
4. You congregate for a 'Religious gathering' which in itself is not approved in Islaam, and is considered an innovation (another topic to be discussed entirely). And innovations are censured in the harshest manner with the sayings of the Prophet (peace be upon Him):

> ""Whoever introduces something into this affair of ours something which does not belong to it will have it rejected"" ([Ref](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=IBD01&articleID=IBD010004&articlePages=1))
> 

> ""and every innovation is misguidance and all misguidance is in the Hellfire."" ([Ref](http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/sp.cfm?subsecID=BDH05&articleID=BDH050003&articlePages=1))

So, as I said. If they did indeed ignore warnings and carried on with their gathering, then the burden is upon them. Islaam is free from their actions. They shouldn't use Islaam to justify their wrongdoing. And I hope the impact of their wrongdoing can be controlled and innocents be saved from being affected with Covid or any other ailment for that matter.",1585829831.0,,Coronavirus,dark,110,451
