91,"What's next for the CAA+NPR+NRC protestsIn the aftermath of the Delhi pogrom, the spotlight the protests were occupying seems to be diminishing with every passing day. 

Moreover most of the talk about the pogroms is emotionally charged gossip. The AAP's complicity by not taking any action at all, and failing miserably with connecting with public, is conveniently being neglected. AAP needs to make amends. We can still look up to AAP in the hope that they are unlike BJP.

The onus should not be on the victims to be left to fight for themselves.  When all the institutions of the establishment fail, the civil society must to step in. Some altruistic people are already taking good steps by volunteering relief material but the scale is abysmal. The victims are left at the benevolence of a few, the state is turning away, the judiciary is abdicating from its responsibilities. Like what kinda mess is this. I hope more people can offer help other than just pity and the state addresses the situation with the urgency that it begs. 


Aside from that, we must remind ourselves that the CAA, NPR and NRC monster is still lurking. It hasn't gone away. India isn't in good hands. The establishment is trying too hard to suppress dissent and they seem to get away with every illegal thing they do. They have a great sense of entitlement. But the protests must go on to protect the idea of India our forefathers had envisioned, to protect the values enshrined in our constitution.

213,"WHO findings after trip to China - 5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. We Indians are so fucked if this gets here!The WHO has sent a team of international experts to China to investigate the situation, including Clifford Lane, Clinical Director at the US National Institutes of Health. Here is the press conference on Youtube and the final report of the commission as PDF after they visited Beijing, Wuhan, Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Chengdu. Here are some interesting facts about Covid that I have not yet read in the media:

When a cluster of several infected people occurred in China, it was most often (78-85%) caused by an infection within the family by droplets and other carriers of infection in close contact with an infected person. Transmission by fine aerosols in the air over long distances is not one of the main causes of spread. Most of the 2,055 infected hospital workers were either infected at home or in the early phase of the outbreak in Wuhan when hospital safeguards were not raised yet.

5% of people who are diagnosed with Covid require artificial respiration. Another 15% need to breathe in highly concentrated oxygen - and not just for a few days. The duration from the beginning of the disease until recovery is 3 to 6 weeks on average for these severe and critical patients (compared to only 2 weeks for the mildly ill). The mass and duration of the treatments overburdened the existing health care system in Wuhan many times over. The province of Hubei, whose capital is Wuhan, had 65,596 infected persons so far. A total of 40,000 employees were sent to Hubei from other provinces to help fight the epidemic. 45 hospitals in Wuhan are caring for Covid patients, 6 of which are for patients in critical condition and 39 are caring for seriously ill patients and for infected people over the age of 65. Two makeshift hospitals with 2,600 beds were built within a short time. 80% of the infected have mild disease, ten temporary hospitals were set up in gymnasiums and exhibition halls for those.

China can now produce 1.6 million test kits for the novel coronavirus per week. The test delivers a result on the same day. Across the country, anyone who goes to the doctor with a fever is screened for the virus: In Guangdong province, far from Wuhan, 320,000 people have been tested, and 0.14% of those were positive for the virus.

The vast majority of those infected sooner or later develop symptoms. Cases of people in whom the virus has been detected and who do not have symptoms at that time are rare - and most of them fall ill in the next few days.

The most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%). Exhaustion (38%), expectoration of mucus when coughing (33%), shortness of breath (18%), sore throat (14%), headaches (14%), muscle aches (14%), chills (11%) are also common. Less frequent are nausea and vomiting (5%), stuffy nose (5%) and diarrhoea (4%). Running nose is not a symptom of Covid.

An examination of 44,672 infected people in China showed a fatality rate of 3.4%. Fatality is strongly influenced by age, pre-existing conditions, gender, and especially the response of the health care system. All fatality figures reflect the state of affairs in China up to 17 February, and everything could be quite different in the future elsewhere.

Healthcare system: 20% of infected people in China needed hospital treatment for weeks. China has hospital beds to treat 0.4% of the population at the same time - other developed countries have between 0.1% and 1.3% and most of these beds are already occupied with people who have other diseases. The most important thing is firstly to aggressively contain the spread of the virus in order to keep the number of seriously ill Covid patients low and secondly to increase the number of beds (including material and personnel) until there is enough for the seriously ill. China also tested various treatment methods for the unknown disease and the most successful ones were implemented nationwide. Thanks to this response, the fatality rate in China is now lower than a month ago.

Pre-existing conditions: The fatality rate for those infected with pre-existing cardiovascular disease in China was 13.2%. It was 9.2% for those infected with high blood sugar levels (uncontrolled diabetes), 8.4% for high blood pressure, 8% for chronic respiratory diseases and 7.6% for cancer. Infected persons without a relevant previous illness died in 1.4% of cases.

Age: The younger you are, the less likely you are to be infected and the less likely you are to fall seriously ill if you do get infected:

table placeholder 

Read: Of those infected in China, 8.1% were between 20 and 29 years old (this does not mean that 8.1% of people between 20 and 29 become infected). Of those infected in this age group, 0.2% died.

Gender: Women catch the disease just as often as men. But only 2.8% of Chinese women who were infected died from the disease, while 4.7% of the infected men died. The disease appears to be not more severe in pregnant women than in others. In 9 examined births of infected women, the children were born by caesarean section and healthy without being infected themselves. The women were infected in the last trimester of pregnancy. What effect an infection in the first or second trimester has on embryos is currently unclear as these children are still unborn.

The new virus is genetically 96% identical to a known coronavirus in bats and 86-92% identical to a coronavirus in pangolin. Therefore, the transmission of a mutated virus from animals to humans is the most likely cause of the appearance of the new virus.

Since the end of January, the number of new coronavirus diagnoses in China has been steadily declining (shown here as a graph) with now only 329 new diagnoses within the last day - one month ago it was around 3,000 a day. ""This decline in COVID-19 cases across China is real,"" the report says. The authors conclude this from their own experience on site, declining hospital visits in the affected regions, the increasing number of unoccupied hospital beds, and the problems of Chinese scientists to recruit enough newly infected for the clinical studies of the numerous drug trials. Here is the relevant part of the press conference about the decline assessment.

One of the important reasons for containing the outbreak is that China is interviewing all infected people nationwide about their contact persons and then tests those. There are 1,800 teams in Wuhan to do this, each with at least 5 people. But the effort outside of Wuhan is also big. In Shenzhen, for example, the infected named 2,842 contact persons, all of whom were found, testing is now completed for 2,240, and 2.8% of those had contracted the virus. In Sichuan province, 25,493 contact persons were named, 25,347 (99%) were found, 23,178 have already been examined and 0.9% of them were infected. In the province of Guangdong, 9,939 contacts were named, all found, 7,765 are already examined and 4.8% of them were infected. That means: If you have direct personal contact with an infected person, the probability of infection is between 1% and 5%.

Finally, a few direct quotes from the report:

""China’s bold approach to contain the rapid spread of this new respiratory pathogen has changed the course of a rapidly escalating and deadly epidemic. In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history. China’s uncompromising and rigorous use of non-pharmaceutical measures to contain transmission of the COVID-19 virus in multiple settings provides vital lessons for the global response. This rather unique and unprecedented public health response in China reversed the escalating cases in both Hubei, where there has been widespread community transmission, and in the importation provinces, where family clusters appear to have driven the outbreak.""

""Much of the global community is not yet ready, in mindset and materially, to implement the measures that have been employed to contain COVID-19 in China. These are the only measures that are currently proven to interrupt or minimize transmission chains in humans. Fundamental to these measures is extremely proactive surveillance to immediately detect cases, very rapid diagnosis and immediate case isolation, rigorous tracking and quarantine of close contacts, and an exceptionally high degree of population understanding and acceptance of these measures.""

""COVID-19 is spreading with astonishing speed; COVID-19 outbreaks in any setting have very serious consequences; and there is now strong evidence that non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce and even interrupt transmission. Concerningly, global and national preparedness planning is often ambivalent about such interventions. However, to reduce COVID-19 illness and death, near-term readiness planning must embrace the large-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures. These measures must fully incorporate immediate case detection and isolation, rigorous close contact tracing and monitoring/quarantine, and direct population/community engagement.""",1583084963.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,17,38

219,"Did Indian government lose the Afghanistan plot entirely now that US and Taliban are about to have a peace deal?Modi government spent billions into Afghanistan to woo their present government (building parliament, dams, etc) and openly condemning Taliban as a terrorist organization instead of being neutral

Now US and Taliban are making a peace deal and it is very like that after the withdrawal of troops, Afghanistan is about to become a shitshow. It is very like that Taliban will overthrow the present government by force. If it does, then all of our diplomatic efforts to woo the present government go to waste.

Modi requested Trump to ask Qatar to invite India as a witness to the Peace Talks to save some face (imagine all the work done in Afghanistan and not even being invited lol). Since this deal does not involve the current government of Afghanistan in talks between US and Taliban, India is sending its envoy as a 'Observer' and not as a Member (our government is still stubborn to accept Taliban as a legitimate authority)

Did India just lost the Afghanistan plot completely? To me it seems so.

224,"Persecuted MinoritiesCAA is going to take care of the persecuted minorities of other countries, but what about the persecution of Indian minorities? What is the Home Minister going to do about it? What is the Prime Minister going to do about it? Amit Shah said in the Lok Sabha while defending the bill that Muslims need not be afraid. Really? After what happened in Delhi do you think Muslims are in a happy wonderland? Is this the India that he wants persecuted minorities from other countries to seek refuge in? Is this the New India which Modi pictured? If Modi or Shah really cared about Indians and their security, they would do something about it. How can not people see through this facade of a government? 42 people died. 42. We are a country of 1.37 billion people, but when even a single person dies due to incidents such as these, it may not effect other people like you and me, but it sure does effect the network of people that person was associated with. 42 may seem a small number but it is not. He may be some family's sole earner who toiled to make a home which someone burned down in a day. Like him there must be 41 others.

It saddens me to my core that we are a country which is capable of being a superpower of the world, but are stuck with the answer that it was Nehru's fault all along. Our education system is still in the 20th century, corruption is so deep rooted into the system that it is the system, our environment is degrading day by day and pollution of all sorts, be it air, noise or land. I know some of you people will bash me by saying what about this policy or that policy. Please look around first. Making policies is easy, executing them is hard. Who will do that? How many policies are executed properly, and of those which are executed, who compares the before and after status? 

So instead of focussing towards bringing more people to the country without requiring to submit proper documents, focus on improve the state of our nation. No one is going to do it for us, we are the ones who have to fix this. Before emoting towards persecuted minorities of other countries, first look into what our own people are going through.

271,"How 2002 has come of age in 2020.I had written an article on the status quo but was pretty scared (yes) to post it online. Sharing it with you all here. 

One could say that a nation gingerly determines its priorities and it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that the level of discourse we’ve chosen for ourselves (or has been chosen for us) woefully resembles that of 1992 and 2002. It should also be noted that 2002 has come of age in 2020, both literally and metaphorically and the latter shall continue to haunt us while the former shall cease to exist as did the FIR’s in hate speech cases. 


A particular slogan has been normalized faster than LGBTQ rights. While I wouldn’t be able to quote it in verbatim (neither do I want to), you already know what I’m referring to even if you’ve been casually perusing the news. 


One such perusal, though not of the newspaper but of Youtube led me to a particular clip from 2012 (too many 2’s). While the clip showed Kashmiri separatist Syed Ali Shah Geelani being heckled by students in the lanes of North Delhi’s Civil Lines, what caught my attention was the slogan being hurled. Let’s address the slogan of 2020 with a euphemism - goli seems alright. What the slogan of 2012 did was replace the goli with chappal while keeping the former part intact and the invective too! 


While certain pessimists tend to question the ruling dispensation on its economic prowess, here’s an apt example to show that we’ve certainly upped the ante from chappals to golis. My biased calculations also indicate that if one chooses the most economical option, one can purchase 5 chappals with the amount that would be spent on a desi gun ( assuming that a gun is required to fire a goli). Even if the GDP doesn’t become 5 times of 1, something else has. ",1583087235.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,1,25

304,"An account of what happened today in Patel Nagar, New DelhiSo I was at the park, playing football with friends and my brother was with me too.

I received a call from my parents.

I was like ""Hm? That's unusual"".

My father said ""don't come home right now"", I thought ah so we are eating out tonight, eh? He continued ""go to <insert friend's name>'s house, it's danger over here"". My mother took the phone and said ""riots have broken here, go to safety IMMEDIATELY"".

As soon as I cancelled my call, my friend received the same call from his parents (he lives very near), we hopped onto his scooter and made it to his home.

On the way I saw every fucking store getting its shutters down and people running here and there, panicking.

His mother was standing outside asking the society gaurds to keep the gates shut.
His father was out in the market and so
his sister lost her shit and was crying.

We were standing on the street and the neighborhood gathered and everyone had something to say:

""that cross-section had knives swung""

""people are beating everyone below the metro station""

and stuff like that.

His father returned safe and his account is a valuable one. He said ""I saw a pack running down the street, everyone was screaming ""Muslims are coming!!"" and all the shops started shutting down as they saw them passing"".

I started hearing conflicting accounts, everyone claimed that somewhere riots are going on so it seemed like every part of the area has them. My conspiracy theorist brain already figured out where the plot is going.

I called up my parents and asked them ""have you *seen* the riots?"". They said that they had only seen the panic, people came running and shops started shutting down.

I concluded ""there aren't any real riots here"".

His father's account helped evidence my explanation. How? Well, Bhakts want to believe Muslims are the ones behind the riots, this will create enough propaganda for people to really start believing it. 

Later my father came to pick me and my brother up. On the way back, I saw a shop still open and a lot of people standing outside. The guy in the very front said ""Don't you have any shame? Why is your shop still open?"" and some people were recording it. I think they are almost definitely the government goons who were spreading this rumour like fire and wanted to achieve maximum panic.

This all happened near 9 PM. The DCP has already given a statement confirming that there were indeed no riots but people have already believed the other, spicier narrative anyways.

At this pace, their dream of Hindu nation isn't that far.

So yeah, this is all. The absolute state of this country is depressing.

How when he was looking for partners to play Badminton, most hindu groups didn't take him in but the Muslim guys welcomed him with open arms. How he is welcome into their homes where other men cannot go, (meaning they consider like a family member). So when he told me all this, I expected he will have empathy towards the sufferings of the Muslims since he is close to so many. 

But as you'd have guessed by now, he was a Modi supporter with strong distrust towards Muslims. Although he claimed he is not against them (proof that he has so many close Muslim friends) but he felt they are extremely fanatic (kattar). I kept asking have they ever forced you or anyone to do anything against their wish. If not how can they be fanatic. Whatever their problems it is within their community. He strongly believes Muslims have 'enjoyed' the appeasement politics for many years and got so many benefits. How they want to have 4-5 kids to increase their population. He felt all Muslims should have gone to Pakistan during partition. You know, the usual stuff.

If this is how someone who has close Muslim friends thinks, then what can we say about the majority who have very little connection with Muslims. Every day, every conversation just goes onto solidify my belief that it is impossible to overcome this hate. We will either go the Germany way or the Israel way. Either way the future is not looking good.

TLDR: Met a friend who has close Muslim friends but still hates muslims.",1583077222.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,175,268
308,"Democracy, Dystopia, DJ Khaled.&#x200B;

(This piece draws reference from Leon Trotsky, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Robin Dunbar and the reincarnation of Descartes DJ Khaled)

A lot of good friends, peers and relatives of mine voted for BJP. 

Are they all bigots? Or are they simply unaware of the ground reality? 

Yes. 

The answer lies within today’s economy and consumption patterns. My car is from Uber, my house is from Air BnB, my office space is from WeWork. Our consumption patterns today depict the true essence of human life which at its centre is very chaotic. ln a truly chaotic environment like this how do we still have a governance system in place that has been going on for ages? Every day humanity grows increasingly chaotic and our systems in place simply don’t account for the anomalies but instead sweep it under the rug quietly because its stakeholders are constantly at war with each other (this is a metaphor, maybe) due to which the society at large loses its ability to perceive threats.

The relationship between the bourgeoisie and its basic social support, the petty bourgeoisie, does not at all rest upon reciprocal confidence and pacific collaboration. In its mass, the petty bourgeoisie is an exploited and disenfranchised class. It regards the bourgeoisie with envy and often with hatred. The bourgeoisie, on the other hand, while utilizing the support of the petty bourgeoisie, distrusts the latter, for it very correctly fears its tendency to break down the barriers set up for it from above.

This constant reinforcement of Us v/s Them in the human society coupled with an education system that deducts marks of a child based on the number of steps in a math problem which is by the way extremely reductive of what the child has understood magnifies into socially and politically illiterate adults. Voila, we now have an intelligent, capable human mind that exists in an echo chamber. It now only identifies itself with those that look alike or are from the same clan. It can't bridge the gap between its own truth and the reality of others. It forms its own image by looking at others. That’s its perceived reality.

To explain the concept of perceived reality, I will quote one of the greatest shows of all time, Neon Genesis Evangelion:

*Imagine a world with no boundaries.*

*This is the world with nothing, the space with nothing,*

*the world with nothing.*

*The world with nothing but me.*

*I can’t understand myself.*

*I feel as if I am going to disappear.*

*My existence is fading away.*

*Why?*

*Because there's nobody but you*

*Because you have no existence but of yourself, You can't figure out your own shape.*

*My shape?*

*My image.*

*Yes. You are getting to know your own shape through seeing others' shape.*

*Seeing others, you imagine yourself.*

*You cannot see yourself unless there are others.*

*Because there are others, I can exist.*

*If alone, I am always alone at anywhere.*

*The world is entirely by my ..*

*By cognizing the difference between you and others,*

*you form the image of yourself.*

That was weird no? Lol, after giving you that existential crisis, I’m going to talk about a little something called the Dunbar’s number. 

A study conducted on monkeys by a group of scientists confirmed that most monkeys operate in troupes of 50 or so. 


The Monkeysphere is the group of people who each of are able to conceptualize as people. A comparatively larger brain of a human being limits this number to 150 on an average. 

We do not have room in our Monkeysphere for our friendly neighborhood sanitation worker. So, we don't think of him as a person. We think of him as The Thing That Makes The Trash Go Away.

This greatly reduces the human ability of perceiving threat. Right now Corona virus has the threat of causing a world wide pandemic. However, people refuse to take any precautions because the people affected are outside of their monkey spheres.

""*One death is a tragedy. One million deaths is a statistic*.""

\-Joseph Stalin

Look at India for instance.

How long did it take for everyone to simply forget Pulwama? The main accused in Pulwama just got bail because NIA forgot to file a chargesheet and the people who were baying for war with Pakistan when Pulwama happened are not to be seen anywhere. Why aren’t we angry? We should be! There should be a nationwide outrage judging from the way people didn’t mind sending our soldiers to their deaths when Pulwama happened. What happened here? Are we insensitive? No we’re desensitised. 

We just forgot (shrugs). 

This leads to a system with many cracks in it forced together somehow by the industrial glue of governance and military. Modern art.

That’s precisely how all kinds of ideologies are allowed to co-exist because we just tend to sweep everything under the rug till it rots and the stench becomes unbearable. 

That’s how BJP came into power; people simply forgot about their past and their RSS roots.

In a world like this, the stronger narrative prevails no matter how unethical or morally disgusting it is.

You don’t have to convince everybody, just plant the idea in a single individual in a monkey sphere and watch it spread because every individual personality will tend to mimic their aides. Ever noticed how when engaging with different types of people your behaviour changes? The way you speak, your accent, how liberal and outspoken you are. The way you are with your parents is not the same way you behave with your friends. Even in the case of your friends circle, how men behave when women are around and how they behave when they aren’t also differs to a greater degree.

I read this beautiful para in a piece by Dr. Nassim Nicholas Taleb, it said, “*Let us conjecture that the formation of moral values in society doesn’t come from the evolution of the consensus. No, it is the most intolerant person who imposes virtue on others precisely because of that intolerance*”. In an environment like this, the stronger narrative wins. BJP wasn’t voted in because the majority of the country is xenophobic, it’s simply because they had a stronger narrative because of the said intolerance.

That is why the society always tends to repeat itself in patterns. The people, faces and names change but the patterns always repeat because instead of correcting we just tend to push the problems within the society to the margins, where no one can see them, where they are allowed to consolidate and as soon as there are power vacuums visible these forces latch on to them, feed on them and grow bigger like a parasite.

World War II was considered to be a war against fascism, the allies won and yet fascism resurfaces again. 

The fascist movement in Italy was a spontaneous movement of large masses, with new leaders from the rank and file. It is a plebian movement in origin, directed and financed by big capitalist powers. It issued forth from the petty bourgeoisie, the slum proletariat, and even to a certain extent from the proletarian masses; Mussolini, a former socialist, a man of the masses (Hum toh fakeer insaan hain, jholi lekar chal padenge) is a ""self-made"" man arising from this movement (eerily similar to the chaiwala narrative). 

The movement in Germany was analogous mostly to the Italian. It is a mass movement, with its leaders employing a great deal of socialist demagogy (acche din aanewale hain). This is necessary for the creation of the mass movement against the autocrats (in India’s case the narrative built against Congress and Gandhis calling them dynasts, when more than half of BJP politicians are dynasts themselves). 

And that’s how we are here in 2020 watching history repeat itself in front of us as if it’s 2002. 

How do we fix something like this? We can always wait for the virus to infiltrate every monkey sphere and wait for people perceive it as a threat and when everything is well, we’ll just forget to remember?

Or 

We do what Nelson Mandela did when he ended Apartheid in South Africa.

If we look into similar events throughout history, the end of apartheid slavery should’ve been a revolution of the masses ending in a massive bloodbath but that’s not what happened. Mandela and his team realised that when a system is corrupt everyone that is a part of the system is a victim. 

“If you stick a knife in my back nine inches and pull it out six inches, there's no progress. If you pull it all the way out that's not progress. Progress is healing the wound that the blow made. You won’t even accept there’s a knife” - Malcolm X.

A cattle dealer once drove some bulls to the slaughterhouse. And the butcher came night with his sharp knife.

""Let us close ranks and jack up this executioner on our horns,"" suggested one of the bulls. 

""If you please, in what way is the butcher any worse than the dealer who drove us hither with his cudgel?"" replied the bulls, who had received their political education in Manuilsky's institute. \[The Comintern\]

""But we shall be able to attend to the dealer as well afterwards!""

""Nothing doing,"" replied the bulls firm in their principles, to the counselor. ""You are trying, from the left, to shield our enemies -- you are a social-butcher yourself.""

319,"Need advice for work politicsKeeping it as short as I can. Please bear with me. 

I worked in a company for three years while I was approached by the current one. They persuaded me a lot to join and casually agreed to work on my terms. Lately, I was pushed into leading the domain I didnt sign up for. I was hired as the head of business development in terms of building relations. However, I have been pushed into being sales head. Given this shift and constant salary delays, I have been meaning to quit but decided to give it a couple more months 

But what followed recently was a shocker when my HR out of nowhere calls and tells me that they dont want me to continue. I was extremely furious with management as they directly persuaded me but chose to tell me through HR without even intimating about any issue. 

Upon further discussion with my COO, it turns out that it wasn't my performance or work, which they thankfully are very content with. It was coworkers saying shit about me that led him to assume and believe that I am degrading the office culture which was a shocker to me. 


Few points on the topic - 

1. My colleagues came to me with a work problem in hysterical and stressed states. 

For ex, I feel underpaid and stuff. To which I gave the suggestion to compile the work and highlight your skills and then have a one on one meeting with hr and management to justify the raise. 

This was portrayed to my management as me trying to demotivate people and pushing them to ask for raise. 


2. My CEO asked my HR to validate. She never spoke to me and gave me the reason as performance based issues for firing. Further told my CEO that she has validated the same with everyone else in the company and based on this he decided to let me go. 


3. I am the last person to gossip and been very out front in terms of my opinions. 



Have a discussion with my CEO tomorrow. Can anyone shed some light on how to deal with this. He doesn't want me to leave in terms of work but doesn't want a ""negative source"" in his team.

417,"Am I kinda delusional for still feeling horrible about my 11th and 12th?This is kind of a weird post. And it's very self indulgent, especially given the mess going on in our country....but I think about it so often.

As a student, my academic record has been nearly perfect. From 1 to 10th and First Year to Third Year (I graduated 6 months ago). But my 11th and 12th was... Rough.

Was always an arts guy, was passively forced into science. This is quite common for many people in CBSE/ our country, but when I think about it, I still really feel bad. Like it makes my internal machinations just... Ache. A lot of things were going on (a family member was hospitalized all through my boards, and he passed 4 days later) but still. It's not like I was doing well in PCM before that. I managed to transfer to a good/better college directly after my first year year (because I topped my FY by a huge margin) but I still... I don't know. 

I know it's all in the past now, move on etc etc but it will always hurt me. I liked sciences too, but by the end it mutated into something else entirely. People kinda assume I was one of those douche-y, clueless arts kids all my life but I loved science, but my marks, ESPECIALLY in mathematics, will never reflect that.

 Does anyone relate to this? Or am I just a person who holds on to misery forever? (I do think I do, but that's a different topic). No joke I was honestly looking/discussing ways to ""re-do"" my 11th-12th through NIOS, lmao.",1583019187.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,15
418,"Second innings.“Etherized upon a table” an invalid waited for the surgeon’s knife. Its vitals were to be removed, organs excavated, incisions made, limbs uprooted and its future rethought. In a stuffy room in a sultry land a white, balding, fat man pranced nervously gazing at its patient stretched and pinned on a dusty table. What will it be? Gashes had to be made, lines had to be drawn that was pre-ordained. But based on what? In a room filled with incensed ancestors and scrolls the worn map lay sprawled. Lines would be drawn it seemed based on something truly lofty, food habits. As the fat, sweaty surgeon peered over the map a drop of sweat fell from his perplexed brows, fuzzing up a line and the fate of millions. 

If you are partial towards cows you remained on one side of the gash, and if you had a disliking for pigs or a love for Beef nihari you remained on the other side. The sweaty white surgeon laid down his tools, pencils, pens, chalk, and a ruler. These were now to determine the fate of millions. Sir *Ratcliff* with a bloated face and receding hairline measured the incision one more time, weighed out the odds yet another time.

Cow lovers and Pig haters had to be separated, they couldn’t possibly dwell together. He took a long greedy gulp from his glass of whiskey and then peered into the piss like liquid for some profound revelation. He drew his lines like an obedient convent educated girl. The poor rat surgeon had been commissioned to perform the operation, on completion he fled. The land of the cow lovers and the land of the pig haters had now been designated. 

The sojourn had begun only there was no Moses to lead them on, and no Promised Canaan waiting, only the promise of a broken home, and a fragmented land. A patient who had been promised treatment but had been severed limb from limb lay groaning and bloody. The pilgrims saw no line, just heard an ominous announcement. Lands had developed affiliations. They hadn't known rocks and stones could do that, but suddenly dirt had religion, it either favored cows or didn’t. Hence the sojourners would have to pick up their pots and pans and their animal affiliations and play a game of Chinese Checkers.

The Saffron toucans that found themselves on the wrong side of the line would have to abandon their nests, pick their hatchlings up and migrate to the land of the cow lovers and the green parrots would have to see themselves into the land of the cow eaters. Many were lost on the way. The toucans fought the parrots with a false sense of pride, because they were asked to. 

Only yesterday a parrot hatchling had played with a toucan chick. But today as the rat surgeon fled dirt had affiliations and religion. The game was played, the untimely migration over. Many lay dead, toucans and parrots, cow lovers and pig haters the vultures feasted, the rat man had fled with his pens and rulers. 

Years have passed the amputated woman is back on the table. It is yet again a “patient etherized upon a table”. Only this time there is no commissioned rat to tear her limb from limb, she is already an amputee. But, the spirit of the line drawer has now possessed yet another surgeon a “Saffron Parakeet” with an amazingly broad chest and an appalling small heart. The old game of Chinese Checkers will be played again. The unwitting participants have lined up, waiting for a faceless voice to sound. They are waiting to hate again, migrate again.

491,"Why do Indians not eat beef?Me and my friends in college in the US are of Indian descent and during dinner yesterday and interesting debate came across us. One of my friends argued that Indians don't eat beef because of Hinduism, but the other argued that originally Indians don't eat beef due to associating the cow with a mother. This debate carried on for an hour and no real consensus was reached. 

Growing up I was always taught that cows were a sacred animal and that they should not be eaten.

My friends are still debating this today and we thought that r/india, would be a great place to get the opinion of many Indians.

523,"Should I quit my ""Data Analyst"" internshipI'm an economics graduate(graduated in 2018) and I'm learning coding since 2019. I know good level of python. It's ML libraries, took a course in Machine Learning by Andrew NG and now I'm learning some backend web framework(just to do something). So, I've been applying since January and recently got a ""Data analyst"" job. But, that job requires meeting with clients and software customization and it's 9 hours, 6 days of work! The role isn't much technical and requires some weird software to do analysis if some analytics comes up in the first place. Most of my friends said that that's how internships are like and just hustle through, you'll get a tech role eventually. Also, I have a really hard time finding internship and I know it's gonna be rough if I quit this one. On the other hand, I may get a better role if I complete this 3 months internship but I won't be able to update my tech stack. I'm really confused as to what should I do.",1582981989.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,25,10

563,"What exactly is the BJP trying to do here?I have been following their moves closely. Right from 2013 and the Anna Hazare days - you got to say that the overall scheme was very well planned. 

They played the Economy card well and came into power. And then things changed as we all know. 

2019 was non-apologetic Anti-Muslim Hindu-rashtra narrative and still they won quite handsomely. 

But what is it that they are trying to do now? They have won the elections, they have a massive strength to do anything in the house and they need not divide people for at least another 3+ years. Yet why do they keep brining up stupid laws?

Surely, unlike the average WhatsApp Hindu, the BJP isn't naive enough to think that Hindus will become minority in India. 

So what is their endgame here? 

1. If winning elections is the endgame, I think they are already doing a pretty good job of it. So I don't see any reason why they have to put in more effort. 

2. Establishing a Hindu State is not going to happen. They cannot in any reasonable state of mind think that they can pull that off. 

3. We have 200 MILLION Muslims. So it's not like you can get rid off them because you feel like it.

And AAP, a party which had hetherto raised issues only pertaining to development and education will be forced into this Hindu Muslim debate as well. A debate which is impossible to win against BJP.

My brother will be graduating this June. He will be completing his B.Pharm from an average college, in Dehradun. So far, only one company has visited his campus for placements and he didn’t sit for its interview as the offer was too low(1.5 lpa CTC IIRC). There is no news of any other companies. He’s an average student.

What options does he have? MPharm from a good college is out of the question since he didn’t qualify GPAT 2020. What I wanna ask is what options does a pharma graduate have? What is the pharma job market like?

When I just casually searched on naukri.com, majority of the jobs were of MR(medical representative) and medical coding. Medical coding didn’t even particularly require BPharm, a few companies had written UG in any discipline as their requirement. Are there no research oriented jobs in the pharma field? What companies are those which don’t come for an MR or market business associate type job? I have nothing against these jobs, I just want to know what all paths can the career of a pharma graduate take. And what skills should a candidate’s resume have to bag those offers?

I answered it then but felt a bit odd after the interview. **I mean what purpose does it serve? How did it help the hiring manager to get to know me better?**

I have heard that asking about family background is illegal in some western countries, is it?

825,"#Urgent Heavy Mobilization needed at Shaheen BaghHindu Sena has given a call to clear Shaheen Bagh again.

Last time they tried the same on 2nd Feb but a massive crowd reached Shaheen Bagh and they had to call off their plan.

This time again they have again issued a warning to clear Shaheen Bagh & If you are staying in New Delhi or nearby areas please reach Shaheen Bagh today, tomorrow and day after tomorrow ""at least""... They have issued a warning for the 1st of March i.e. Tomorrow.

These goons are confident after all the mess they have created in New Delhi. More ~~Hindus~~ goons will join them because during these riots a lot of fake news was being spread that Muslims have created this chaos and they are slaughtering the Hindus.

During the riots, some people were going in localities and they gave speeches like ""We Hindus have to unite. This is getting out of control"", Whereas, on the other hand, A lot of people have also realized the value of Secularism, People from every community have also supported the victims.

I think Delhi has seen enough Bloodshed for this century and it's time that everyone should unite now to stop this mayhem before it again gets out of control.

Right now, there are multiple reports of Hindu Sena volunteers doing a rally in Hindu areas and using their only slogan ""Desh k gaddoron.....""

I think it's enough now, If you are still quiet then don't think for a second that you are on the side of Humanity, the blood is on your hands as well.

***If the deaf are to hear, the sound has to*** ***be very*** ***loud - Bhagat Singh***

# Shaheen Bagh- Tomorrow!

835,"It is over! We are moments away from a failed state.While the government keeps marginalizing the minority to win elections, they have completely given up on managing the nation. We had an ecosystem which could handle a lot, but even that is thinning out. While all of this is happening a lot of farmers are being duped by lack of governmental policies, specifically the apathy of the government over impending climate crisis, problems which will never be highlighted in the mass media. The reports of mgnrega are disturbing, what has been happening in NE is disturbing. There is a locust swarm at the doors on the NW which will soon take out a lot of yield that feeds the nation, while a lot of people haven't even heard of operation dolphin's nose. 

Slowly but surely the bad economics will start catching up. All the voices quelled, will start gaining traction. At some point people will start feeling the brunt of shitty governance. Majority, that enjoys privilege and are sheltered from all of this violence and hate mongering, will start feeling the pinch where it hurts them the most, loss in earnings. People who have broken the glass ceiling and moved into middle class will slowly creep back to poverty, and that is when they will start (or try to start) agitating. NRIs have already forsaken their souls, now they will have even more valid reasons to say 'yeh India ka kuch nahi ho sakta, accha hua hum bhag aye' without ever realising their privilege. I have a turkish friend who told me the despair of moderates and liberals in his country, he said he has given up, I believe a lot of Indians will follow the suit! Those who can escape will escape (I believe they should escape) while the others left behind will face the despair and atrocities because they were ""born"" poor/muslim/dalit. 

We are on track for becoming a failed state, another middle-east (if you may). This is it I believe, it took us only a generation to prove the britishers right! 

I grew up in a household that revered Shivaji and Gandhi and it sucks that I despair instead of being inspired. But the thing is, they fought external forces while we are fighting our own. And there is very less historical evidence of the right triumphing when the forces fighting it are internal. 

Anyway, as I sit here in a cold winter afternoon in a western country, the irony is not lost on me that I am also the part of the problem! But all I could do is mount a fickle resistance on reddit and twitter, try and avoid coming face to face with the Goliath, as I am no David who can take him on. 

My heart yearns for the youth of the country who are standing up against the atrocities. I have nothing but respect for you beautiful folks on r/India for keeping the agitation alive. And I am afraid for everyone on twitter who are speaking out boldly, without the fear for life and limb. The reporters who are fighting the fight, while facing real threats. Press has more safety on Gaza strip than Delhi these days! 

I wish (desperately) to see a leader, a front, that can claim a legitimate, sustained revolution without being adulterated by hidden agendas. A Gandhi if I may, who can walk to the doorsteps of this evil, unarmed but determined!

How should I negotiate to get best offer without fear of losing the job.  (also add other things I should definately discuss with the HR before joining apart from insurance, WFH policy, annual salary hike, off days)

&#x200B;

I cleared all rounds of a good startup company in a metro city . The next round is of talks with HR manager regarding salary, perks.  After a bit of research , The post I am offered fetches between 6-12LPA (CTC or take home isn't mentioned).

I really love this position &  I want to have the job. Also, since I would be moving to such an expensive city, a good offer would really help me.

How should I negotiate, also since this will be my first job would I even be given window to negotiate?

I will make sure to negotiate on 'take home' salary, but how should I walk the talk safely.

I've to go to the US tomorrow for a week and leave my wife and 5 month old son behind. I'm kinda scared for them. I know things have settled down just a bit but I don't trust the environment right now. Since no one has been able to stop the state and/or the goons, I feel things can go real bad any time. 

&#x200B;

We are Muslim (atheist really but that doesn't matter in this case) and I'm quite scared for their life. Am I being paranoid? If things so wrong, they have no way of getting out to protecting themselves. I know there is only like a 0.1% chance of something happening but the cost we'd have to pay if it happens is just too much.   


Am I  being too paranoid? Do you think South Delhi in general is safer and I should go for a week? My wife's brower lives in Okhla (Zakir Nagar). Should I send them there for a week instead?   


I feel like it's more likely for the violence to break out in Okhla because of Shaheen Bagh but it is also kinda safer as rioters generally don't enter a heavily Muslim majority area.

> Good bass, I watch action movies, so I need the rumbling bass when helicopters fly by in scenes [ Sennheiser 215ii had this, but 6 years later they are 7.5k, out of my budget even after 6 years 😔 used to be 4k]

> Good wire quality and length [minimum 1.5 m]. I lean back or sleep on bed away from computer to watch movies, so I need good thick single wire coming out of one end like audio Technica [ wire quality is one thing I hate in Sennheiser, they become dry and cut cut after few months] also shood withstand all my twisting and yogasana while I watch.

> Good sound quality, basically I want m20x [20x to 50x, same sound only, I've used] but with actual bass.

> Must be over the ear (circum-aural) headphones . This is very **IMPORTANT** . I do not want on ear (supra-aural) , I don't know why they are even a thing, honestly.

Optional:

> Mic, it would be nice but not compulsory
> wireless, I prefer analog, but, if wireless is the best option, I'll take it
> Black color
> Detachable cable
> Case
> Braided cable

1094,"After Taapsee and Anubhav Sinha's support to Anti-CAA protest, BJP supporters are trying their best to make Thappad flop.\#BoycottThappad is trending on Twitter.

Messages to boycott Thappad are being circulated in Whats App and Facebook.

BJP supporters are giving one star to Thappad on IMDB, Google and Bookmyshow

Links:

IMDB: [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10964430/ratings?ref\_=tt\_ov\_rt](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10964430/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt)

Google: [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=thappad](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&q=thappad)

Why should any actor or celebrity come out and show her / his support to protestors? Time and again it has been proven that supporting protestors only hurt their art. I just saw Thappad and it is an exceptionally good film. It hurts me to see such a good work being demeaned like this only because the makers supported an ideology. From World's largest democracy we are fast becoming World's largest authoritarian regime. Everyone has right to reject or accept an artist's work. But condemning an art, not because it is bad, but because the artist has a certain ideology, is awful and reflects where our society is heading. May the better sense prevail.

To those who have already spoken about it, I hope you have already found some help, To those, who feel that speaking about it publicly might ruin your image and people will judge you then I can assure that if you won't talk about this, It ~~can~~ will do more damage and people in this country are not wise enough yet to understand these issues and they will keep treating you the same and you will do some irreparable damage to yourself... 

One of the reasons why people are not able to understand these issue is that our Parents never came across these issues, YES, they had their fair share of problems but most of that was not mental, The amount of pressure we go through today is way more than what they have experienced, They will judge you based on their experiences, Talk to the right people who understand these things. Your feelings and emotions are valid.

If you have any mental issues feel free to drop a comment or text, I can assure you that whatever it is, you can get over it if you chose to. I had my fair share of depression in life and I can say that I've done catastrophic damage to myself mentally and physically to cope with that stress. It lasted for a period of 7-8 years as far as I can remember. So I can say that ""I know how it feels"", That's why I want to help you before it's too late.

Due to several reasons, I now have to drop out of my college and will be unable to complete a degree. I don't want to use any more of my parents' money because they have already paid several lakhs towards my education with nothing to show for it. I am willing to persue a corresponce degree from IGNOU or the likes so that I could later do an LLB degree.

My questions are:  
1) Can I take admission into another law college through a lateral transfer? I know other NLUs don't allow this but will other colleges like GLC or private colleges give me admission? Will I have to start from scratch?
2) I also have experience with Adobe Creative Suite. How difficult is it to land a small time gig doing graphic design work so that I could earn a little money in the time being?

Any kind of help would be appreciated. I feel very depressed as of now with no plan for my future. My parents aren't hostile but I don't want to be dependent on them any longer.",1582876472.0,,,dark,1,7

1185,"The intoxicated nation""Who are you to tell me if I should drink?"", he blurted it out and tried to sit up but then he slipped in his own urine and vomit and fell on it, splattering his regurgitated dinner all over the place. Blood was trickling down his forehead from a concussion he had a few minutes ago. The combined stench of urine, vomit and alcohol was as nauseating as was the blurred, confused, senseless look in my father's eyes. Only a fool reasons with an intoxicated person. This was nothing new in what has happened. He has fallen down on the road, injured himself, quarrelled with his wife, abused his children, got into an altercation with neighbours and fought with people under the influence of alcohol many times before. From dawn to dusk, his companion has been alcohol. No request, no pleading, no reasoning, no warning worked with him. Many times he even justified his addiction. Those justifications are hilarious - All those who drink are not dangerous, drinking calms the person, drinking helps in forgetting the pain, great artists and singers also drink, the soul has its own needs, etc. I tried, initially, to help my father get rid of his addiction. But I realized that one cannot help those who do not want to be helped. For him, we were his enemies trying to snatch his most cherished possession. I left him to his addiction, his bloodstained bed-sheet, his vomit and urine-filled floor, his bloated liver and his daily struggle to remain sane.

Alcohol is but just one of the intoxicants that destroy life. I disagree with Marx that religion is opium to mankind. Opium is not cheap and it is not available to everyone. Religion is a country liquor that is cheap and available at every street corner in India. There are more temples and mosques than the combined number of public toilets, railway stations, hospitals, schools, colleges and universities in India. It shows the priority of Indians. The priority of an Indian is to remain ignorant and deluded by drinking copious amount of religious nonsense with every gulp. Welcome to the dark land, a medieval country where people believe in whatever is there on thousands of years old books written by people as ignorant as they are. This adherence to ignorance is what they call their culture. No matter how much they are told that they are destroying their lives, the lives of their children and the country itself, just like my father, they say, ""Who are you to tell me if my religion is not good?"".

For sure religion gives people peace of mind but so does any narcotic. Religion assures people by giving silly answers of heaven and hell, gods and angels, judgement day, karma and rebirth to their questions about their existence. Religion makes them feel strong because they belong to a group of equally weak and insecure people. Religion gives them a community of idiots so that their idiocy is reinforced. Religion tells them that they will reach paradise or sit on the right-hand side of Jesus or they will be reborn as Brahmins. But for such petty gains, they ignore the mess that religion creates. When the defenders of religions wreck havoc, kill, rape, burn houses and shops, they give excuses and justifications. They force themselves to accept lies as truths and remain a faithful slave of the intoxicant called religion. They deflect questions or blame capitalism, socialism, secularism, feminism and just about everything, to defend their own lack of critical thinking. To me, India is a land of millions and millions of ignorant and unthinking people who are very proud of being idiot enough to write Brahmin or Jat or Kshatriya on the back of their cars or wake up people screaming Azaan at the top of their voices in loudspeakers or tell people that wearing Burka is woman's freedom.

It is so because even the greatest of India's sons did not dare to address the disease of religion that Indians suffer from. They either ignored it or repackaged it as spirituality and sold it to the world. The secularism that India adopted was a Band-Aid against the malignant tumour of religiosity and the resulting communalism. Secularism is a clear demarcation between state and faith. But in India, secularism means that one has to be coward enough to respect every religion. No other country accepts this ad hoc definition of secularism. Our penchant for respecting stupidity in the name of secularism has kept us both ignorant and uncivilized. We are idiots. We revere our stupidity, our silly gods, our meaningless rituals, the divine rewards and punishments that never arrive. Our religions have put us in different groups and segregated the people between us and them. This is why the Ram temple must be built. This is why Allahabad must be renamed to Prayagraj. This is why cows are not just animals. This is why 1984 happened. This is why 2002 happened. This is why 2020 happened and this is why every year there will be riots and pogroms. Every day the alcoholic will urinate and vomit and wipe his face with his own blood. Every day the alcoholic will justify his action. Every day the alcoholic will fail to see that the alcohol is killing him.

So long a person does not gather enough courage to acknowledge his enemy, he cannot defeat it. So long the people of India ignore the perils of organized religion or continue to justify religion, India will have riots, pogroms, massacres. Men will die, children will become orphans, women will become widows, leaders will incite violence, mosques will be razed and churches will be vandalized. No nation has survived the test of time. India won't either and its downfall is rapidly advancing. The only way to delay it is to bring people out of the outdated belief systems and to give them education. The only way to delay it is to make them civilized human beings from ignorant and barbarous religious animals. Else, the death of India will be as painful and humiliating as the end of my father was.",1582887002.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,34,21

 I don't just mean hate speech on religion but also hate speech that instigates violence against women that encourages behaviour that is not civilized.
To me any speech that normalises violent behaviour (e.g. the boys will be boys comment after rape/molestation cases) or instigates violence should be immediately investigated and suppressed. 
Maybe this will result in our free speech being curtailed for a while but that would be acceptable to be if it curtailed the acts of violence. 

Do the intolerant need to have a voice? Why are organizations (irrespective of religion, caste and creed) that preach lawlessness and hatred allowed to organise rallies? Isn't it time that we stop tolerating intolerance, that we raise our voices against these anti social elements?

She is the sole bread winner for her family & currently wants to reconstruct her house. She has a requirement of approximately Rs.2,00,000 to Rs.3,00,000.

I was thinking if there is a way she can get her self to be eligible for home loan somehow. 

A few things I have thought, 

1.) Take all the salary from the owners into nationalized bank account & show it as income.

2.) Since she does not have tax liability can she file returns on this income as proof ? Will she be able to generate PAN and link it to the account and then file returns based on her yearly income ?

3.) Since her income is not constant all year long - how can we regularize it so that bank can accept it for disbursing a loan.

I noticed some people hang some type of leaves from the top of their door frame. What is the meaning or symbolism behind this?

I also noticed many have what I assume to be tumeric and a red spice on the bottom of their door/entry. Some even have yellow/red/white spices/powders in a sort of pattern.

**Tl;dr**

IFF has responded to the call for public comments and suggestions by the Joint Committee on the Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill, 2019 and sent across a submission on behalf of the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. In it we have provided substantive inputs on essential privacy principles and a thematic analysis of major issues with the Bill. We have also appended a public brief containing a high-level clause by clause analysis of the Bill. Additionally, we have appended two issue specific briefs on (a) workplace surveillance and (b) the relationship between the PDP Bill and the National Population Register.   


**Essential First Principles**

As a first step we apprised the Committee that since the right to privacy as recognised by the Supreme Court also includes informational privacy this should be the primary lens through which the eventual law should be framed. In this regard, we also mentioned that the Supreme Court in the right to privacy judgement (*KS Puttaswamy v Union of India*) made the observation that the right to privacy subsists in public spaces as well. In this regard, we highlighted that a lot of users’ experiences online occur in certain corners of the internet which are public/semi-public in nature. Therefore, India’s data protection law must respect that and therefore accord adequate privacy protections in these domains  


In addition, we noted that the Joint Committee could shape India’s data protection law to incorporate the [**seven privacy principles**](https://saveourprivacy.in/principles) of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018 which was developed by the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign. These principles are based on the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in KS Puttaswamy v Union of India and global examples like the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation. The seven privacy principles emphasise that individual rights should be at the center of privacy and data protection and that the government should respect user privacy. They also address the need for the creation of a strong supervisory authority; and for surveillance reform.   


**Major Concerns that should be addressed by the Committee**

Subsequently we have done a thematic analysis of our top substantive concerns with the PDP Bill. This includes but is not limited to themes such as:  


*1.    Inclusion and treatment of social media intermediaries in the Bill*

The Bill requires social media platforms identified as “significant data fiduciaries” to set up infrastructure which allows users in India to voluntarily verify their accounts. This measure hampers online anonymity and thereby the right to privacy. Additionally, it will allow social media entities to access people's government issued identity documents. This can lead to aggregation of demographic information across different social media companies and databases. This creates immense scope for companies to build granular user profiles and commercialise personal and sensitive personal data of individuals. **We therefore ask the Committee to remove this provision from the PDP Bill**.  


*2.*   *Need for a chapter on surveillance reform*

Presently, India does not have sufficient privacy safeguards in place when it comes to surveillance carried out by the government. The frameworks currently in place (under India’s Information Technology Act and the Telegraph Act) are geared towards national security and fail to adequately protect privacy. In particular there is a lack of sufficient institutional or legislative oversight. **Thus, we have proposed that there is a need for a separate chapter on surveillance reform in the Bill along the lines of the Indian Privacy Code, 2018**.  


*3.*   *Exceptions for central government to access non-personal data*

A provision in the PDP Bill (Clause 91) provides a carve-out for the Central Government to access anonymised or non-personal data to frame policies in the interest of its digital economy. Such provisions show that the proposed law is far more interested in treating data as a resource. **We believe that a data protection law should not be used as a legislative backdoor to commodify data**.  


*4.   Issues with proposed structure of the Data Protection Authority (DPA) and the accompanying appellate structure*

* The selection committee consists of secretary-level officials. Two issues that arise here are of: i) accountability (these are neither democratically elected nor judicial members), and ii) diversity (it doesn’t reflect executive, judicial and external expertise). **Thus, we have proposed having an open call for applications and for the selection committee to have be inclusive in terms of representation**.
* We have noted that the Bill **impairs the independence of the DPA** by allowing the Government to frame policies which will be binding on them.
* To ensure quicker and localised decision making, we have proposed having **state and regional DPA benches**.
* We think that as things stand, the Appellate Tribunal would lack transparency. To that end, we have **proposed that it must publish all its decisions**.   


*5.*   *The “reasonable purposes” exemption which allows personal data to be processed without consent for reasonable purposes under Clause 14 of the Bill.*

The exemptions granted under this clause are fairly wide. It classifies publicly available personal data as under the “**reasonable purposes**” category. We think that this is a backdoor towards profiling and allow collation of demographic/individual sentiments on issues. We also think this would allow the government (and other powerful data fiduciaries) to aggregate social networking activities without the need for individual consent. The right to privacy is applicable in public spaces. Therefore, we proposed that this **provision be removed from the reasonable purposes exception since it is an excessive encroachment on people’s privacy in public spaces**.  


In addition to these themes, there are also other major issues with the Bill that we have discussed at length in our submission. The #SaveOurPrivacy collective has also authored briefs and explainers on different areas of the PDP Bill. We are sharing them with the JPC, the public and other relevant stakeholders in the hope that our analysis can inform future outcomes.

1305,"Data Protection and the National Population RegisterTl;dr

As part of its submission to the Joint Parliamentary Committee evaluating the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, IFF has sent a brief analysing the impact of the Bill on the National Population Register. The brief highlights how the National Population Register violates data protection principles of lawfulness, consent, purpose limitation, data minimization and accountability. Based on this case study, the brief identifies various loopholes in the Bill and recommends necessary changes.

### The Database Republic

https://preview.redd.it/g8k392ejmnj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=cbe02f58263c5f04b1e95acec3ec89408650b390

The National Population Register has been in the headlines during the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act but the project has a long and interesting history. Originally proposed in 2001 in the aftermath of the Kargil War to address concerns of cross-border infiltration, the project was accelerated after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks. Household surveys were conducted in 2010 for NPR, and demographic data, biometric data and other government identifiers were collected from the population. It is important to note biometrics and government identifiers are sensitive personal data and their misuse can cause significant harm to an individual.

While there was an initial tussle between UIDAI and the Registrar General over whose database will have primacy, this was resolved by the Cabinet Committee on UID in 2010 with the Government deciding that the Registrar General will issue Aadhaar cards instead of Multi-Purpose National Identity Cards. In 2015, NPR was updated and seeded with Aadhaar numbers. The Election Commission also wanted Voter ID details to be mandatorily included in NPR so it could link Voter IDs with Aadhaar through this mechanism. Earlier in 2011, NPR data was used as the basis for the Socio-Economic Caste Census because the Census Act, 1948 prohibited census data from being used. Therefore, NPR became the channel to achieve what could not be done through databases which had higher levels of data protection.

### Recommendations

We analysed the NPR project against data protection principles recognized by the Supreme Court in the landmark judgement of *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* and found that it fell short on several aspects.

https://preview.redd.it/jractwfpmnj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=682632a4d7910c2d579856b8ba2916598d5ba5c9

Based on this case study, we recommend the following changes should be made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 to fix loopholes which could lead to a disproportionate encroachment on individual privacy.

* Clause 5 of the PDP Bill should state that only those purposes which are clearly mentioned in the primary legislation enacted by Parliament will qualify as a valid purpose for collection and processing of personal data if the government is building a database. 
* Clause 35 of the PDP Bill should include principles of necessity and proportionality and mandate independent judicial oversight prior to any exemption being granted by the Central Government. This would also be consonant with the proportionality standard endorsed by the Supreme Court in *K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India (2017 10 SCC 1).* In any case, exemption from application of the entire PDP Bill should not be permitted and certain minimal requirements like preservation of quality and integrity of data and adherence to security standards should be required even under Clause 35.
* Clause 38 of the PDP Bill should be restructured and sub-clauses (d) and (e) should be incorporated as provisos which will serve as a pre-condition for grant of exemption for statistical purposes.

*(We are very grateful to Srinivas Kodali and Vrinda Bhandari for helping us with this brief.)*

1356,"[P]Why our narrative about CAA, NRC needs to changeAlmost all people skip the ToS. They aren't bothered by it. They make up their mind by giving the title/description just enough attention. If, by the gist of it,  something seems to be right, reading the ToS wont make change their mind.

What is CAA, NRC. Both are positive steps. Everyone should welcome it.

But the ToS is where the scheming autocrats sneak their wicked plans, which only the ones who are aware could detect it. The average person,  even if made to be aware, will be reluctant, or at best confused whether to go against their previous judgement.

Although the CAA doesn't actually hide what its for, the subheading is not everpresent in the public view.

When a thing seems good by the look of it, why would an average person probe further.

**So, the INITIAL REACTION:**  
**CAA, NRC. = positive, good** (grants citizenship,  census)  
**NO CAA, NO NRC= bad**  ( prohibiting  citizenship, prohibiting NRC)

**But, the NUANCED TAKE:  
CAA, NRC = could be used to disenfranchise  
NO CAA, NO NRC = right reaction to above.**

So, the actual CAA, NRC would look like     **CAA* , NRC***  
* **conditions apply**

**If the initial reaction is positive about CAA, NRC, why would one get into nuance?**

Heres what needs to be changed
Instead of rejecting CAA, NRC and being on the backfoot, we should promote it. 

**Change the gist of CAA, NRC of being good to being a flawed.**

Advocate:  
1) ""**Non-Discriminatory CAA**"" and you've introduced the idea that the original is discriminatory.

Similarly, NRC is modified, hence advocate for  
2) ""Unmodified NRC"". But that doesn't ring well. So maybe     
""**Untampered NRC**"". It puts doubt that the new one is tampered. 

By advocating these two, maybe, the onus would lie on the authorities to justify their act.

*IDK, Maybe its too late to put this here now, still just putting it up.
Not an expert. Infact I know very little. So Just my views.*


**TL;DR:** Advocate for ""Non-discriminatory CAA"" & ""Untampered NRC"" to instill the idea that the original is flawed and needs to change

*Edit: 2) Can be INCLUSIVE CAA, CONSTITUTIONAL CAA, etc.

They promote extremely fake news as well. This particular video says that Trump told Modi in hindi that ""Socho mat mere friend Modi, seedha thok do"" (T: Don't think about it Modi, just shoot them).

Things went out of control when Hindu rioters who were from outside came in mobs of 300 in several trucks and started pelting stones to the crowd in Jafarabad - Maujpur area who responded violently and when police came in between they were also beaten by Muslim rioters.
As the force was less , both group rioters were out of control. 

Delhi police was supporting Hindu rioters as mostly in all cases of riots the police always side with the Hindu rioters. Not because the establishment wants ,but entire police force has a genuine hatred for Muslim community due to their  criminal nature .

https://preview.redd.it/vok5f3ieegj41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4c97aacc2ff3a65b34d4c7e422402ce73037639

**Tl;dr**

Our commitment to our Keep Us Online campaign remains steadfast. On 22nd February 2020, IFF wrote to the Home Department of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) and key central government departments about the unlawful blocking of access to virtual private networks (VPNs) in J&K. We have demanded immediately revoking the same and restoring complete access to all internet content in the region.   


**Background**

The internet shutdown in J&K is soon approaching 210 days. In the midst of this, however, internet was partially restored on 18th January 2020 after the [**Supreme Court’s directions**](https://internetfreedom.in/scs-judgement-on-kashmir-communication-is-just-the-beginning/)in the *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* judgment. However, the restoration came with restrictions on the use of VPNs and permission to access only a narrow list of whitelisted websites (excluding social media websites). There have been [**reported instances**](https://www.medianama.com/2020/02/223-vpn-kashmir/) of people using VPNs getting beaten up by law enforcement authorities. Subsequently, [**an FIR was lodged**](https://www.medianama.com/2020/02/223-jammu-kashmir-social-media-vpn-police/) against people for using social media platforms via VPNs. The orders blocking VPN access were passed under the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, the FIR has been registered under laws like the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, the Indian Penal Code and, notably section 66A of the Information Technology Act. Section 66A was [**struck down**](https://www.medianama.com/2015/03/223-section-66a-unconstritutional/)as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2015.

As a response we have sent a letter to the Home Department of J&K regarding their move to block access to VPNs. *First*, we think the blocking is unlawful. *Second*, the punishment itself is disproportionate. *Third*, prohibiting the use of VPNs is harmful from a security, privacy and economic perspective. VPNs allow individuals to exchange information at a peer to peer level; protect proprietary secrets; and enable remote business to business collaboration. In particular, even if network traffic is sniffed VPN security models ensure confidentiality of the traffic. They are an essential component of internet browsing as they provide a safe user experience and blocking them actually facilitates censorship.

Therefore, we have demanded an immediate roll back of this measure and have written to not only the Home Department of J&K but also important Central Ministries, such as Law & Justice; Communications; Electronics & Information Technology; Home Affairs; Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY); and Department of Telecommunications (DoT).

**Our Representation**

Our representation was centred on the fact that applications like VPNs and social media websites are over-the-top (OTT) services and therefore fall outside the remit of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and similar frameworks which were used by the J&K Home Department to prohibit public access.   


To summarise, our representation challenged this measure on the following grounds:

* The parent statute providing legislative backing to the Telecom Suspension Rules and the Unified License Agreement (i.e. the Telegraph Act, 1885) clearly conveys that the framework is meant to regulate the activities of TSPs, ISPs and other backbone infrastructure providers. **It does not apply to internet users or OTT content application providers**.
* The IT Act provides for a clear code of offences and remedies for unlawful activity by internet users.
* Moreover, the IT Act has a specific provision under Section 69-A which allows the Central Government to block OTT applications and specific websites.
* Since the IT Act provides a modern specialised framework to regulate access to online content applications, the application of a more general law like the Telegraph Act is inappropriate.
* The current orders in Kashmir which provide a blanket ban on VPNs are arguably violative of the right to privacy and requirements for restrictions of lawfulness, necessity and proportionality.

The Government should stop any future action under the Telegraph Act, 1885 and frameworks thereunder to prohibit access to OTT applications i.e. specific websites and internet content. We also urged the Government of India to take immediate action and restore complete access to all internet content in the region.

**Next Steps**

1519,"UPDATE: My BFs [M28] mother doesn't want him to go out with a white girl.What has happened since my last post:

His mother kept being happy talking to me on the phone, my boyfriend went to America for a bit for a conference and I went back home for Christmas. I told my father everything and he said that he’s happy as long as I’m happy. I sent them a postcard from my hometown. 

While I was away, my boyfriend had a discussion with his mother about western women and he asked why she was so against the idea of him being with one. She ended up asking him if he had someone in mind as he was so insistent. He told her that he liked me a lot. He didn’t give her much more details than that. 

His mother told his brother that they need to find a girl who is like me but indian. His father called and said that he was going to find him a good girl from his hometown. As I came home his mother had changed and wasn’t so happy to see me again. 

You might recall we had agreed on telling them everything in January. I felt stressed and overwhelmed because of their reaction so we slowed down a bit and moved the date to March. It was really calm for a while until the day they went to visit his uncle. They had a sit down with the family, talked about me and said they think my boyfriend really likes me (this is all second hand information from his brother). His mother then asked his brother to break us apart if it was early stages and that the family would have to accept us if my boyfriend has chosen me. 

A lot hinges on his brothers visit this weekend. His family wants him to bring back information on the current situation. I guess we will have to sit down and decide what he will tell them. I’m quite nervous, not about the visit but about the potential chaos that follows. 

On the bright side, we went from “she has to be the same bloodline and caste” to “if he has chosen her we have to accept it”.

I should be really happy but I’m also worried they will resent me for not being what they wanted. I am worried that even if they allow this, I will never be able to have a good relationship with them. I’m so lucky that my boyfriend is able to reassure me all the time when I’m feeling overwhelmed cause this was a journey I never ever expected.

1574,"People, if your parents spend a lot of time playing mobile games (Candy Crush, Klondike etc), please make sure that they're not spending actual money.So today morning I found out that my dad spends money on mobile games. Not a huge deal I thought, it's his money, maybe he spends ₹300 or so once a month or on very rare occasions, still a waste but you know, it's his money I thought.

But then I dug deeper and I had the shock of my life. My father, the man who said I was spending too much money on Netflix, Swiggy and Amazon, has spent ₹14000 on microtransactions this month alone. To put that into context, a year of Netflix's HD plan plus ₹500 per month on Tatasky plus a year of Amazon Prime cost ₹14,200.

So he spent more in a month than we as a family spend on all these sources of entertainment every year. As I went further back on the transactions history page my heart sunk further into the depths. Since February 2019 he has spent ₹85,000 and since September 2017 (which is when he first started buying these microtransactions) he has spent ₹1,84,000. And all this on what? Games like Candy Crush and Klondike where the things he purchased get used up within the hour and have absolutely zero value.

Now it would be hypocritical for me to complain about how much my father spends on games when I myself have spent around ₹1,00,000 on buying my 40 PS4 games. But the thing is, I've been buying those since 2015, which is a much longer span of time, and if I were to sell those games on the used market or to my friends or even simply rent them out, I'd earn back at least 60-70% of the money I've spent on them. What I mean to say is that the games I have actual monetary value, unlike those gold bricks in Candy Crush. 

This is not at all taking into consideration the entertainment value they provide. These games have provided me with thousands upon thousands of hours of enjoyment without having to spend an extra paise on something I already owned. Compare that to Candy Crush where in a year you can spend ₹84,000 and get much less playtime and enjoyment that's not even 1% that of what you can get from proper games.

It would also be hypocritical for me to complain about microtransactions when I myself have indulged in them but even then there is a difference. The only time I have spent money on microtransactions is precisely ₹450 on Fortnite, a free to play game. The virtual currency that I spent money on has no value in the real world but the thing is, in Fortnite you don't have to spend any more money, you can just earn back virtual currency by playing it more. What I'm trying to say is that there is a stark difference between the microtransactions of a game like Fortnite and a game like Candy Crush. The microtransactions in the latter game are predatory and addictive while the ones in the former are not.

When I confronted my father about this he admitted to spending money on microtransactions, even though it was something I explicitly told him not to do, but he said that he had no idea that the amount of money he spent was so much. I don't know if he's telling the truth or not but he is an old man now so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. These games, though free, are designed to extract as much money as possible from you and make you addicted to them kinda like gambling and just like gambling, before you realise it you could end up spending as much money as my dad did.

I know some people might call me out by saying that I'm making this post to show that my dad is stupid or that I'm just showing off how rich my family is (we are not and we simply can't afford this rn, my parents are actually scratching their heads as I type this because they have insignificant savings and no plans about what to do after retirement). The point of this post is to warn you how dangerous these microtransactions are and how a man such as my father, someone who was very sharp with his money in his youth and taught me the importance of spending money wisely, can end up getting addicted and spending thousands. I don't want the same to happen to your parents or other family members so that's why I'm making this post.

So, in conclusion, please make sure that your parents or any other family member, isn't spending money on these games.",1582807768.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,25,74

*'and what will that do'*  

*'How will this help the victims'*


I simply ignore such questions. From my point of view, Even if i am successful in making just 4 people aware about this situation then that's a step in right direction.

6 years ago we would never accept such actions of Delhi police, Even in worst of the times This was not the face of india and thus we should not shrug this thing of as *Part and parcel.* This thing is not normal and we should not let them normalize it. 

**Delhi police is a state sponsored terrorist organization** we should use the term 'State sponsored terrorist organization' when we are referring to them because calling them 'Police' is morally wrong.

And i personally think Kejriwal and AAP's silence on this whole matter is simply not acceptable. We support aap not because they are alternative but because they not BJP or Congress(both are interchangeable when it comes comparing them to AAP). If they are being silent then whats the difference between them an congress?

*'Speaking/taking action against BJP will result into damaging their own party (AAP)'* 

And? so we should be silent? Or from another perspective let's say being silent is good for AAP.

So? should we the public accept that? even if that's true, the public should never accept their silence.They need to speak out and call out that Delhi Police is behaving like a terrorist organization. Otherwise they don't deserve our respect.

Once the term solidifies by the CM of Delhi then the international media can definitely pick up from that.

John Oliver's segment was good news, i wish he does atleast one more program on Saffron Terrorism, because of heavy demand ofcourse.And Bernie sanders statement is proof that we can do this, we can give this more media exposure internationally.

It was an ordinary childhood. 
But now in my 20s I'm overwhelmed by various afflictions. My parents have seperated. My career is struggling. Rather it hasn't taken off. Ive applied for jobs that pay puny sums. Despite the seemingly menial job role I was rejected. I was considered inept for an idiot-proof tasks. I feel immense shame.

My family heart of hearts holds me responsible for the breakage of my parents' union. They have no hesitation in making it subtly known that the burden of rapprochement is on me. My dear family members are afflicted by illnesses. Seeing them suffer devitalises me. My parents are joyless.

On the rare occasions when I dare to share my heartache with friends I'm snubbed. I'm called a milksop, coward. I'm not 'masculine' enough to face my cross, suffering like a man.

1609,"Saheli / NetflixHi Ladies,

I recently watched a series on Netflix called Sex Explained. In this series there is an episode called Birth Control which mentions a non-steroidal/ hormonal birth control named Saheli. This birth control has virtually no side effects and has been on the market in India for almost 30 years. Its active ingredient is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (Ormeloxifene). It’s a compound that acts on estrogen receptors in the uterus and prevents implantation from occurring. And it is only taken once a week. My mind was blown when I heard about this pill because all birth control I have ever tried here in the US has been a nightmare. I have tried various pills, the patch, IUD, Depo shot and I have experienced every side effect imaginable. After extensive research I decided to look into trying Saheli. I am currently on my second week of taking this birth control and so far so good. I have experienced a few mild hot flashes but it is normal to experience this while your body adjust to the pill. They come and subside very quickly and it hasn't been bothersome enough for me to want to discontinue use. I'll take hot flashes over weight gain and vomiting any day. I want to know if anyone else has ever heard of this birth control? Have any of you tried it? If so what was your experience? ",1582820434.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,15
1610,"I am from Shaheen Bagh and I hope the protest here ends.I remember the day of violence at Jamia university. I had just come from office and one of my friend who was in the rally that had tried marching towards parliament and as soon as it had reached Mathura Road, a major road in Delhi, the rally faced an unexpected amount of force from police, a violent lathi-charge. He said, people ran in all directions and cops chased them all over. Next thing he sees is buses burning, police firing gun on protestors. 

All I said to him is, "" I wish people didn't protest because this will not yield anything"", he didn't believe me so, I switched on my TV and showed him the narrative that was spun on the incident by media. He was shocked. Next day Shaheen Bagh protest started and rest is history. But never once did I think from day one that BJP will talk or courts will intervene. And never believed that this was a good idea as Shaheen Bagh road is major thoroughfare between Noida , Delhi, Faridabad and Gurgaon and hence it will only make more haters because I know most people don't really care what the Indian Muslim thinks. 

It has all come true, and today as more than ever, I wish this protest ended. 

I was brought up in India and never did I consider this country to be more than a Hindu nation, with Muslims living in their ""aukaat"". I grew up watching Mahabharata, Ramayana and om namah shivay on government owned national television, visited government offices with temples and other unlimited signs of Hinduism in government that established that. As you grew older, met kids who had never met a Muslim and knew zilch about Islam but could tell you 100s of stereotypes about Muslims as facts. Countless incidents made an imprint on you and you learnt to keep your head down and just live in your ghetto. But now my ghetto, which is chose for security over facilities is gone. 

But the thing is, I had learnt to live with that. But this protest makes me feel unsafe. I feel noticed. I don't want that. Till this protest , nobody knew what was Shaheen Bagh, I liked that. Now I feel exposed and worried that I might have crossed my ""aukaat"" and will soon feel the punishment for it. So please my friends at the protest, please stop it.



PS: just my rant, thought, don't downvote because you don't agree, kindly comment or else move on.

Edit : I also do not want the protest to end. You have to understand that as a Muslim in India, I am used to keeping my head down and going on with life. But this, this is totally new. This is a revolt of a sort, which totally makes lots of people among us nervous, we get these thoughts and I just articulated it here.

I have been studying for this exam day in and day out for 10+hrs a day for a little over a year, so much so that I have sacrificed whatever little social life I had, virtually closing myself inside a room. But it has now hit a serious roadblock. A construction recently started around my home and I had to switch from there to a nearby library around the RK Hegde Nagar area. I take my laptop and charger from which I study, make notes and do what not. It has been about a month going there. Normally, I stay there 5+days a week 7-9hrs a day.
The library is public, outside police quarters and is managed by them. Now, a couple of days back some random police guy not above the post of a sub-inspector comes in says that laptops are no longer allowed, he was miffed on I don't know what was very condescending towards me maybe because I am not a native, called me names - a salesman and what not. It was humiliating but I don't care too much about it. The librarian reiterated the no laptop policy, he(librarian) was his junior so he had to. 

Now I need help on what are my options on this? I have visited other libraries near my vicinity and none allow laptops with charger. The only alternative here is Just Books but the guy was reluctant to allow me there for more than 4-5 hours and I need to hog big. I really need your help, maybe a little recommendation from higher up, I dont know. Its been a couple of days and I am getting really anxious about not being able to study. What sould I do?

Hello everyone,

We are a group of researchers at the University of Toronto, Canada spearheading the OROS (Outcome Reporting in Obstetric Studies) Project. Our main goal is to improve health outcomes for mothers and babies in certain pregnancy conditions.

Our current focus of in pregnancies involve women with an elevated BMI/plus-sized (or soon to be) mommies. We need the input of **all relevant stakeholders** when it comes to plus-size pregnancies, and not leave the choice of outcomes entirely up to those who conduct the clinical trials. Thus we are **asking women who have been (or are) pregnant with an elevated BMI, clinicians and researchers who have worked with/had a role in caring for these subset of patients to please participate in our survey.**

It is a **quick and anonymous survey**, which will help clinicians and researchers around the world to not only further understand but better treat and manage these women and their babies. Here is the link, [https://delphimanager.liv.ac.uk/COSSOPP/Delphi](https://delphimanager.liv.ac.uk/COSSOPP/Delphi). Thank you so much for your precious time and input!!

P.S. The OROS website [https://www.obgyn.utoronto.ca/oros-project](https://www.obgyn.utoronto.ca/oros-project) gives additional information on our team and our work. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact our lead researcher, Dr. Rohan D’Souza at [dsouza.research.msh@sinaihealthsystem.ca](mailto:dsouza.research.msh@sinaihealthsystem.ca).

""Now there’s one thing you might have noticed I don’t complain about: politicians. Everybody complains about politicians. Everybody says they suck. Well where do people think these politicians come from? 

They don’t fall out of the sky. They don’t pass through a membrane from “another reality”. They come from American parents, and American families, American homes, American schools, American churches, American businesses, and American universities. And they’re elected by American citizens. 

This is the best we can do folks. This is what we have to offer. It’s what our system produces: Garbage in. Garbage out. 

If you have selfish ignorant citizens… If you have selfish ignorant citizens, you’re going to get selfish ignorant leaders. And term-limits ain’t going to do you any good. You’re just going to wind up with a brand new bunch of selfish, ignorant Americans. So maybe… maybe… MAYBE, it’s not the politicians who suck. Maybe something else sucks around here like: “the PUBLIC”. Yeah the public sucks. There’s a nice campaign slogan for somebody: “the public sucks, fuck hope”. Fuck hope. Because if it’s really just the fault of these politicians, then where are all the other bright people of conscience? Where are all the bright, honest, intelligent Americans ready to step in and save the nation and lead the way? We don’t have people like that in this country. Everybody’s at the mall!

1776,"Respect all religions or the lack of it but first look hard at your own life and our leadershipI was taken aback by the content of a post by  [u/pking3](https://www.reddit.com/user/pking3/) on this sub that is evidently getting a lot of attention and the direction in which it is taking the conversation. I thought of sharing my own thoughts about it.

[u/pking3](https://www.reddit.com/user/pking3/) is very eloquent in making many convincing arguments about the common origins of humans. I believe regardless of whether we consider ourselves and things around us an act of creation or not there is no doubt each and everyone of us has a common thread that binds us and I do not need religion or science to tell me that. I do not intend to contradict or debate his beliefs and respect his inner desire at seeing other fellow humans recognize what he perceives to be evidently true for everyone. He is also not alone in this as can be seen by the amount of people supporting his post.

However, I have a problem with [u/pking3](https://www.reddit.com/user/pking3/) outright rejecting all religions and making bold assumptions that all problems humans have today are because they invented and invested themselves in religion. If you consider faith in a creator or religion, as we all call it, to be in fact invented then you must also find it's existence itself in the scheme of things in evolution to be a much needed social mechanism for humans to coexist and survive in their respective ecosystems which overlap and mutate from time to time. Humans typically are self serving and nothing can change that. This is despite and not the result of presence of religion with its system of values, spirituality and self governance which do not always work effectively to curb us from desire to dominate others and more often than not is used as a tool. In that sense wealth is a tool, sex is a tool, race is a tool and even country is a tool people have used effectively for dividing and subjugating each other. If you must then eliminate all of these along with religion.

Contrary to perception of [u/pking3](https://www.reddit.com/user/pking3/) I believe its not the presence of religion but the dilution of its true meaning to us that has created friction between individuals and society. People love a culture of finding blame outside of themselves to explain away their problems which is ironically also what a call to banish religions is an attempt to do. Its nothing but exaggeration to say that massacres in history or our lifetimes are nothing but manifestations of practice of faith in general.  This is typical for propagating an alternate faith or the lack of it as the means to achieving lasting peace. Ideas similar to these have in turn given rise to other more divisive ideologies and we are lost in this circle of new ideologies upon ideologies to pacify our need to find the culprit of our misery. 

Hate and fear of all religions will transform into targeting specific groups owing to the actions of its followers who then retaliate. And on this latter point I would emphasize that a label of being a Hindu, Muslim, Christian or Atheist etc is enough for some to take sides and to support a leader, a cause or an organization over another but it is never enough to find a deeper understanding of themselves or following teachings which will in fact help improve things at the cost of our time and pride. People in general are too lazy about the mundane and excited about the sensational. Their leaders use this as a tool to misguide them and pit one group against another to achieve their personal agendas.

The point I'm trying to make is that a religious thinking in its true context forces man to look inward spiritually for what plagues him where he lives under certain circumstances. It powerfully teaches us to accept life and its injustices and despite that never to treat our reality as unquestionable and insurmountable. Getting even remotely close to perfection in religion requires hard work and patience which we are all lacking. Even the great leaders of faith have struggled with the very questions that trouble us about our existence and the meaning of it but they spent and dedicated their lives to seek answers to these inside their faith and constantly improved themselves and as a result those around them improved too. Dealing with some of their ill-conceived notions of how nature works and the science of what is observed can be challenging. The fact remains that religion just like science cannot answer all of our questions or resolve all of our problems but it can help us find meaning in our day to day struggles using certain ideas that may or may not be true. 

It's upto us how we carry these ideas to others. We have definitely failed in this by letting those among us who would rather point at others shortcomings when something goes wrong rather than find solutions. They know that people feel better about themselves when they are shown an exaggerated alternate reality of others who are different.

Shaping society in a meaningful way starts by respecting other peoples beliefs and making sure we are not overstepping their boundaries just as we do not want them to overstep on ours. This is true with all divisions whether it be wealth, race or country. Who will appreciate being looked down upon and be asked to change their ways? Religion provides a process of humbling ourselves and accepting that we are not perfect but we can be part of a multiple that is working towards a common goal. I to my knowledge do not know of humans living in complete harmony whether they follow some BS or perfect science. We are all united in this pursuit for peace only our ideas about peace are different.

Being united or equal does not mean we should take away all the differences between people. The paradox with this approach is imagining a world where aggressively removing divisive doctrine that we supposedly conceived at some point would make us or others less divisive. 

Unity is accepting these divisions as an inherent part of humanity, adopting the good we see in others and banishing the evil we see in ourselves.  We need to check ourselves before we create more divisions.",1582757529.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,12,30

1831,"Career advice needed. Is this idiotic?I'm planning to drop out and apply for a bachelors elsewhere (UK/Germany/Canada) but don't have a clue on how to.



I've compiled a list of the various universities.


I've noted the deadlines.






Unfortunately I don't have a high score in 12th.


81.3% from ICSE.
71.8% commerce from ISC.



But I'm confident I can score a high IELTS score.




Is it really possible to get admission elsewhere with my board percentage? (If I can secure a high IELTS score)



I'm currently preparing for my CA inter exams (I'm in my third year currently).



What I had planned originally for myself was to complete my CA and then pursue my ACCA (CA's  are exempted from 9/14 papers and the practical training as well)




My other plan was to complete my CA and then obtain the CPA designation from Canada or ACA from UK in order to move out.





If CA didn't work out then I would be switching over to ACCA.




So there's a long option for me which is to basically spend 6-8 years here and complete my education in order to leave.



And then there's a short option with which I can leave in the next year itself or even this year.








In short I want to move out of India but because of recent events, I'm considering the possibility to drop out and start my education elsewhere even if it made the last 3 years seem like a complete waste.



Being a Muslim, I'm shit scared for my life and future in this country. 


This govt isn't going to go away, the hatred is deep rooted and I feel the need to move my family to a safer place.


 I'm sick of this Hindu-Muslim crap. The politicians will always play this card because it provides them with amazing results.



Even if they are voted out, politicians from parties like BJP will always play the Hindu-Muslim card in the future as well.










I didn't take this option to study elsewhere earlier because our financial situation is extremely unstable. It still is.
I'm willing to resort to student loans for this.




Don't have any arrangements for funds and we struggle a lot to get by our expenses but I'm willing to take student loans just so I can get out.




I'm still young(20) so I'm extremely lucky to have time on my hands.





Am I thinking straight?

And something that bothers me is this. Why the fuck are we Indians so ugly? Why? I know I sound like a ranting teen but just hear me out.

Firstly it's not skin colour. I personally find dark skinned women more attractive. So ik it's not the skin color that's off putting to me. It's more about the facial structure and the overall appearance. I find that almost all other nationalities tend to better looking. And I am not talking about their movie stars or the rich folk. I am talking about your average person. Be it a cashier at a super market or that random girl who's the vet's assistant. Or the guy at the pharmacy. 

Indians have harsher features and in general, asymmetrical features. For example: Big noses. And something that I've noticed is this,mainly South Indians or darker skinned Indians tend to have these harsher features more. No, I am not trying to start a war here. I am a South Indian myself.

I preferred DD News over other channels because there reporting was so good. They reported facts, in simple words (not like private channels who created dramtic headlines for every unnecessary story) and were politically unbiased.
But the channel has changed so much and clearly taking political sides. The anchor repeatedly claimed that AAP leaders were giving inflammatory speeches and telling lies to people to start the violence. He pretty much said that the violence was planned months ago by AAP and Congress and they chose this day because Trump was here. Then he brought 4 more ""specialists"" to talk about the topic. And meanwhile saying that BJP is trying to control the situation.

**Cases and Events yet:**

- 3 people from China were rescued were found positive for coronavirus. They were traced and 1000s of people were kept under observations. Results: No other case was found and the 3 cases recovered successfully, and have been discharged.

- More than 600 people (mostly students) from China were rescued and kept in quarantine in Delhi, none of them tested positive for coronavirus, and are discharged.

- 130+ Indians stuck in Diamond princess. About 14 have been tested positive, rest are rescued from Japan, and will be kept in quarantine.



**Why hasn't India affected yet:**

(Possible reasons/Myths) -


**1. High temperature of India:**

**Myth**, as India has a varied range of climate and temperature, and at many places temperature is around 20°C, and virus can sustain such temperatures.



**2. Being poor country, not much tourists visit India:**

Myth, India ain't poor anymore. Like most countries, it has both developed and underdevelopment sides. It's the 5th largest economy in the world (even greater than Russia) and houses most number of billionaires after to USA and China. 
Every part of India showcases some touristic locations which are popular among foreign nationals.



**3. Indians have good immune system because of mostly Vegetarian diet.**

**Myth,** India has it's fair share of Meat-eaters too. There are more Meat-eaters in India, than Vegetarians. Although it's not known whether wild exotic animals are being consumed anywhere in India, but still santiary conditions that can shiver your conscience do exist in Indian slaughterhouses. 
Also, Immune system is helpful in recovering, once infected. And it won't help much in not getting infection, once the body comes in vicinity of the virus.



**4. Government is doing an excellent job in avoiding things that can cause a coronavirus outbreak:**

**Partly true**, as Screening of people is happening at all the airports, and timely decisions were taken regarding travel and diplomacy with China, which has greatly helped in escaping the coronavirus outbreak in India.
But still, government need to do much more to ensure public safety and to prepare for a sudden and accidental outbreak.
**INDIA IS NOT AT ALL PREPARED FOR AN OUTBREAK.**
Also, not sure how screening people at airport is helping out. While confirmed cases can be discovered easily, the virus takes more than 8 days to show symptoms. What if a person is infected, but hasn't started showing symptoms yet.


**Conclusion:**

It seems like India is just lucky that there is not an outbreak here yet, but observing the conditions in other countries, an outbreak seems inevitable in near future. Due to the high population density and low medical infrastructure, it is going to hit the South Asian regions the hardest.


**Advice:**

- Be cautious, and keep yourself and your family safe. Avoid unnecessary public meetings. 

- Use Alcohol based Hand sanitizer judiously. Maintain hygiene. 

- Avoid Handshakes, Hugs, other physical contacts for the time being. It takes a few days for the symptoms to occur, and so you never know who might be a carrier. Rememver the case of South Korea, and the story of the infamous Super-Spreader.

- Economy will be very unstable, Sensex has been going down for 4 days straight. Although I'm not an expert in Economics, but avoid investing now for the time being, and cash out some of the money from your bank account, to meet emergencies. 

- Stock food, water, masks, etc in your home.

**- Have a positive outlook to life, be happy, and keep everyone happy.**

***\[Last update 7:33 am\]***

New  Delhi is still burning, I thought that the situation is in control but  NO! Goons are taking advantage of the dark and the violence has again started in a few localities.

Dividing the post into 2 sections: Confirmed & Unconfirmed

If you are from New Delhi, Please connect with me via DMs. Even very little help will be a lot in these hard times. If this escalates, I'll  be creating separate sections for:

* How many possible groups active?
* In which direction they are moving after analyzing their previous locations?
* Possible next targets depending on a few factors.
* Where you can find possible help? \[Don't share helpline numbers with anyone  if you know about any such rescue teams operating in any areas\]

&#x200B;

Points to be considered:

1. If you know about any riots let me know
2. If you can confirm any incident in the unconfirmed section, Let me know.
3. If you are calling the police, ""RECORD THE CALL"", record every second.
4. Please  DO NOT spread any rescue numbers you see on a random thread to help people, The same strategy will be used tonight possibly, The goons are handling those numbers and they might possibly use it to hunt people.

NOTE: I won't be blindly trusting anyone

I was offered Mtech in a college through a 3rd party program. The 3rd party has collaborated with a college for a course and is giving out Mtech degree in the name of the college. Pretty good stuff. My problem is I had low marks in my Btech and the 3rd party overlooked this. Now after a week of classes, they inform me I might get kicked from the college as I do not meet the minimum requirement for attending Mtech in that college. What can I do about this? Is it legal for them to do this?  They do not know what might happen because the college has not said anything about it yet.

Thank you so much for reading!

### TL;DR

Reports emerged early this morning, that a vehicle registration database developed by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highway (MoRTH) called Vahan, which is accessible (to different degrees) by third parties and the public, maybe being misused by rioters for purposes of targeted violence. Although these reports have not been confirmed,   sharing and aggregation of public datasets by departments like MoRTH lead to potential risks of safety and fundamental freedoms. With the help of Srinivas Kodali who provided some timely insights and inputs we have co-developed a response to various departments of the Central Government and the Chief Minister of Delhi, Mr Kejriwa. In it we asked them to take immediate remedial measures.

### So what’s the situation?

In context of recent [**violent clashes**](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/violence-continues-in-delhi-for-third-day-several-dead/article30916226.ece) in Delhi, disturbing reports [**emerged this morning**](https://twitter.com/prasanna_s/status/1232517145088622592) which suggested that a database for vehicle registration called Vahan was exploited by malicious actors in identifying vehicles owned by Muslim vehicles, which were allegedly being burnt down. Although, this has not been confirmed by any formal news sources we feel this brings to light a serious human security risk emerging from the ethos of governing personal data.

### What’s the risk?

In the absence of personal data protection laws to protect people’s online privacy, the Government has been increasingly centralising and aggregating government databases, to extract economic value. An entire chapter in the [**2018-19 Economic Survey of India**](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/budget2019-20/economicsurvey/doc/vol1chapter/echap04_vol1.pdf)discussed this in great detail. However, these efforts have little regard for individual privacy and do not seek the informed consent of individuals before their personally identifiable information is integrated or used in these datasets. Further, aside from inter-departmental use and sharing of datasets, the Government is also increasingly making these databases available to third parties and even the wider public. The issue with such unfettered sharing of data, without appropriate consent mechanism or legal/institutional safeguards, the data can be misused in a myriad of ways. For instance, the Vahan database is accessible by Government and external parties under the MoRTH’s Bulk Data Sharing Policy. The purpose of this policy is to help the ministry monetise the data which it has in its coffers and allows private parties create solutions and services for its own commercial (or sometimes research) interests. However, in this instance, we have observed the risk of how such Government projects can be misused and can threaten the security and fundamental freedoms of minority and at-risk groups.

### Our Representation

Deeply concerned that government administered databases could inadvertently mobilise threats of violence and public property damage, we have written to different departments of the Union Government and the Chief Minister of Delhi articulating our concerns with the Vahan database and immediate actionable steps that we expect leadership to take. Our requests from the government were as follows:

1. Immediately stop public and private access to databases like Vahan and Sarathi.
2. Seek a legal opinion from Union Ministry of Law and Justice on the legality of MoRTH monetisation of these databases in light of the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s decision in the matter *KS Puttaswamy (Retd.) v Union of India*.
3. Immediately stop the aggregation of government databases which lead to seamless sharing of individuals’ personal and sensitive personal data without any meaningful consent.
4. Since several third party developers and private firms have already downloaded this data from the vahan website and related applications. We urge you to issue an urgent advisory for third party mobile applications to remove their applications from respective mobile stores.  It is reminded that these private firms and developers have illegally obtained this information and must be held accountable for their actions. The ministry is requested to take legal actions against these private firms and individuals.
5. Finally, moving forward we urge the Government to immediately issue a notification to ensure that public official usage of such datasets adhere to established principles of access control. Such measures are imperative to prevent misuse and/or abuse of personally identifiable datasets.

IFF will keep track on the situation and follow up if necessary. We would like to thank Srinivas Kodali for his inputs without which we would not have been able to send our representation.

&#x200B;

There is a dearth of platforms and people who are interested in delving deep into the multitude of issues that plague digital Indians today. What’s even more difficult is finding people who do it in an accessible manner. A large part of my job is to ensure that the work we do reaches people and finding partners who can help us make everyone informed about their digital rights and the threats to it.   


Collaboration has been a central function of growing awareness and providing a basis of civic engagement for more Indians. One of the first attempts we made was when the generous and excellent team from the independent digital media platform, [**Suno India**](https://www.sunoindia.in/)reached out to us with their, “[**Cyber Democracy**](https://www.sunoindia.in/cyber-democracy/)” podcast.   


***Suno India’s “Cyber Democracy” explores our digital fears and desires***  


In December last year, we decided to collaborate with Suno India on Cyber Democracy, a podcast that seeks to find out what democracy means in the digital age. This podcast is hosted by Srinivas Kodali, an independent, public interest technologist who has been relentlessly researching and documenting the development of public policy and regulations around tech in India.   


He uses the audio medium effectively by holding succinct and in-depth conversations with experts and activists alike, making it accessible for the larger public. From using drones to surveil protestors to [**mass deployment of facial recognition technologies**](https://internetfreedom.in/facial-recognition-in-india-part-i/)\- just when you think we have seen it all, something newer and crazier comes up. The worst part? The everyday Indian knows very little of these developments. This is precisely why collaborations like these become even more important to help us scale our impact. As a community-centric organisation, we need to focus on working with people and communities. Platforms like Suno India and shows like Cyber Democracy help us bridge the gap between our work and people’s understanding of their fundamental rights.   


***A podcast that talks about technology policy without being boring***   


One of the first episodes of Cyber Democracy throws light on the government’s reluctance to own up to data leaks and bugs as part of their systems. The episode is called Bugs in Cyberspace and you can listen to it [**here**](https://www.sunoindia.in/cyber-democracy/bugs-in-cyberspace/). It talks about one of the most persistent problems that plague us - the government’s vehement denial in the face of data leaks. A lot of the times, when these bugs have been brought to the attention of the authorities, the researchers simply don’t hear back from them. This is particularly scary in these times of rampant data breaches.   


Another one of such eye-opening episodes is about the increased use of drones and how their use is regulated and *if* these regulations are implemented. The episode was called Mechanical Birds. It discovers the history of regulations and how their use has changed over the years. It also speaks about the illegal use of drones during protests (more on this, [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/its-a-bird-its-a-plane-oh-no-its-a-surveillance-drone-we-write-to-the-dgca-to-take-action/)) and how these regulations apply to authorities and if they even need permits in the first place. Listen to the whole episode [**here**](https://www.sunoindia.in/cyber-democracy/mechanical-birds/).   


As someone who hasn’t studied law, I’m not familiar with a lot of the technical and legal terms that are often thrown around when we discuss these issues. It’s important that people understand what’s exactly at stake so they can fight back and help us fight back. One of the bugs that Karan from the Bugs In Cyberspace episode found in the Indian Gases web API impacted 600 million potential users whose records were stored in the database.  


***Tune*** ***in,*** ***today.***  


And now, after a series of insightful episodes and discovering things that make you wonder if you heard that right - This season of Cyber Democracy is going to end soon. Podcasts like these help us find newer ways to engage with people and communities. In other words, they have our back when we need it the most.  


The entire team at IFF is so thankful to have worked with Srinivas Kodali and Suno India on Cyber Democracy and we look can’t wait to see what’s in store for season two.

2079,"Lessons from the International Debate on Facial Recognitionhttps://preview.redd.it/n4h04zgjm7j41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ceeaf250c9cf5e48d381403eaf36c007f622aa8

### Tl;dr

In our previous posts in this series on Facial Recognition Technology (FRT), we have mapped FRT projects in different states in India and highlighted accuracy and privacy concerns that arise from the use of this technology. In this blogpost, we will trace the debate on FRT usage, and conclude by proposing the imposition of a moratorium on these projects.     


### Spike in Facial Recognition Technology Usage 

FRT has become increasingly ubiquitous in the daily lives of people from China’s [**surveillance state**](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/17/technology/china-surveillance.html) to the iPhones (or the Redmi phones) with a face unlock feature in our pockets. The previous posts have detailed how India is steadily warming up to the use of this technology for a plethora of functions. However, it is essential to clearly articulate how the data collected through this exercise will be used and safeguarded. This post will look at the solutions that some jurisdictions have tried to introduce and make the case for a moratorium being the best suited for India.  


### Tracing the Debate

Countries such as [**China**](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-professor-files-rare-lawsuit-over-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-11572884626) and [**Russia**](https://www.dw.com/en/russian-court-rejects-call-to-ban-facial-recognition-technology/a-51135814) have seen unsuccessful legal challenges to FRT wherein Courts have held that there has been no breach of privacy in both these instances. Hence, we must turn to countries which have taken a more proactive stance on dealing with this technology by envisaging diverse forms of regulation, such as:  

1. Complete bans,
2. Regulations applicable on public authorities or private players, and
3. Moratoriums.  


### Bans   

The US city of [**Somerville, MA**](http://somervillecityma.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=20991&highlightTerms=facial%20recognition%20technology) has placed a ban on any city officials/departments or people contracted by the city from employing this technology. The reasons it has given are as follows:      


1. Women, young people and people of colour have a higher risk of ‘false positive’ identifications;
2. Databases which FRT is applied to are plagued by racial biases which in turn generates copycat biases in face surveillance data; and
3. The public use of face surveillance can chill the exercise of constitutionally protected free speech.   


Other places such in the US have taken a similar stance and imposed complete bans on FRT by public officials (San Francisco, Cambridge, Oakland) or in body worn cameras by law enforcement officers (in Oregon). However, a well-executed ban would require thought and deliberation. For instance, in San Francisco, the initial ban [**had to be amended**](https://www.businessinsider.in/politics/news/san-francisco-is-changing-its-facial-recognition-ban-after-it-accidentally-made-the-iphones-it-gave-to-city-employees-illegal/articleshow/72894226.cms) to allow employees to use FaceID on their government-issued iPhones, a feature that didn’t seem to have been adequately considered beforehand.   


Clare Garvie of the Georgetown Law Center for Privacy and Technology [**has pressed the need to first define**](https://www.americaunderwatch.com/) what is meant by ‘facial recognition’. Does it simply mean matching of facial images or anonymised sentiment analysis, and any other current uses? A robust regulation would also need to take into account the global nature of the technology industry. Face-recognition algorithms used in one country may be made by a company from another country. Does such a ban simply mean a ban on the purchase of that technology, meant to be applied within the borders of one country, or does it also extend to import of FRT from another country. She concludes by saying that there is no political will and global capacity to entirely prevent the use or development of FRT around the world.      


### Regulations

Concurrently, countries which have embraced the use of FRT and are devising methods to regulate it. Last year when the [**South Wale Police’s use of FRT was challenged**](https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/bridges-swp-judgment-Final03-09-19-1.pdf) in the High Court of Justice, the Court did not find it violative of their data protection standards or other relevant laws. Moreover, it held that the use of this technology balanced the interests of the community (safety) and individual (privacy), and fell within the ambit of their existing laws. On the basis of this case, the [**Information Commissioner of the UK has recommended**](https://ico.org.uk/media/about-the-ico/documents/2616184/live-frt-law-enforcement-opinion-20191031.pdf)cogently laying down how these laws govern the use of this technology.   


The US state of Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) lays down strict standards which are applicable to private entities. It requires written consent before collecting someone’s biometric information (one of which is face geometry). Biometric data is particularly sensitive information because it is unique to every individual. Passwords and social security numbers, for example, can be changed in the event of breach, but a face cannot. Under BIPA, individuals can sue anyone violating their privacy rights even[ **absent a financial injury**](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/illinois-supreme-court-declares-aggrieved-under-bipa-includes-those-no-injury) resulting from the violation. [**Facebook**](https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-reaches-550-million-settlement-in-facial-recognition-lawsuit-2020-1?IR=T) has been held liable under BIPA for illegally collecting and storing facial recognition data for its ‘Tag Suggestions’ feature.    


However, exceptions exist. A private entity has to disclose the collected biometric data if it is a requirement under state/federal/municipal law, a warrant or a subpoena. The State of Washington, US - home of Big Tech companies Amazon and Microsoft - has also proposed a bill which will regulate private entities using FRT and has similar exceptions, i.e., making disclosures to government authorities if it is permitted under existing laws. For those looking to implement laws similar to these, the principal question that arises is whether there are enough existing safeguards in place to successfully protect people’s data. A question, [**as we have previously noted**](https://saveourprivacy.in/), India cannot answer in the affirmative since the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDP Bill) has still not been implemented.                 


### Moratoriums 

Civil liberty organisations advocate [**putting a halt on the use of FRT**](https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615098/facial-recognition-clearview-ai-epic-privacy-moratorium-surveillance/) until further debate. Realistically speaking, it is prudent to recognise the widespread adoption of FRT and begin contemplating how we will address its worst tendencies. In its recently published [**white paper**](https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/commission-white-paper-artificial-intelligence-feb2020_en.pdf) on the use of Artificial Intelligence, the European Union concluded with pressing upon the need to have a sustained conversation about how to adequately regulate the use of this technology. It invites comments from various stakeholders so that standards may be set down. 

Similarly, the US Congress has been under pressure from activists and concerned citizens to take action on FRT regulation. Consequently, two Senators in the US have recently put forth a legislation which proposes a moratorium while a Commission - comprising law enforcement and immigration enforcement officials, privacy and technology experts and communities most impacted negatively by the use of FRT - submits a report with its recommendations to the Congress. The Congress must then pass a law to regulate FRT within a specified timeframe.    


### So what should India do?

Based on the observations in [**our previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/), FRT systems in India need a lot of fine tuning before they can be rolled out properly. Further, based on India’s experience with Aadhaar, it would be advisable to hit pause and contemplate the serious challenges that come with an invasive technology. Retrospectively regulating an already introduced measure would be an extremely difficult task and would mean setting ourselves up for failure. Taking the lead in flagging this issue, we propose a moratorium of three years on the ongoing FRT projects in India which would mean pressing pause on these projects. We also hope to have more clarity in this regard once the Personal Data Protection Bill is passed.           


In the meanwhile, a thoughtful dialogue is required where government, industry, civil society, human rights groups, academia and similar stakeholders have a proactive dialogue which can articulate a policy-making/legislative pathway on the issue. The conversation must be nuanced enough to differentiate between different uses of the technology which can span governance, monitoring, law enforcement, commercial, R&D, academia, healthcare, and many more unforeseeable domains. However, as we have previously observed in this series, the Indian Government and some members of industry are essentially running the risk of placing the proverbial cart before the horse. The need for a conversation is urgent and we will use these global learnings to inform our own position moving forward.

2179,"Religious, Atheists and Agnostic people of r/India, lets have a discussion about Religion and God!To all the religious people : What makes you believe there is a God? Why do you have faith in your particular religion you follow?

To all the atheists : What makes you believe that there isn't one?

To the agnostics : What makes you believe we can't find out God's existence?

This is just for discussion. I hope we don't downvote religious people when they put out their points and we won't downvote atheists when they put out their questions. Let's not discourage people.

Let's just read each other's arguments and contribute in a constructive way if we can.

Let's do it!

But we must not hate. We must not become like them. Egalitarian beliefs easily transform into ones not at all egalitarian against those we believe are racist and fascist. Just look at the [incidents](https://youtu.be/2cMYfxOFBBM) that transpired at Evergreen College in WA, USA. Views that started out nice and turned out extreme, much like the roots of the other side.

This is a reminder to listen to what those against us have to say with open ears and an open mind, and agree with what is right. Be rational and don’t get carried away with negative emotions. To argue, don’t dismiss like they do but calmly present your points and your evidence, which in most cases, is far better and more numerous then what they have to say. 

Because we are better than them in our minds and we must be in our actions too. Hate is only incited in those already predisposed to hate the target - it never works as a convincing mechanism, neither do Ad Hominem fallacies or any other Bias. Be empathetic and see why they may think what they do, and try your best to convince. Respect their beliefs and they’ll respect yours, much improving the chance that they might be receptive to change.

Don’t be like them. Be better. Preach Love Not War and Hate of Words and Hands, even to those who do the former.",1582709617.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,5,7

### 1) SARS-­CoV-­2 

* A paper published in a recent issue of the peer­reviewed, open­access journal ‘Emerging Microbes and Infections’ has cautioned that SARS­-CoV-­2, the virus causing the COVID-­19 outbreak, is being shed through multiple routes, so testing through oral swabs alone might not be sufficient
* A paper by Wei Zhang, et al, all from the CAS Key Laboratory of Special Pathogens at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, says investigations on patients in a local hospital infected with the virus revealed the presence of SARS-CoV-­2 in anal swabs and blood as well. What’s more, more anal swabs than oral swabs tested positive at a later stage of infection. Since COVID­19 is believed to be a disease of the respiratory tract, usually only oral swabs are used for diagnosis, and discharge is based on the oral swabs testing negative. The anal positives suggested, they argued, shedding through the oral ­fecal route, and therefore transmission is possible as well. The researchers also showed that a serology test (testing blood for antibodies) can improve detection positive rate, and thus should be used in the future.
* As part of the research, samples ­ including oral swabs, anal swabs and blood were collected by Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital. Two investigations were performed the paper describes ­ In the first investigation, samples were taken from 39 patients, 7 of whom were in a ‘severe condition’. In the second investigation, samples were lifted from 139 patients, whose clinical records were not available.
* When counting all swab positives together, we found most of the positives came from oral swab (8/10, 80%) on day 0. However, this trend appears to change on day 5. We found more (6/8, 75%) anal swab positive than oral swab positive (4/8, 50%)
* The data suggested a shift from more oral positives during the early period to more anal positives during the later period
* The current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019­nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative
* This observation implies that a patient cannot be discharged purely based on oral swabs testing negative, and the researchers go on to make a recommendation to do serological tests to confirm the status

#### About Coronaviruses

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that may cause illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

#### What is COVID-19?

COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

#### About SARS

The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that causes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) are related to each other genetically, but they are different. SARS is more deadly but much less infectious than COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere in the world since 2003.

### 2) G20 Meeting in Saudi Arabia

* Recently, the ministers and central bankers from the world’s largest economies participated in the G20 meeting held in Riyadh (Saudi Arabia).
* It was presided by Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the first Arab nation to hold the G20 presidency.
* The 2020 G20 Presidency will focus discussions, forums, working groups and Ministerial Meetings under the theme of “Realizing Opportunities of the 21st Century for All”.

#### Key Points

* Global Economy:
   * The global economic growth remains slow and downside risks due to the geopolitical and remaining trade tensions, and policy uncertainty.
   * Though the economic growth is expected to increase in 2020 and 2021 due to loose monetary policy and an easing of trade tensions.
* IMF’ Views at the Meeting:
   * It projects a “V-shaped, rapid recovery” for the global economy, but it warns about the uncertainty around the spread of the coronavirus (COVID 19).
   * The IMF also warned about other risks including rising debt levels in some countries as well as climate change.
* Demand for Global Taxation System:
   * It discussed ways to achieve consensus on a global taxation system for the digital era by the end of 2020.
   * It aims to allow governments to tax digital companies where they do business, rather than where they are registered for tax purposes.
   * India has also demanded closer collaboration between international revenue agencies to investigate the tax affairs of offenders who cross borders for escaping tax investigation.

#### G-20

* About
   * The G20 is an informal group of 19 countries and the European Union, with representatives of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
   * The G20 membership comprises a mix of the world’s largest advanced and emerging economies, representing about two-thirds of the world’s population, 85% of global gross domestic product, 80% of global investment and over 75% of global trade.
* Headquarter
   * The G20 operates as a forum and not as an organization. Therefore, it does not have any permanent secretariat or management and administrative structure.
* Origin
   * 1997-1999 Asian Financial Crisis: This was a ministerial-level forum that emerged after G7 invited both developed and developing economies. The finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in 1999.
   * Amid the 2008 Financial Crisis, the world saw the need for a new consensus-building at the highest political level. It was decided that the G20 leaders would begin meeting once annually.
* Members
   * The members of the G20 are Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Union.
   * One nation holds the Chair every year, known as the 'G20 Presidency'. Argentina chaired the G20 summit of 2018 and Japan for 2019.
* V-Shaped Recovery
   * A V-shaped recovery is characterized by a sharp economic decline followed by a quick and sustained recovery.
   * The recession of 1953 is an example of a V-shaped recovery.
   * A V-shaped recovery is different from an L-shaped recovery, in which the economy stays in a slump for a prolonged period.

* Increased Accessibility: The Supreme Court was hailed for the “extraordinary effort” to make its judgments more accessible to the common man by making them available in nine vernacular languages, keeping in mind the nation’s linguistic diversity.
* Gender Justice: The recent directives for granting equal status to women in the Army, guidelines for preventing sexual harassment at the workplace, etc. were appreciated.
* Global Reference: The Chief Justice of India said that the Supreme Court’s judgments are cited by courts of other countries and have served as a “beacon of hope” to independent and developing nations.
   * A 2001 verdict of the South African court cited the Indian case of Narain Das Jain v Agra Nagar Mahapalika decided by the Supreme Court in 1991 to benchmark the compensation to be provided while acquiring land.
* Use of ICT: The need for technology was highlighted to deliver speedy justice.
* The Government is making an effort to connect every court of the country to the E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project. The establishment of the National Judicial Data Grid will make court procedures easier.
* Future Challenges: It was highlighted that issues like data protection and cybercrimes pose new challenges for the judiciary.

#### E-court Integrated Mission Mode Project

* The E-Courts Project was conceptualized based on the ""National Policy and Action Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the Indian Judiciary - 2005"" submitted by the e-Committee of the Supreme Court of India (set up in 2004).
* The main objectives of the e-Court Project are as follows:
   * To provide efficient & time-bound citizen-centric service delivery.
   * To develop, install & implement decision support systems in courts.
   * To automate the processes to provide transparency of Information access to its stakeholders.
   * To enhance judicial productivity both qualitatively & quantitatively, to make the justice delivery system affordable, accessible, cost-effective & transparent.
* The e-Courts National portal (ecourts.gov.in) was launched in 2013. This provides Case Status, daily Case-list, Cases Filed and Cases Registered through the Case information System (CIS) Software.
* The National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG) is a part of the e-Courts Integrated Mission Mode Project. It was launched in 2015. The aim is to track judicial performance across different courts in the country.
   * The NJDG is working as a National data warehouse for case data including the orders/judgments for Courts across the country.
   * NJDG works as a monitoring tool to identify, manage & reduce pendency of cases.
   * It also helps to provide timely inputs for making policy decisions to reduce delay and arrears in the system, facilitate better monitoring of court performance and systemic bottlenecks, and, thus, facilitate better resource management.
   * NJDG has specifically helped India improve its ranking in the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Report.

### 6) Joint Commands

Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) office is working on a tentative timeline for the establishment of joint commands among the three defense services Army, Navy and Air Force beginning with an Air Defence Command.

#### Joint Commands

* It is a unified command in which the resources of all the services are unified under a single commander looking at a geographical theatre.
* Meaning, a single military commander, as per the requirements, will have the resources of the Army, the Navy and the Air Force to manage a security threat.
* Functions of joint command:
   * The commander of a joint command will have the freedom to train and equip his command.
   * He will have the logistics of all the services at his beckoning.
   * However, the three services will retain their independent identities as well.
* Joint command at present:
   * There are two tri-services commands at the moment.
   * The joint command at the moment, the Andaman and Nicobar Command (ANC), is a theatre command, which is headed by the chiefs of the three services in rotation. It was created in 2001 after a Group of Ministers had given a report on national security following the Kargil War.
   * The Strategic Forces Command was established in 2006 and is a functional tri-services command.
* What is the structure right now?
   * There are 17 commands, divided among the three services.
   * The Army and the Air Force have seven commands each, while the Navy has three commands.
   * These commands report to their respective services and are headed by three-star officers.
   * Though these commands are in the same regions, they are no located together.
* Need for joint commands?
   * The leader of unified command has control over more varied resources, compared to the heads of the commands under the services now. And the officer commanding will have access to the Air Force’s fighter jets and can use them if needed. Through such integration and jointness, the three forces will be able to avoid duplication of resources. The resources available under each service will be available to other services too. The services will get to know one another better, strengthening cohesion in the defense establishment.
* Do the militaries of other countries have such commands?
   * Several major militaries are divided into integrated theatre commands. China’s People’s Liberation Army has five theatre commands: Eastern, Western, Northern, Southern and Central. Its Western Theatre Command is responsible for India. The US Armed Forces have 11 unified commands, of which seven are geographic and four functional commands. Its geographic commands are Africa, Central, European, Indo-Pacific, Northern, Southern, and Space. Cyber, Special Operations, Transportation and Strategic are its functional commands.

### 7) World’s largest cavefish discovered in Meghalaya

A team of experts from the UK, Switzerland, and India have discovered the world’s largest species of cavefish in Meghalaya’s Jaintia Hills.

#### About

* The cavefish, similar in anatomy to an endangered mahseer species, is around one and a half feet in length and was found inside a remote cave in Jaintia Hills.
* The fish has no eyes and is white due to a lack of melanin pigmentation.
* As they live in a nutrient-limited environment most of these species are small.

### 8) Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* The State Government of Arunachal Pradesh intends to build a highway through the 862 sq km Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) in East Kameng district.
* The Government had in the past built a highway through the Namdapha National Park.

#### Key Points

* The project is named the East-West Industrial Corridor which is a proposed elevated corridor at the tiger reserve, to be constructed at an estimated cost of Rs.2,550 crore.
* The highway aims to connect Bhairabhunda in West Kameng district and Myanmar in Changlang district along Arunachal Pradesh’s border with Assam.
* The argument over an elevated corridor at the PTR was that it can ensure the free movement of wild animals.
* The state government felt the project would enhance connectivity and develop the state’s foothill areas into economic and industrial zones.

#### Issue Area

* Trees may have to be felled and pillars erected from the ground. Petrol, diesel and other materials will be transported, leading to loss of natural habitat.
* This corridor will be a threat to the adjoining Nameri Tiger Reserve in Assam too.

#### What should the Govt. do?

* The Government, while building such a mega project, should consult renowned conservation organizations in the area and also bring all stakeholders who will be impacted by the project on to the negotiating table.

#### Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR)

* It lies in the foothills of the Eastern Himalaya in the East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh.
* It falls within the Eastern Himalaya Biodiversity Hotspot.
* Pakke is also the only Hornbill sanctuary in India.
* The vegetation is predominantly tropical semi-evergreen forest.
* What makes PTR special are the brilliant efforts of the Forest Department and local communities like that of the Nyishi Tribe who inhabit the area around the park to protect the wildlife here.

2272,"Can someone help me with my Website, sipe? [Monetization, Hosting, Domain, Ideas for Educational Website]I run a website for BMM Notes. It has been almost three years as I have put in countless hours and money into the website but I do not exactly know how to get returns from it. And while I was searching for that I also found out my Domain and Hosting is expiring in less than a week.

&#x200B;

\*\*About my Website\*\*

As I mentioned earlier it is for Mass Media. However that was the story till I graduated \[a year ago\]. It started out as a model to help students of my class because teachers don't exactly teach. We had this teacher who came in class and started chatting and discussing random stuff and then all her lectures started getting cancelled and soon exams came and nobody had any idea what to do, this is the case on some days while on other, teachers send huge PDFs of 300 Pages a night before the exam and say ""Study from this.""

&#x200B;

I was really fed up with this problem. So I started gathering question banks and papers and syllabus and sent it across. Initially it was only limited to my class, but soon my classmates shared it to other colleges and there was a point when each and every student of this course recommended my website, even the teachers! \[there were many who hated it coz they think its money making by some teacher, as they did not know my identity, and some just preferred books\]

&#x200B;

\*\*1. Monetization\*\*

I have added Ad Sense in December, however it does not pay ... much. I am uploading screenshot of my traffic on two different dates. Sometimes I get this with promotion and sometimes without.

This is the Traffic on days when there are no exams. However it is like 20 times higher than this when its exam season. I have also been able to cross 7 Million Views on my site in 2 Years

I was told by a few to apply for a Subscription based Model but I really don't want to go for that as if I were to put myself in the shoes of the users, I will have two options, a book for 200 bucks or a website which charges a feasible amount. I will mostly go through the book because we/I don't always prefer online payments. And my audience is around 18-21 Years of Age.

&#x200B;

If possible does anyone know of any method by which I can monetize my website better?

&#x200B;

\*\*2. Hosting and Domain\*\*

I was using GoDaddy but heyyyy their prices are high upon renewal. I came across Google Domains which I thought was decent but does anyone else have any better options?

&#x200B;

\*\*3. Ideas.. please?\*\*

I started it as BMM but I got many people telling me to add other courses but I don't exactly know how to. Plus the amount of time needed to be invested in it, and the money, it does not pay out as much. I am dedicated with the website as I was on the first day, but I need some tips on how to further get ahead with it.

They all want to just believe in something good after death. Sorry to burst your bubble but the only thing that happens is that you blackout and stop existing. Your body will decompose, breakdown into its elements and one day get blown out into the universe during a supernova. 


You are insignificant in the grand scheme of this universe. You do not matter. But what matter itself, is being part of this universe. 


But, you are here in the now. You are existing in this world where time passes and the universe is larger than anything you can fathom. So why do you keep insisting on believing in man made stories. There is No God, there is no rebirth, there is no heaven or hell. But there is this universe, where we all exist. Religion has brought us nothing but hardship and mass murder on a scale that would make the Spanish flu look like a minor common cold. Just take a step back and look at the past and see the countless lives that were lost because religion asked to do so. None of your religions are without blood in your hands. All of your religions have committed brutal acts of mass murder. And none of your religions have been able to answere any of the basic questions to life death or reincarnation. **False prophet and make believe deities, is what religion is.**


Let go of these childish beliefs people, face the truth, that you are the one that controls your destiny. Believe in the humanity of people, have faith on people. We are all part of this speck of dust, flying through the universe.  What determines our immortality is not what you did for your religion, but what you did for the future of this little speck of dust flying through the universe. Your legacy should and always be the betterment of mankind.


 A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. 


Leave your religion, open your mind, and be loyal to your species. We are all the same and nothing divides us except religion. As we can all see when humans place emphasis on learning and science we all become better, but the moment religion enters all of humanities hard work is destroyed. Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.

Is it possible to get the twitter accounts of IT cell managers like Malviya blocked by mass reporting their tweets? If 10% of the 2000+ active members on tuis sub mass report the accounts, will twitter take them down?

I saw an interview of Rajdeep Sardesai with Malviya yesterday- this uncouth bastard was shouting at Rajdeep and threatening him openly. I think he is much more dangerous than the other bastards in the party. The arrogance he exudes would fail even Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi. 

But pride hath a fall. This son of a cockroach will meet his fate some day. The poison his mouth spouts would have contaminated an entire generation by then.

2474,"Relationships: How do I grapple with this adulthood concept?throwaway since its a bit personal.

This comes after failing at finding even a possibility of love time and again. Just as any healthy individual I have had crushes growing up and have gotten over it as I have matured. However as I hit early 20s (22 and above) I developed an understanding of what real chemistry with a person meant. After that it was not the silly crushing on the next handsome guy, or emotionally unavailable guys, or the guys looking for casual sex ( in todays parlance ""fuckboys""). I slowed down.

The first time I felt connected on an intellectual and emotional level with a man, I was 23F. We worked at the same place, we would never tire of conversing with each other, we instinctively knew if the other person was in a bad mood, we had deep conversations, we got to know about the other's families( never met them though). After gradually loosing confidence over my ability to choose the right partner, I started feeling certain again. But it took me 1 year to admit to him that I liked him romantically. He never said no. He didn't say yes either. He was getting married in 3 months.

During the course of my higher education, I crushed on 2 shitty guys. Got over the first one rather quickly and the second was a tough one. The second guy just played me(lead me on). Took me 2 months to get over that one.

Fast forward 4 months and I met a very sweet guy, someone kinda my type. I felt really attracted to him. He was on a short term project. We saw each other in class everyday. Small talk. Then on his last week we had an hour long conversation- a nice one. We exchanged phone numbers. He went back to his home city. We texted back and forth every other day for just over a week. Slowly it seemed one-sided. Guessing he got busy since texts died down and I was tired of being the one to always initiate texts.

Now, I feel more dejected that I couldn't land one serious genuine relationship in my 20s, and I see the next person coupling up rather quickly.

It was easy to get over crushes when I could pin-point what quality I didn't like in the guy- mostly character/behavior flaws I couldn't overlook.

My other concern is this. As I age, I find better nicer people to love- and it gets difficult to move on knowing I couldn't interest a nice person.

So how do you move one from unrequited love on a nice person? And how do you retain faith on the possibility of finding the right person in the future- seems like the pool of available men gets smaller and smaller as I hit 27 yrs. And I haven't had even one relationship.",1582656940.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,3,11

2477,"We need to act smartWe all know what's happening in India now.

My take is that we will not be able to change anything or overthrow the government just by protests. No matter how many people dies, the national media is just going to turn things upside down and brainwash these people. Moreover I believe more than half of the population is brainwashed into toxic fascists. So protests are just impossible to bring about a change, atleast in the current situation

Another problem is the spreading of misinformation through social media. Now it has reached a point where the IT Cell is no longer needed to spread certain things because the bhakts would do it themself. Through all these years BJP has done a very good job at slowly changing the mindset of people and we never thought it would lead to these consequences. So fighting on social media is also pointless. We are just too late.

This country will be done if BJP wins the next elextion too as this would give them even more confidence to do shit

Guys, Is there anything else we can do? There are already many news sources and journalists who are working hard doing fact checks and bringing out the truth. But is that all we can do now? Can we somehow boost their performance to reach more audience?

What about pressure from international organisations and other governments? Would that bring in any effects? Can we somehow pressurise social media platforms to curb fake posts?

Is there anyone or any group doing any clever work out there with a long term goal in mind? Or else it is high time we make one to take these bigots out strategically without indulging in direct encounter.

We need to make a plan strategically and do a slow well coordinated attack. Let's pool some ideas for this",1582658322.0,,,dark,11,20

The media is so focused on CAA I can't find any recent updates and with the rest of the world suddenly spiking in infection rates over the last 48 hours I'm won't be surprised if the trend is the same here but no one seems to be reporting on it. 

Here's the thing, with so many people protesting and counter-protesting everywhere this virus will hit the jackpot in India. The global spike in infections is barely a couple of days old and ongoing so I'm a little concerned that it's prevalence in India isn't even a footnote in most news cycles

2529,"Planning for my Masters in Germany. Need advice from experienced peopleHi everyone, so as of now I’m a student pursuing his degree in BCA at a good uni and I have plans to go to Germany for my masters in Computer science next year 

There are few things I’d like to know and I’ll state them below 

1. This is my biggest concern, so I completed my 12th in the year 2015 after which I joined engineering due to parental pressure and I was in engineering until 2018 at which point I had a mental breakdown and I had to quit. After which I joined BCA.
So my question here is will this be a problem in any way when I apply for masters ? Will the German universities question me as to what I was doing for 3 years and why do I have a gap in my education 

2. If anyone here has been to Germany for their masters, how was your experience ? Would you advice me to be prepared for anything ? 

3. So I’ve researched a bit and I found that speaking German is very important ( I’m planning to take up German classes ) and I also noticed they don’t give much importance to TOEFL or IELTS. Should I focus on getting a IELTS certificate or should I just focus on perfecting my German or should I do both ? 

4. How is the social life there apart from college ? I’m a very shy and introverted person and I’m hoping this experience brings me out of my comfort zone 

5. This is for experienced people with jobs, would you recommend getting a masters degree ? Because I have lots of family members who are advising me against pursuing masters because it’s of no use.

2540,"My thoughts on the current scenario - Morning rant!The current situation is more disappointing than its scary. These are easily avoidable scenarios, but the unfortunate reality is that those running this nation have been fuelling hatred across the country as their USP... And so many have have fallen for it hook, line, and sinker!

The disappointment is there because we as humans thrive in chaos. Almost like we don't want a peaceful life.

We want to feel better about ourselves, that we are better than others. But we don't want to put in the work to BE BETTER, oh no no no no. We are insecure but lazy, why improve when we are actually better due to our nationality, and within our nation we are better due to our religion, and within our religion we are better due to our caste.. so on and so forth! See we were born Rockstars. 

Hardships are part and parcel of growing up. Though many a times it's easier to blame others for our problems instead of putting in the work and actually making things better. 

Your life is in shambles not because of what someone else is eating, or who they are praying to. The sooner you realise the better it is for yourself because may be then you can focus on actual issues (behavioral, educational, etc), and make your life better. Until then those who want power will keep manipulating you to further their agenda.

All those who think non Hindus are the problem.. fret not, since time immemorial Dictators rose to and maintained their powers by sowing the seeds of hatred among the populace.

Once we successfully eliminate the secular fabric of our nation, who do you think the next scapegoat would be? It very well may be YOU! May be because of your caste, maybe because of your region, you never know. 

We will only succeed and grow as a society, if we are putting in the work to be better as humans. That will only happen if instead of religion, our main focus is on education of the masses. 

The basis of a successful society has to be fuelled by empirical evidence and logic and not nationality/religion/caste/colour!

The most memorable scene for me was a night after the Godhra massacre. I am a hindu brahmin by birth although I never believed in god or religion. 

That fated night everyone in our housing society came out at 11 pm with kitchen knives, sutli bombs and hockey sticks. Jai Sree Ram was being chanted on car speakers with the doors and boot opened (no portable speakers back then). The cause? A rumor spread by someone about an incoming mob of muslims. 

The entire locality, which now houses the Marriott hotel at less than 100m away, came out with knives, was out with dangerous crackers, sticks and a lot of enthusiasm to kill. Uncles I considered to be gentle folks were wearing tikkis and holding trishuls. 

That muslim mob never came, possibly it was fake news. 

But I realized how people can transform at the drop of a hat when confronted with religion. 

My friends in primary school said that muslims are bad, in the presence of muslim teachers. I never knew what a muslim was, but they did. 

Soon, the shops of muslims were looted on CG road. That was the most shopping destination of Ahmedabad. 

My teachers saw how a stabbed guy was running to his death in the old city (my school was in St Xaviers mirzapur). People used Ether on knives to mask the injury. They stabbed you in the crowd, and you won't feel the pain till it was too late.

What is happening now is eerily similar.
Bastard chutias with 0 contribution to elections or society are making Delhi into Gujarat. Same principles. Target muslims. Expect retaliation. Employ hindu khatre mein hain rhetoric. 

Please do not react Muslims. Delhi is not Gujarat. Even the kattar gandu bhakts will piss in their pants before shooting at you with cameras everywhere. Use cameras. Use alarms to know if any bhakt is doing mischief in your vicinity. They do all this to cause riots. 

DO NOT BECOME THEIR FODDER. 
TRUST ME, BETTER DAYS COME. SUCH BHAJPA CHUTIAS WILL BE PUNISHED.

1. Collecting Evidence:   
The evidence you collect should be verifiable to actually matter. For that it is necessary that you keep the original photos and have location, date, time tags enable. Apps such as ProofMode (from the Guardian Project) can be used.   
Caution: The Exif/Meta Data will allow unique identification of your phones. 
2. Storing Evidence:  
Keeping photos/videos on your phone might get you into trouble if it is searched and might also be forcefully wiped. On a preliminary level services like Secure Folder, Island etc. will help you hide stuff on a face level.   
But, the best recourse would be to encrypt the evidence using PGP and uploading it to a Cloud Service. 
3. Sharing Evidence:  
Use encrypted services such as ProtonMail to transfer.   
For completely anonymous sharing use the Onion Share. It's an extremely easy to use service which uses the Tor Browser/Network. One can Share Files or set up a link to Receive Files (like a Secure Drop).",1582650257.0,,CAA-NRC,dark,0,14

Just a reminder of what
Justice Anand Narayan Mulla of Supreme Court once said in his [judgement](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1498181/) :

>""There is not a single lawless group in the whole of the country whose record of crime comes anywhere near the record of that single organised unit which is known as the Indian police force""

&#x200B;

# Delhi Police is directly Under MHA [Amit Shah].

&#x200B;

Comment the links below and I'll add them here.

P.s.: This is in no way an insult to Delhi Police as an organisation or people who are giving their life to control mobs.

Growing up in india, i went to public school built by a freedom fighter, so was the college. Looking back, i remember all the teachers always had an underlying comment about me, that i ll do something good for the country, as i usually stood as one of the toppers. I also dont come from a higher caste, so i am heavily aware that if Gandhi and that whole generation hadnt worked hard, and literally gave their life, i would not have had a decent life. No fuckin way. 

Now i am in US, with high paying job.

India is burning, and all i can do is try to convince my bhakt friends, participate in the protests here etc. Nothing of significance. Im not gonna lie, i would probably wont be going back. Its selfish thing. I dont feel good about it. Ppl gave their lives which gave a small window of somewhat peace in india for few decades, i munched on that opportunity and got out.

This is what I've noticed about India's ideal beauty standards for women.  To be rail thin in Indian culture is not a  “beautiful thing  for women”, people  mostly would look down at you and mock you if  you’re way too skinny,  they mostly prefer thick body or slim with curve  (but  not flat). It’s  not necessarily about how developed is the country, that  will affect  daily  lifestyle and so on. Furthermore, it is not that Indian women  don’t care about their  weight, it’s just that certain  women from first  world countries are too obsessed with being very skinny.  What I am  kind of right about is that it's much less common  for women in  poorer  countries(including India) to be concerned  about body image as its more of a  “first  world problem” and virtually  all South Asian countries are  third world/developing countries.",1582646640.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,2,13

2. The video had a predominant shade of green in it.
3. It was sung by a woman (or at least the chorus was sung by a woman).
4. The title of the song was a single word which was repeated in the chorus (Like 'Aag' but not it)
5. It was on a compilation album on which the next song was jay jay shiv shankar.

2779,"(CONFESSION) Kinda Stuck HereAlright people, my post might be a bit self-centered with all the chaos and bloodshed that is happening right now in our capital city. But, I really want to share this out here so as to get some good advice, feedback and discussions.

A few months back, I got a job in very nascent startup and been working there as a Graphic Designer. Tbh, I like everything about the role and the job that I get to do here, people appreciate, validate and respect the work that I am doing here - I have no complaints in that regard.

Sure, being a very new startup, there aren't much co-workers around and the very handful there are, are older to me by a generation or so and thus, we have almost little to none in common with each other. I am also the only designer in my department and thus, things tend to get very lonely for me, at times (though, I've been plagued with loneliness for years now). 

But these aren't a dealbreaker for me and aren't the reasons for why I have made this post in the first place.

The dealbreaker for me however, lies in the fact that I am expected to show up to work for all 7 days. 7\*365. Let alone this, I used to be the kind of person who loathed the idea of there being a 6-day working schedule (as one barely gets to do anything in that single day they get on a Sunday).

I mean, this was made clear to me during interview, when I enquired them about the weekends. And I understand, being a part of the food and beverage industry, the company is expected to operate 24\*7\*365, due to the kind of industry that it is part of.

I thought, after not being in a job for the previous year, my self-discipline and schedule went out of control and thought maybe working all 7 days will get back my old discipline as I thought that it will make me ""more active"" and ""less lazy"". 

And, I guess, I've been proved wrong all the while, simultaneously, my doubts have been proved true too, in regards to working all 7 days.

I struggle to get up early now, even despite getting sound sleep and going to bed early (I made a thread about this, a few days back here). I really feel burned out and am struggling to get my tasks done, due to not being able to focus and concentrate properly. I mean, I felt the burn-out in a mere months after I started working.

Again, I understand the kind of industry I am in, what I don't understand however, is why must I, a designer (well, I am a Marketing Analyst to be more precise, if that helps), needs to show up for all 7 days? I understand the production team needing to show up like that as well, F&B industry but even me too? Besides, the production team, most of them, reside nearby in a lodging whereas, it takes me 40-50 minutes to reach my office and home.

I took a day-off today and whatsapped my boss even, telling him that I need this break as I have been struggling to do my tasks for the past few days for which, he understood and granted.

And thus, I am feeling that this job is too much for me, the schedule at least. Which is sad, as I like almost every aspect of this job, being the only designer in my company, I also don't have any managers supervising or micromanaging ( I report to the CEO directly) and thus, I am bestowed with full control in what I get to do.

The timing is also not fixed. Boss seems like the kind of person who knows what he is actually doing and isn't egoistic, petty or tyrannical in any way.

I honestly don't think that I can get such freedom and privilege anywhere else . And that is why it pains me to share this post as despite all this perks, no matter how good and ""ideal"" a work is for someone, ultimately, there needs to be a break where I could have all the personal time that I crave for and where once, just for once, I don't need to wake up everyday with the thought that I need to go to work for that day. 

Sure, during Sunday I could leave for work earlier than usual but, it defeats the point of keeping it in the first place, doesn't it? To only show up for a handful of hours, there is ample time to get whatever work there is left, in the remaining 6 full days.

My fear is also that, if i resign from this job, I don't think that I would get one anywhere else. Seeking for one for three full months prior to landing in this and eclipsing this from my parents (mother especially, as I feel that they tend to give a typical, Boomer-esque advice that doesn't help me at all and only infuriates me further) was already a cruel and painful experience, man. 

I would quit this in a heartbeat if my mother is an understanding and supportive type. Expect, she is very emotionally abusive and neglectful and will never (and has never in the past too) ever, provide me the support that I want (and even deserve maybe). She will at best, be neutral and at worst, be antagonistic towards me (and she's like that too to both my Dad and sibling).

Based on the feedback I get (and deep down personally), I know that I am not a bad designer, if I try and put effort. And yet, I was sucking in all the interviews that I attended prior. Was it because I am a fresher? I don't want to go to the whole ordeal again.

And thus, I feel like I am stuck here. I am sorry for the long post, but wanted to let this out in the hopes that others can hear and understand the predicament I am in, right now.

TL:DR - Graphic Designer (Marketing Analyst, actually) working for almost 3 months now. Satisfied with everything else, though need to show all 7 days in a week due to the industry and thus, is gradually taking a toll on me. Afraid of quitting and finding a new one in the fears that I won't get any, because of being a Fresher no matter how competent I might be. And also in the fears that I won't get the perks and privileges (that I've described in this post) that I am enjoying here.",1582636268.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,17,33

2853,"The problem with current CAA protests - from a right wingers perspectiveNote: The post is based on the fundamental premise that India needs to meet these objectives,

a. Secure borders and eliminate any illegal immigration 

b. Deport any illegal immigrants 

If you do not agree to these points, viz. you strongly believe in open borders, we cant have any meaningful discussion - and just agree to disagree. 

Post: The current problems with the CAA protests as I perceive them,

1. Blanket refusal stating 'kagaz nahi dikhayenge' - this is not a great stratgey. Rather, there should be solid proposals from them on how to meet the objectives stated above. If NPR and CAA are unacceptable, what should be alternate methods to achieve these objectives? 

2. Citizenship extension to all illegal immigrants except muslims - this obviously is the crux of the matter, because this aspect clearly discriminates between ilegal immigrants based on their religion. The question then becomes, are anti CAA protestors, protesting on the behalf of Hazaras, Ahmadis and Rohingyas? If so, India already has a system in place to naturalize persecuted minorities so I dont understand why this is such a contentious issue. 

As I see it, albeit with all my biases, the protests  are a boiling over of the suppressed anger against 370, Babri, triple talaq and the soon to be uniform civil code. Also center/left leadership are inciting fear of minority deportation, for political gains. 

Tl;dr - rather than seemingly directionless and rigid protests, anti CAA movement should come up with alternate(s) on a better way to achieve anti--illegal immigration objectives.

*** 

Seeing that the thread has crossed a 100 comments, now is as good a time as any to summarize things and give a final perspective from my pov,

1. While there was a great deal of participation and discussion, it mostly centered around why the CAA+NRC must be repealed as a whole, without any real, better alternative that could meet the objectives 

2. It was clear that there is a great deal of fear and anger over the suspicion that legal muslim citizens will be deported enmasse, but as to what evidence this sentiment is based on was quite unclear 

3. There were also multiple occasions when participants wanted to challenge the premise of stricter immigration laws and whether they are even a truly pressing issue - to this all I want to say on this point is that while there are economic arguments on both sides, this is also an emotive issue for RW folks like me, it is not necessary that it make a strong economic case (which I strongly feel it does). Whether you choose to agree or disagree, it is important that we understand each other on this, personal attacks online or now as we are seeing in the real world, will only dilute and belittle the anti CAA stance. 

If nothing else, this thread helped me better empathize with those of the opposing view, at least their fears and motivations.

3047,"[Unpopular Opinion] People supporting Anti CAA protest with the picture of Gandhi should learn from himDuring Non-cooperation movement in 1920 against the  Rowlatt Act. When moment started to become violent with the first initiation at [Chauri Chaura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauri_Chaura_incident). Gandhi decided to end the moment. It doesn't matter if a single person in the crowd was stupid enough to start a riot like situation, but when even a single incident takes a life it creates a  dent on the image of your moment, you can no longer support a moment.

Even people on randia trying to save the cause by saying Kapil Mishra did this. Even if he did this, there is very high possibilities that other side was also there. And it is not a first incident, no one is good out there.  Plus there is no face, there is no vision for the moment, where it is going, what is there next move. It is nothing but a chaos.  There will be no conclusion, that's the hard truth. There is extreme ends on the both the sides, only they will win and looser will be people like  you and me and the house wife's sitting there thinking that there will be a resolution.

History is witness no moment was won by chaos and without a face and a vision it will lead to bigger riots than ever.

Me (19) or my family (consisting of my parents and my younger brother) does not have medical insurance.   


As per my research, treatment for this condition costs around 50k in total and my family has 0 savings. Hence, investing in an insurance to cover the costs for this seems a better option than spending a whole 50k which we do not even have. Or is it a bad idea?  


I have no idea about where to start looking or what to look for. I tried, but I got confused with floater, mediclaim, room costs, etc. Now I know that most insurance have a waiting period for pre existing conditions, but I also do not know much about it and how it will affect me in my current situation.

The only thing I know about the biscuits is that they were in packaging that was in Indian (not sure if it was Hindi or Kannada or another language sorry) and had ziplock and I think the packet was white and green. The busicuts themselves were wrapper individually and were like healthy, ginger and dark chocolate biscuits. They were bought in Bangalore if that helps.This is all I was told about them, so I know it's a long shot, but I figured it was worth a shot.

I stopped living with my immediate family a while back. They love me and I love them. I rely on them for support, guidance and have an unswerving commitment to them. But the environment at my home is toxic. Quarrels are common. Rather they're an everyday affair, manipulation isn't unheard of. This surrounding was draining me. I had seen my father devolve because of this toxicity. I was afraid of facing a similar fate. Hence I seperated and started living on rent. I'm still a student. It led to a drop in standard of living but there's peace.

Thing is that my family members want me back especially my grandparents. There's deterioration in their health. I love them to bits. But spending a long time with them tires me and I experience the same with my father. They're eternal pessimists. But I make it a point to meet them twice a week.

3213,"What I have understood about the protests and the LawsWe all know that no one is against CAA, but everyone is against any linking with NRC. Because CAA is not going to take away citizenship away

BUT

# What Happens when someone has all documents-

Simple, nothing happens, you continue to be a citizen of India as you are intended to be

# What is you do not have papers-

1- If you are hindu, CAA will provide you citizeship

But what is you are muslim

2- If you are muslim and have no papers

a) CAA won't help you to give citizenship

# BUT

b) The usual law which is used to provide relief to refugees, regardless of religion will play here

So the crux is - If you are Hindu, CAA will act as a shortcut to citizenship

But if you are muslim, the usual old law of providing relief to refugees will be applied

# No one is being kicked or killed or removed for the country

Then you might ask, if no one is being kicked or removed, they Why NRC,

The answer is- To identify and provide proper data of all citizens as being illegal immigrant will keep the poor away from all sorts of BPL and other facilities for poor.

Plus, legalising all citizens will help the government to have a better idea of population as well as other stuff.

# BUT That only happens if NRC is implemented !

As we all know, not even a bench or even a draft has been made on NRC .

On this you might say, But Amit Shah said, NRC is coming-

But PM said, it is not coming.

To explain this, lemme give you an example. Suppose I was married in 2018 and got divorced in 2020.

So now, what is my martial status? - DIVORCED, see?

The NRC statement by Amit shah was spoken by him in rallies in DEC and Jan . PM spoke about NRC being not implemented in FEB.

So what is the current status? - NRC IS NOT BEING BROUGHT.

I have two doctors in my family and I've seen the working conditions of doctors in government hospitals and it is not even close to what doctors deserve after attaining such reputed degrees. In addition to that, there is very poor security for the doctors and many doctors across the country have been killed by angry mobs. I also think it's necessary to mention how the maximum percentage of the patients in these government hospitals live with this orthodox thinking that if there's a male person treating them, it's a doctor and if it's a female doctor treating them, they'll call her nurse even if they're told that she's a doctor. 

It's just so sad that even though there are so many NGOs working for patients suffering from serious issues, not a single organisation is working for the doctors. If anyone knows any such organisation anywhere in the world, please let me know. Thank You!",1582521935.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,9

This is a long shot but I need your help finding a sharbat (or concentrate maybe) that I tasted only once in my childhood and then haven't seen it ever after. The taste was something like that of elaichi (cardamoms) and the concentrate of that drink was dark green in color. I distinctly remember it had something like ""Timton"" written on the bottle and was kept next to a Ruh Afza bottle in the refrigerator, so it seems it was a concentrate to be mixed with water or milk and then drunk.

Had extremely extremely high social anxiety, 0 confidence, followed by crippling depression. Ideas like I will never be able to earn money etc. Now: social anxiety is so less, its completely crazy.  Almost gone is several cases.

Realize depression, anxiety WILL go away. You are wrong if you think your anxiety can't go away or you won't be confident. Same with depression, curable. Get this in your head.

Things that actually really worked with me:

1. Sunlight! My psychiatrist told me. 1 hr daily. Direct sunlight on your head, neck areas, ideally within 3 hrs on waking. He also suggested about an option of buying some lights that do the same thing.
2. Sleep schedule is very important !! Cannot be stressed enough. Something I ignored for years! Even now its not perfect. But wake early after 7-8 hrs of sleep. Wake at 6AM, go outside in the morning breeze.
3. Exercise. Strength exercise specifically. At least for me. Its not about muscles. Your body, you, feel different. I didn't know back muscles could be flexed. Don't attempt to rush it though. Make it a medium term plan to become physically stronger. Start slow, stretch, jog, walk. Avoid injuries. took 4-5 months to feel results. 

Confidence is not magic. Nor is depression a mystery. Think scientifically. Human body has evolved for millions of years in a certain environment - with open areas, lot of sunlight, doing hard labour. In the absence of sunlight, living in a cave with a weak body, our body is in unknown waters. Issues are bound to happen imo.",1582481733.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,16,62

3506,"How/Where to live a peaceful life in India?Hi, I've pretty good salaried job in Bangalore. But I never liked any city in India. It's noisy, polluted everywhere with people always trying to take advantage, especially if you're an outsider. I haven't been to all the cities in India but I've been to Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Mumbai and Bangalore. It's the same everywhere and I hate when people are so cutthroat and loud etc. I always feel like may be I should migrate to Canada or something. I don't wanna earn much, just enough to get by but just want to have a good quality-of-life. I even got breathing issues and such after working in Bangalore.

Is there someway I can move to some calm/peaceful area within India? Because I really don't wanna go out of India. I don't think I earn that much to have an early retirement either. So probably some decent job in less brutal setting within India. Or is it too wishful? For reference I can probably save upto 50k per month and I work as a networking engineer. Any thoughts?

Edit: I am from Kerala, thought I'll mention that since first few suggestions are Kerala. I feel like it's tough to get a job there in public sector.

3513,"Does the National Anthem, Go against the fundamental Secular nature of our Country?Our National Anthem- Jana Gana Mana... with all due respect is nothing, but just an act of praising the ""Leader"" who has written the ""Fate"" of our country. Then it goes on to describe the geographical features of our country, then it says that the very ""Chant"" of his ""Name"" awakens the people, and we are supposedly asking him for ""Blessings"".

This excuse for an anthem instills : 

* The idea of a figure above us.
* The idea of praising such an imaginary figure.
* The idea that this figure has the fate of our country in his hands. (Gods' own people concept which breeds racism)
* Chanting such figures name for awakening, some sort of mantra.
* Asking for blessings from such a figure

One of my cousin’s colleagues in Wipro is in need of an urgent kidney transplant and the colleagues have gone ahead and created a Milaap page for him. He has been with Wipro for 11 years. 

##A Brief 

One of our friends is facing a serious medical exigency for about a few weeks now as detailed below:
Background: Gaurav Khera is working with Wipro from last 11 years. He is married and has one Daughter. His contribution to the business is highly commendable.
Everyone around him admired his fortitude and energy. ""Everyone he worked with has only good things to say about him. He never speaks badly about people no matter how much they hurt him. He always wants to make the best out of any situation and focus on what can be done,""

**Medical Condition**: He is admitted in QRG Hospital, Faridabad for treatment. He is diagnosed with Kidney failure and has to undergo dialysis once in two days. His wife, 6-year-old daughter and aged parents are dependent on him but he is too weak to work. He needs a kidney transplant to get better before he succumbs to the condition.

**Help Needed**: Due to the high expenses being incurred during his treatment over the last couple of weeks, the existing insurance limit has been exhausted and his family is in need of funds. His efforts and his strength will all be in vain if he succumbs to kidney failure. Your support will help Gaurav save himself and his family.

We believe that while they are managing the more crucial aspects of the situation we can help with their financial burden. Help support our colleague by keying in your contributions Situation
He and his family would appreciate any support we can provide.

I am a student from IIM Kashipur, and this must be quite the nerve-wracking time for some of you. Entrance interviews and the pressure of converting the best B-Schools in India. Just that - be sure of what you want.

Unfortunately, in the race to get ahead, we have mugged up answers to standard interview questions and we know how to convert these colleges, we just don't know what we want. And entering a B-School with that uncertainty? With that fee structure? It might not be the best choice 

For those with the aptitude, MBA is a lovely course. You understand how the world works and it is a bubble-breaking experience. But don't see it as a pedestal to a higher pay package.

Every placement report is faked - quite a lot in some cases, so be careful.

Thought I'd book her a Uber to the hospital and back since she is mostly mobile and the visit shouldn't take very long (just giving a blood sample). Could have got away with booking a regular Uber go (since the hospital is like 4 mins away) but I wanted grandma to have the peace of mind and booked a Hire go for an hour to take her there and back.

The driver reaches location, grandma gets in and he's off to the hospital. On the way there he tells her that he will drop her off and leave. Panicked, she calls me and asks me to speak to him. I ask him why he would accept a hire go trip if he didn't want to wait the hour and he straight up tells me he won't wait and that he wants to go for other trips. I ask him why he wouldn't inform this before grandma got in and that it wasn't nice to do it to an old lady, that too on a hospital visit but he was very arrogant and didn't listen. I call the Uber emergency support immediately but the driver had already took the money and left (grandma relented because he kept arguing). So I ended up getting charged a couple hundreds for a 1.5km ride and then got to deal with the hassle of arranging a ride back while comforting an anxious grandma....

I raise a support thread in the app and there is no response for till today so I reach out to their [twitter](https://twitter.com/Smf1503Malhotra/status/1231518216049979392?s=20) support. They then give me a generic reply on the app and basically shrug off all responsibility. I've written to them [again](https://twitter.com/Smf1503Malhotra/status/1231580402382295040?s=20) but I have to say, I do not have high hopes. Would appreciate if some of you could weigh in and help bring their attention to it.

Why does one pay the premium for the hire trip if they still won't fulfil their obligations? Guess I am to blame too for being so over-reliant on these services but never expected such underhanded behaviour from them.",1582467491.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,22,83

&#x200B;

Need some urgent help! My sister and mom stay at our native and dont have much knowledge about modern-day scams. 

My sister shopped some clothes from some xbaazar (dot)com.  Got the wrong products delivered and asked the delivery guy to take it back. The delivery guy said to call the company and they will refund the amount.  This site has no customer care number but google does mention some random numbers. She calls one of them and this is how it goes now. 

My sister did that, the dude (mobile number) asked that he will pay via UPI. My sister doesn't have one so she gave UPI ID of my mom's friend. So, she gives it and then he asks for the bank accounts last 4 digits. She goes ahead and gives it. He asked for UPI Id, she did not give. 

&#x200B;

Now, the guy calls and abuses and says he has the details for all the bank accounts linked with my mom's friend. 

&#x200B;

Can he withdraw any money? How do we stop this? (Yes, they won't give any OTP) and also, moms friend is transferring money in her hubby's account.",1582368297.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,15

3852,"Math regarding the Gold Ore found in UP.So we all heard about the 'jackpot' gold which is more than 5 times India's reserve. I wanted to drop some numbers to let everyone know about the truth.

On an average a tonne of ore will give you anywhere between 3 to 25 grams of gold. 

Here is a link worth reading. https://www.mining.com/highest-grade-gold-mines-2017/

Now, let's assume that this is the best ore ever!!! and we get 25 grams per tonne. The ore 'jackpot' is 3350 tonnes as per the reports. 

so 25 x 3,350 = 83,750 grams.

83,750 grams = 83.75 kilograms. 

Now, latest price for gold per kilo is Rupees 3,799,308.97 which is approximately 38 lakhs.

Now 38 lakhs x 83.75 = 318,250,000 rupees

this is 31 crores, 82 lakhs and 50 thousand rupees. 

So whatever they found, if extracted will be not more than 31.82 crores. 

just my 2ç

But, now I’ve got so used to listening the same shit over and over and over again that I quit. Look it’s been three to four fucking months since the protests against CAA-NRC started. The governing bodies do not give a fuck and haven’t listened to the people. Police attacks Jamia Milia Islamia/JNU while on the other side the police took no actions on a guy yielding a gun have left me kind of hopeless. News doesn’t affect me now, it’s the same shit everyday. I find it funny now, just seeing the idiocy of everything. If people can follow people saying utter shit.. well... never mind I’m out of words.  

Oh, one last thing, here’s a song I really like to share in a time like this:  

___

*Oh, their religions are the best*  
*They worship themselves yet they're totally*   *obsessed*  
*With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks,*  
*these unbelievable outfits*  
*And they get terribly upset*  
*When you question their sacred texts*  
*Written by woman-hating epileptics*  

*Their languages just serve to confuse them*  
*Their confusion somehow makes them more sure*  
*They build fortunes poisoning their offspring*  
*And hand out prizes when someone patents the*   *cure*  
*Where did they find these goons they elected to* *rule them?*  
*What makes these clowns they idolize so*   *remarkable?*  
*These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new*   *gods*  
*So they can go on being godless animals*

3934,"Is It Possible To Get My Short Comic Get Published In India by a Magnize (digital or print) ?First of all this don't comment reddit has become quora lol (i have no idea where else i could have asked )

so a little backstory , this comic is close to completion and will be 3-5 pages lol ,drawn in a more manga-ish style .the story as a whole is just a slice of life and i have no idea what others might think of it as in if it will be good or not although i really think that it will  rock (based on real events ie. how i got my first kiss)

so that is what it is for now, i plan to update this post later when the comic is finished .. the main purpose of this post is to get to know/learn more about publication and magnizes as i don't have much knowledge about how they operate(google wasn't very helpful) or if i am extra lucky i might be able to get in contact with an editor or a publishing company (haha)

ps for extra context - i am 19 yrs old will be 20 in may , delhi based , the comic will be B&W ,trying to become an animator and make comics from time to time (old ones sucked)

3941,"The reducing age for achievement and success. Or is it a myth?* not intended for software/tech folks*

My cousin is 35 now. Studied at a tier 1 college. Got a good job. Did his MBA abroad. Got a decent job. Came back to his parents to care for them. But now, he mentioned something really worrying. He says that he is an underachiever. He earns around 25lpa, which is pretty good in India in any city, but he says kids aged 22 are earning more than him, from the same college, from the same department, in the same roles. 

I can vouch for that. The job I joined some years ago as a fresher paid around 15lpa. Today, that same job pays over 25lpa, and I am in another company earning a similar salary despite 5 years of work ex. It seems like companies in india prefer Freshers more than any one experienced. This is so wrong.

It is also a general trend. We often see people who are just a few years younger than us doing better financially and materially. My boss said that what he achieved at 50 is now normal at 30 and he is worried, because companies cannot  pay 1 cr to a 35 year old jist because he or she started at 25lpa ar 22 years old. It seems absurd to him, and he worked at US companies for over 2 decades (went there for a PhD).

 This is a completely distorted society, market and mindset. People over 30 are struggling to find jobs because companies can hire kids with 0 experience.

Two possibilities.
1. companies are doing shit work that does not require experience, maturity or leadership skills. 
2. Professionals in India are more fungible to their developed world counterparts.",1582346513.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,8,33

3954,"Can anybody explain me where left and right of India actually stands about Kashmir?I am super confused and late about Kashmir issue. I don't know much about it, just followed the news and politicians and people, and I am confused as to what exactly does the left and right think about Kashmir and what is exactly different about them.

As far as I understand the issue, Kashmir is a Muslim majority state which has a history of insurgency as well as Indian government suppression. I also know that there are people in Kashmir who wants to be with India, who wants Kashmir  to be independent and who wants Kashmir to be part of Pak (I don't know their proportions though). 

What I don't understand is where the left and right stands regarding this. I have seen right wingers celebrate the fact that Kashmir is a part of India and strictly wants it to be a part of India. But they also hate Kashmiris a lot. Just a few hours ago I saw a right winger meme about how all Kashmiris are anti-nationals and how they should be sent to Pak. Regarding the left, I am even more confused. Some of them seem to like the idea of Kashmir being integrated to India but don't like the process how it has  been done by the BJP government. Some of them seem to defend the Indian government. Some of them defends or at least  sympathizes with the insurgents saying their cause is justified. I have seen some posts who wants independent Kashmir, independent from India. Some wants bifurcation of Kashmir. I am confused.

What is actually the stand of the left and right? Does the right want Kashmir as a part of India or not? Does the left want Kashmir as a part of India or not? Does the left think Kashmir is better as an independent country? What's going on?",1582392106.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,6,8

Many people worldwide suffer from some sort of mental ailment. Among Indians there seems to be a scarcity of knowledge, misunderstanding and awareness regarding this topic. To make things more difficult, there are so many ignorant people who'd add their own half baked advice that one really feels helpless and angry. To make things worse, there's often mockery of people who suffer from some sort of mental health related issue.

I thought maybe it'll be okay if a list is created from various avenues to demystify psychology including various aspects of mental health for people of this subreddit who are interested in it, or have some issues.

First of all, THIS IS NOT JOB REQUEST OR APPLICATION OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

I just need help to get into the right direction.

NOW,    

I have successfully completed CEH a week ago and looking for a job. I contacted few firms and independent individuals in that field. But all of them say that they can't offer a job just because I don't have a past work experience in the field that they are offering ( Vulnerability Analysis/ PenTesting VAPT).

Some say that they don't want a guy who has Commerce background, they prefer someone from Science. Some want a guy with past work experience which I don't have. I do have strong knowledge in Hardware, Networking & Electronics as well as working experience in that field. 

Also, I met some guy who asked me to do freelancing (for free, YEAH) and work for him for at least 6 months without having to ask for money OR just take whatever I get. And that too with irregular timings for projects. I don't want to be disguised employed or taken for granted.

Other Info:-  I'm a B Com Graduate from Mumbai. I have 6 years experience of Accounting/Taxation/ Audits, Finalization, etc (Worked for Various Chartered Accountants) & 2 Years Experience in Hardware, Networking & Electronics. 

Now, the problem is 

1\] How do I get a job to get the experience required in the first place??

2\] Do you guys think there are firms who offer placements for a CEH fresher?

3\] What would be the minimum package if I get a job as Fresher?  (I know it would be way less than my previous, but it's okay. I just need a shift and want to do what I love to do.)

Any kind of help would be appreciated. 

Thanks for reading.

4021,"Best sweatproof foundation for hot humid weather
Moderators,  I'm sorry if this is not the right sub for this kind of subject, however, I dint post in the generic makeup subs because I wanted the audience to come up with the Indian brands. 

I recently relocated to a state which has a very hot and humid climate. Unfortunately, I tend to sweat A LOT in this kind of weather because of which, the foundation that I use currently has failed miserably.

4081,"Obtaining or bringing beedi in/to AustraliaHi r/India, I am Australian and recently married an Indian. I’m currently in India and will be bringing my wife’s parents with us to Australia in a few days for their first trip overseas so they can see what Australia is like (my wife studied in Australia and has a PR).

Her father likes to smoke beedi in the evening and I want him to be as comfortable as possible in Australia (he’ll be there for three weeks) but Australia is quite strict about tobacco products. You can bring up to 25 cigarettes in a single, sealed pack per person, with four of us that makes a total of 100, but beedi seem to come just wrapped in paper rather than as a proper “pack”.

Has anyone had any experience bringing such packs to Australia, or found somewhere in Australia that sells beedi? I was thinking otherwise to get a pack of loose tobacco and papers in Australia, but the beedis seem to be a lot thinner than a normal cigarette and I have no idea of the strength.

Her parents have never flown on a plane let alone visited a foreign country, so I really want to give them as many home comforts as I can to make them a bit more comfortable (my wife’s cooking is excellent so we already have roti-sabzi covered!).

As a side note, we’re flying Singapore airlines and plan to pack some home made parathas in case they don’t like the Hindu-veg meal offerings, has anyone experienced the airline staff giving them grief over bringing home food?

Don't suggest ask friends.

I watched some YouTube videos.

Instructor will not teach me. I have a bike and an empty ground to practice. I drove for few kilometers. I have no problem with balancing. I drove more than 12000 km on my excel. It's just the gear system is confusing.

Endorphins 

By playing video games, by working out, by songs, by doing things we enjoy.
It is for temporary period.


Oxytocin
Released after sex in warmth of women. Feels too good and like a pussy feeling.

Dopamine

People will do anything. Cocaine hijacks pleasure centres of brain, same for maladaptive daydreaming, even sadistic freaks who commit violence feel it.

Pleasure hormone are reasons we try new things and we are alive.


Testosterone
This a man's friend after leg day. Guarantees morning wood and erections. 
Makes man to be aggressive and if on no fap makes a man feel like fucking anything that is female.

Even if we win, more testosterone and more chance of playing a game.

People also need adrenaline.


Basically all our human life, we run behind secretions of such above chemicals in our brain.

Money, sex, success and anything pleasurable releases one of the above chemicals.

4286,"Loan and interest is unpayable after my dad's demise, need financial advice if any possible,Mods thanks for letting me post here, but if there is a more appropriate place I should be posting this, rather than here let me know,

Okay, now here's the story, My dad passed away last November and since then it has been a problem to maintain our bills, and it certainly doesn't help that we are under a big home loan, which my dad and mom took couple of years ago, and wasn't able to pay because my father lost his job then, he did try to get a job now and then... And he manage to earn some money to help with the loan, and mine and my sisters study.. my mom also used to work 2 shifts (9-10 hours) 2 different jobs... 

But now the situation after my dad passed away is..

- I m a student grade 12,
- And my mom only works one job in the morning, because she isn't comfortable anymore..

- my mom's salary is less than the amount we should be paying for the loan per month

- he didn't have any life insurance
- the money my mom earns, goes into helping with bills, maintainance, etc. My school fees

- I do have my grandparents with ample amount of money to help us, but for what ever reason they aren't helping right now, it could be the fact if he helps with such an high amount, the members in the family might expect him to divide his wealth next, And I personally don't want that kind of strain in our family.. so we aren't pushing that idea home..

-And the problem is not the home loan, but the other loan we took from different banks to pay are existing loans, (bad decision, i know)

Anyways what i want to know is, that if their is any way we could be helped in this situation, with any law or a program launched by government of some sorts, i just need financial advice on what should be the next step, so their is not a lot of burden on my mom... 

I will be glad to have any help🙏😔

4303,"Another IIT researcher from Roorkee commits suicide(probably because of depression)I was reading a Hindi newspaper and came across this news

https://www.amarujala.com/amp/shimla/civil-engineer-apurav-sood-commit-suicide-hails-from-chamba-himachal-pradesh

His suicide note states

‘**दुनिया भरी पड़ी है, एक मैं चला जाऊंगा तो कोई फर्क नहीं पडे़गा’**

which roughly translates to 

**""The world is full of people. It won't matter if I leave this world""**

Full translation of article

""Apoorva Sood, a civil engineer living in Mohit Nagar, committed suicide by hanging himself.  In the suicide note, the engineer has not held anyone responsible for his death.  However, as mentioned in the suicide note, 'the world is full, one will leave me, it will not make any difference' is enough to tell the pain inside.  **After doing MTech from IIT Roorkee, he was doing research at Uttarakhand State Application Center.**

Panditwadi resident Anirudh Gujral reported at Vasant Vihar police station on Saturday that tenant Apurva Sood resident Chotra Chamba (Himachal Pradesh) committed suicide by hanging himself in his brother-in-law's residence in Mohit Nagar.  The police arrived at the scene and investigated.  Apoorva Sood was hanging on the fan making a loop of sapha.  The body was taken down after videography.

Natthilal Uniyal told that Apoorva Sood (27) was currently doing research at Uttarakhand State Application Center after doing MTech from IIT Roorkee.  The suicide note from the room reads that there is no fault of anyone for suicide.  Post mortem will be done on arrival of family members.""

Do I have any recourse?Hi, I bought a phone while travelling in India almost a month ago. My main concern was that it would work abroad, which I was repeatedly assured it would. Even went back a second time as my foreign sim seemed to be blocked, but the store clerks told me it just didn't work in India and would be fine once abroad. I've been in contact with their customer service for the past 2 weeks which has basically been useless. I have to follow up every few days just to get a reply, they've lied saying I was  told that the phone only accepts a certain type of sim card (this isn't the issue as I have the correct type, but getting that email correspondence annoyed me when they said no such thing in their eagerness to sell) and they still haven't provided any kind of solution, it's been 5 days since they last replied to my email.

Do I have any recourse from abroad other than adding to the list of 1 star reviews? I currently have a useless phone and the lack of attempt to help is annoying. I bought at a high street store as I thought it'd be more reliable than a random market vendor, but seems I should have just went to a vendor. I'm almost tempted to fly back to return the phone on principle as a flight is cheaper than the phone, but it's hardly worth it.",1582274175.0,,,dark,15,27

4464,"Recently told Mom about inter-caste boyfriend and all hell hath broken looseI'm 27yo female dating a 28yo male from a different caste (both UC Hindus, if it matters). I've had a great childhood, my parents have been very liberal about most things except the fact that I get married outside the community. That's all they've ever asked. As luck would have it, recently told my mother about my north-Indian boyfriend and she is shocked. Told me they will never accept this, especially my father, who she said might commit suicide. She hasn't even asked me questions about my boyfriend,  just says ""we don't accept this, you can do what you want"". She is not one for emotional reactions or drama (which I would honestly prefer at this point), just says ""No, not happening."" That's it, and she is supposed to be the more reasonable one. I managed to wheedle some information  that might matter to them in while talking, including how much he makes (""Don't run after money, not important!!"") and that his family is on-board (""then do what you want, we don't accept it, it will never happen!!""

Telling my father is going to be a whole other event. He cares even more deeply about the caste, can be counted on to always have an emotional reaction than a reasonable one. Logic almost always eludes him. I'm actually worried about his blood pressure when I break this to him. The hypocrisy is strong because I found out about his affair, but that has conveniently been forgotten. I don't want to use that as ammo but might have to if it gets out of hand.Also, my relatives are pieces of shit. My brother lives in the US and had a inter-caste marriage himself, but they use that for ""he has done this to us already, you can't do this as well. We'll become the laughing stock of the family"" My brother has done his bit by trying to talk to Mom and is supportive, but that's doesn't seem to be helping.

I'm successful, make decent money, am financially independent and am living in a separate apartment even with my parents in the same city because it's closer to work. My boyfriend is extremely smart and successful, makes more money than my parents can fathom and is genuinely, obviously the nicest guy. I'm convinced if they meet him, they will find no reason to fight this, but I'm sure they will refuse to meet him for a very long time.

My parents and I don't usually fight, unless we're discussing politics. The fact that my mother is being cold and the fear of telling my father is honestly too much to take and beginning to cause a strain on my interactions even with my boyfriend, who is doing everything he can to be present.

4487,"Is it ""alright"" to take a break after college?I graduated from college in June. Since then, I've done nothing.

When I mean nothing I'm not sure... As in I joined the gym in July, and it really 'clicked' for me only in November. I am not muscular but I'm getting there....I think. My form in mostly all exercises is really good now.

I also rejected 3/4 book ideas. Only now do I have one that I actually think I can write. Compelling enough.

And then I also am learning French, on the B1 level. I did very very well on A1, A2 levels...hopefully I'll do well in B1 and B2, too. 

Why did I take this break? Well. To be honest, my mental health has been incredibly poor. Throughout my life. I've been suicidal for 8 years, and I have attempted in the past; only 2 years ago did I muster up the courage to meet a psychiatrist and a psychologist... But that didn't work out. I also lost my dog in August and honestly... He was the only constant in my life. I'm not even exaggerating.. He really was. Everyone, except a few sensitive people, think this is nothing - he was just a ""kutta"" after all, sigh. This is very personally angering for me and honestly the messy circumstances around his death also have caused a deep standing resentment between me and my parents. 

Over the last few years I've also lost 2 close relatives, one of them a part of the immediate family. It has been hell, for the family. I think about it every day. 

But I just keep asking myself... Is it alright? It's no secret that the mental health of Indians is abysmal, yet most keep working through it. And everyone keeps trying to get me to do an MBA or sit in the UPSC exam... 

A few ""well wishers"" have found interesting ways to tell me that French and gym is good and all but no one in the real world gives a flying fuck. This is promptly followed by examples of people clearing the UPSC, getting jobs etc.. 

You guys can be honest and tell me if it just seems like I'm wasting away my time locked up in my room 24/7 and doing nothing except these two things for which I occasionally step out. I don't mean for this to be an echo chamber of validation, but i just want opinions. All my relatives keep pressuring me when this is the first time I have had to myself.

Why is it such a big deal, honestly? I hate it. Why do Indian relatives have to be all up in our business 24/7???!!? I am very isolated and they find ways to get to me through my parents.",1582247020.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,16,38

Kids from good colleges struggle to make more than $600 a month, houses are so expensive, water scarcity is rampant etc. Why do people want more than 1 kid at all? Or even one? Why not just adopt? 

So many children are at orphanages in India and deserve a better life. Yet, people go to any extent, including things like artificial insemination etc, to get kids. I do not get it. The replacement rate for any population is two kids per person, and India is already at 1.3+ billion, perhaps more unofficially since census etc has lost its credibility under the BJP. 

Sterilisation should be incentivized for folks with more than two kids, and contraceptives should be made tax free. As I posted on another thread, the 30 year old Mali in our society earns 40 k a month, which is a decent amount, but has 4 kids already! As expected, he is from UP and so are the millions of migrant workers in construction, factories etc. Imagine how bad the life of these kids will be in 20 years when automation takes away all manual jobs! It is a disaster that can only be prevented by inentivizing sterilisation.",1582280387.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,191,254
4499,"Most/all Indian horror movies have some sort of backstory for the ghost/spirit.I'm a fan of horror movies and I've noticed that all the Indian horror films have a pattern. The so called evil spirits are given a justification for their wrongdoings and this just takes the suspenseful horror factor away from the movie. 
Exorcism based horror movies depict the spirits as an evil entity, however in Indian movies the spirits are a manifestation of the GOD ITSELF! Even many of the psycho/serial killer movies hooks up some sentiment to the killer, trying to justify his actions(not in a subtle manner). 

For example:
I have never seen an Indian movie similar to ""No country for old men"". The closest I could think of was ""Vettaiyadu Vilaiyaadu"" which is a Tamil movie about two psychos killing people. But in the case of pure horror, there are no movies similar to Exorcist, The exorcism of Emily Rose, The Blair witch project, 1408, Get out, Oculus, Uninvited or even the conjuring/Insidious/paranormal activity series..

 I don't understand why this pattern caught on, and I would love if someone could explain why the Hollywood horror movies are so different from an Indian horror movie (or am I just not watching the right kinda movies?).

What are my options?I am Indian national, I worked for a Big Tech company in Bay Area for 5 years before I quit my job beginning of last year to start a venture in India. After a year my startup failed to get any traction so I started to look for jobs in the Bay Area, I still have 1.5 years of valid H1B work permit (i.e. I have gone past the lottery stage, I just need a company to sponsor my case).

In order to visit the US I applied for a B1/B2 visa, I got a letter of invitation from a Big Tech company based in the Bay. My visa application got rejected citing section 214 (b) which meant that I have not shown enough ties to my home country so they consider me high risk. I do understand the apprehension, since I have only been formally employed in US and am basically unemployed in India, have no spouse or land owned in my name. My reason to visit is genuine though.

Most companies require a mandatory onsite interview. I was told I can reapply but I shouldn't expect much different results if my situation/documents don't change much.

  
I would like to know if there is possibility for me to get cleared through the B1/B2 process? Also should I be careful with reapplication as in does getting rejected twice in a B1 application hurt my H1B chances?",1582218499.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,7

https://preview.redd.it/40u2siswq2i41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=2329ec5235b03bd0b271ef0f07d4ca183ed988ae

### Tl;dr

Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) is being introduced in India without paying heed to the problems which may arise from its implementation. While the obvious problem is that a faulty system with a high error rate may be implemented, the implementation of an accurate FRT system also raises serious privacy concerns.

### Facial Recognition Technology: Process and Function

To understand the problems associated with FRT implementation, we first need to understand how FRT works. As Smriti Parsheera explains in her [**recent paper**](http://datagovernance.org/report/adoption-and-regulation-of-facial-recognition-technologies-in-india), the process can be summarised in the following steps:

1. Detection of face in an image and/or video. For instance, phone cameras apply this feature when they auto-focus on a face while capturing a photo.
2. Extraction of particular features from the detected image.
3. Recognition which results in either identification or verification of an individual.

Identification happens when FRT is used to identify an individual from a pool of many people. This kind of 1: many FRT based identification is typically used for security and surveillance purposes. Verification, on the other hand, occurs when an image is compared to another image from an existing database in order to verify that the individual is who he/she claims to be, i.e., authentication of identity on a 1:1 basis. 

### Implementation of a Faulty FRT System

Claims relating to accuracy of FRT systems are routinely exaggerated and the real numbers leave much to be desired. For instance, in 2018, Delhi Police [**reported**](https://theprint.in/opinion/indian-govt-approach-to-facial-recognition-flawed-driven-by-faulty-assumptions/327036/) that its FRT system had an accuracy rate of 2% which fell to 1% in 2019 with the system even failing to accurately distinguish between girls and boys. 

The implementation of such faulty FRT systems would lead to high rates of false positives and false negatives in this recognition process.

1. A *false positive* occurs when FRT gives an incorrect positive result wherein the system misidentifies an individual as someone he/she is not. This may lead to discrimination and strengthening of existing biases. For instance, [**ACLU**](https://www.aclu.org/blog/privacy-technology/surveillance-technologies/amazons-face-recognition-falsely-matched-28) found that Amazon’s facial recognition software “Rekognition” incorrectly matched 28 members of the US Congress with people who had been arrested for committing a crime. Of those members who were incorrectly matched, 40% were people of color which is a disproportionate number since people of color make up only 20% of the US Congress. 
2. A *false negative* occurs when the FRT gives an incorrect negative result wherein the system is unable to recognize an individual or authenticate his/her identity. This may lead to arbitrary exclusion of an individual from government schemes and benefits. Failure of biometric based authentication under Aadhaar has led to many people being excluded from receiving essential government services and even led to starvation deaths. Such problems will be further aggravated by an inaccurate FRT system.

In India, FRT systems are being developed and deployed by government and private entities without any technical standards in place which may lead faulty systems being implemented (Read more about these FRT projects [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/facial-recognition-in-india-part-i/)). Once in place, it would be very difficult for them to be reconciled with future technical standards and  damage like discrimination and exclusion would be impossible to undo.

### Implementation of an Accurate FRT System

While there have been [**claims**](https://swr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=3370&id=0,4,268) of a fully accurate FRT system, none of these claims have been corroborated by independent review and audit. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has extensively tested FRT systems for [**1:1 verification**](https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/11/20/frvt_report_2019_11_19_0.pdf) and [**1:many identification**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8271.pdf) and how accuracy of these systems [**vary across demographic groups**](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/ir/2019/NIST.IR.8280.pdf)**.** These independent studies have concluded that currently, no FRT system has 100% accuracy.

An accurate FRT system would *hypothetically* have a 100% success rate in 1:1 verification and/or 1:many identification. However, it will come with its own ominous connotations, the most problematic of which may be state led mass surveillance and difficulty for outside actors to counter-challenge government decisions. 

1. ***Lack of Informed Consent***  
Probe images for FRT systems are often collected by the police through CCTV cameras installed in public spaces. Individuals in a CCTV surveilled area may be aware that they are under surveillance but the assumption is that this surveillance is temporary. Use of CCTV in conjunction with FRT would mean their images will be stored for a longer period of time, if not permanently. This data will also be used to extract particular data points such as the facial features and other biometrics which the individual has not consented to sharing when entering a CCTV surveilled zone and these data points can be used to track future movements of the person. Therefore, integration of FRT with a network of CCTV cameras would make real time surveillance extremely easy.  
Even if individuals do consent to their images being processed by an FRT system, is this consent informed? For example, the Digi Yatra Program introduced in various airports is touted to be a voluntary initiative and has a [**policy**](https://www.civilaviation.gov.in/sites/default/files/Digi%20Yatra%20Policy%2009%20Aug%2018.pdf) which assures passengers that “personal data shall be obtained only for the specified lawful purpose, and shall not be further processed in any manner other than for that purpose or those purposes.” However, the same policy also contains an exception which allows sharing of passenger data with “any Security Agency, Bureau of Immigration(BOI) or other Govt. Agency” based on existing protocols. Individuals who have consented to having their information processed under Digi Yatra may often be unaware of this exception.  

2. ***Lack of legislation containing mandatory safeguards***  
Deployment of FRT at national and state levels without adequate legal safeguards is deeply troubling. Specific laws with regard to FRT and personal data protection do not currently exist in India. While a flawed Personal Data Protection Bill has been introduced in the Parliament (read more [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/its-the-final-countdown-kinda-saveourprivacy/)), there is uncertainty about when it will be enacted and implemented and how effective it will be in protecting the personal data of individuals. Under the current version of the Bill, wide exceptions have been provided to the Government for surveillance related activities. A strong data protection legislation is needed to hold these FRT systems accountable in terms of collection, storage and usage of data including sharing of data across government agencies and with third parties.   

3. ***Violation of Fundamental Rights***   
The implementation of an accurate FRT system would also violate fundamental rights by facilitating mass surveillance. For instance, there will be a chilling effect on the right to freedom of speech and expression because people will be wary of being prosecuted in case they express anti-government sentiments. Further, the right to freedom of movement would be hampered as mass surveillance would allow the government to track the movements of individuals in real time across the country. Finally, the right to privacy will be violated as  sensitive personal data which is collected by these FRT systems will be used by the Government without the informed consent of the individual. This would also hamper the individual from exercising the liberty to share their information in some contexts and remain anonymous in others according to their individual choice.

In conclusion, implementation of FRT systems in India has the potential of turning the country into a surveillance state. The problems that arise would not only affect the fundamental rights and civil liberties of individuals but also create mistrust towards any positive initiatives that the Government might undertake if no legal safeguards and best practices are put in place.

4580,"How do I get a job as SDE with no engineering degree?I'm studying BCA from IGNOU (distance) course. After spending 1 year in a regular course for the same program, I thought I should change to distance mode, use the extra time to learn good programming (stuff that's not taught in college). I didn't give enough attention to studies in my 11/12th, hence I am now stuck with this. But I believe that most companies ignore the degree and focus on my skills and experience. I will be graduating in 2022, I guess IGNOU does not have a campus placement option and I would not even think of it to have one. So, I will be on my own, to find a job.  

I have been juggling with Java, Javascript and Python. I am planning to drop python for now and continue focusing on Java and JavaScript. After Java, I'm planning for Android development and with Javascript, I'm planning to learn the basics of Angular, React, Node.js, etc and then specialise in one or two of them (preferably React and Nodejs).  

To improve my theoretical knowledge to fit right for the role of an SDE, I am going to start studying books that are suggested by ( https://teachyourselfcs.com/ )

I already have experience with personal web development projects and have good experience with basics of websites, website security, web servers, databases (MySQL), etc. Unfortunately, I cannot put these projects into my cv for some reason. (1. these were silly projects which I made when I was a 16-17, 2. i do not have a backup of these projects)

Now my problem is, where to start and before that, how do I show the recruiters that I have these skills, basically what I'm asking is to please teach me how to find a job, make a good cv. Though I am not experienced, I believe that the interview part is for me to figure out by myself depending on how much I know.  

So, yeah. That's it.  

TLDR; Please guide me into building a good cv and finding a job as fresher SDE without an engineering degree.  

Sorry if the post feels too specific and a little dumb. I am in a dilemma regarding my plan and the path I'm taking. I believe this is the best place to ask this.",1582235113.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,2,13

I am curious to know why governments cannot give consulting services to India. I mean, Singapore, Japan and some small developed asian countries can teach a lot to the Indian babus about education, health and environment. These are much better countries than India and Indians could gain so much from their expertise. 

Even the few government level collaborations, such as Amravati and the bullet train project, have failed. Even foreign government firms cannot work in India. 

Why is it that India does not learn from the good things the neighbors do? I see Indonesia, Malaysia etc. learn from Singapore. China from the US and Singapore. 

Except the IITs, not many international education collaborations have been successful in India.

My hypothesis is that Indian babus selected through the IAS by rote learning Pali and Political Science are incapable of leaving their secretariat servitude to look at innovation.

&#x200B;

Below are my options:

&#x200B;

**2018 Bajaj RS200**

(Pros: Great mileage, Sporty Looks, Cheap | Cons: Really hate the halogen Single eye headlights, and dim DRL)

Price: 80,000 (Used) - Mileage: 75000 km

Price: 190,000 (New) - 2019 Model

&#x200B;

**2020 Dominar 400**

(Pros: Love the LED Headlights, Full LCD Cluster with abundant info and amazing exhaust Sound | Cons: Bad Fuel economy, Does not imitate a sporty look)

Price: 165,000 (Used) - Mileage: 10000 km, 2018 model - Did not like the LCD cluster of 2018 model compared to 2019 model.

Price: 300,000 (New)

&#x200B;

**Yamaha R15 V3**

Would love this overall, but too much hassle and unpredictable prices to import

Price: 225,000 (after import)

&#x200B;

**Kawasaki Ninja 300**

(Pros: Sporty Looks | Cons: Mileage and traditional reflection type Halo single eye lights

Price: 195,000 (Used) - Mileage: 5000 km, 2016

&#x200B;

Fuel consumption is important: at least 35 kmpl in highways

LED headlights - even aftermarket

4614,"How the CAA Issue is a Fallout of the Dual Citizenship IssueI suppose many of you (especially those resident to India) may not have noticed that **India has a serious ""issue"" regarding dual citizenship, which predates the CAA crisis, and which in fact led to the CAA crisis**. This is also in important read for outsiders who dont know much about India's arcane citizenship laws. To explain my line of reasoning, I am styling this post as a Q & A. All errors and omissions are mine.

**Why should there be an issue with allowing ""persecuted people,"" whether Muslims or non-Muslims to take Indian citizenship?**

There should be no justified objection. There is plenty of space in India.

**Then why was the CAA neccessary for this?**

Because in this case, the ""persecuted people"" were citizens of Pakistan. Indian citizenship laws were drafted in a manner that nationals of Bangladesh and Pakistan could never obtain Indian citizenship or migrate to India. There have been some exceptions, but this involves invoking mighty connections at the MHA. 

**Why were such restrictions put in place?**

In their ~~shortsightedness~~ bigotry those coming up with these rules seemed to think that only ""Muslims"" lived in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and any living being coming coming from those places would only be a Muslim (and would therefore be not welcome in India). On the other hand, Pakistan and Bangladesh do not seem to have imposed such reciprocal restrictions on Indian citizens (they don't seem to care).

**Why can't these persecuted people be allowed to keep their Pakistani/Bangladeshi citizenship while being given residency or a long term visa or ""Overseas Citizenship.""**

In their ~~shortsightedness~~ bigotry those making visa rules seemed to think that only ""Muslims"" lived in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and therefore they only would be coming to India on visas. Therefore there are no long term visas available to citizens of these countries. Even the short term visas have all sorts of restrictions and reporting requirements (visitors cannot leave the city they wanted to visit, they can only enter and leave through specific airports, they CANNOT work). ""Overseas Citizenship"" is explicitly not allowed to citizens of Pakistan and Bangladesh. 

India does not offer visas/residency to refugees. 

In effect, all these restrictions on 1. acquiring residency in India 2. acquiring Indian nationality effectively ended up making some poor Hindus who migrated from Pakistan to India **effectively stateless.** 

**Why can't these persecuted people be allowed to keep their Pakistani/Bangladeshi citizenship AND be given Indian citizenship?**

India (along with China and maybe 5 more countries) does not allow dual citizenship of any country! On the other hand, Bangladesh and Pakistan do, allowing their NRIs (which include many Hindus, such as [Ramesh Balwani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesh_Balwani)) to contribute substantially to their economies. 

**Why doesn't India allow dual citizenship?**

Because Mooslims....in their ~~shortsightedness~~ bigotry those making the rules believed they could cut off access of many Muslims who had migrated. In reality, they have cordoned off a group, consisting majority Hindus, who last year [remitted US $76.4 billion](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ez8c9o/as_per_the_data_received_from_indian_missions/) to India. You can easily imagine that this amount would be triple if these folks were allowed to retain their Indian citizenship. 

Secondly, Indian bureaucrats think of citizenship as a special favour, not a natural right...the equivalent of assigning a basic ""caste"" to people. And dual citizenship is expected to be practised in secret by Choksis, Hindujas etc (you only heard about their foreign citizenship after they fled), not ""everyday"" people. 

**Isn't it justified considering that Mooslims did Partition/9-11/Kashmir/Mughal invasion/temple trashing/killed my cat?**

Since the Partition was implemented by British India, the three countries created could have mitigated their losses (and the acrimony between each other) by allowing people who had been forced to migrate because of violence to retain the citizenship of the country they came from. It is not reasonable to expect a person who had lived his or her life in one place to start over again somewhere else. 

Just ask Advani. The reason he is so bitter with Muslims is because he was forced to leave behind the wealthy and established households that Sindhi Hindus had established in what is present day Pakistan. If suppose there was such an arrangement between the countries, and India did allow dual citizenship, maybe he would not have been so bitter. But again, this is a rather ideal scenario, applicable to a generation which no longer exists.",1582239828.0,,CAA-NRC,dark,2,13

 The woman, identified as Amulya Leona, was invited by the organizers of the event under the banner of ‘Save Constitution’ to address the gathering, soon after Owaisi came on stage, PTI reported. 

 “The statement made her (by the girl) is wrong. I’m not associated with it. My party does not support it. As long I’m alive, Inshallah, I will shout Bharat Ma ki jai” Owaisi said.

Don't  listen to BJP twats and WhatsApp videos with the misleading title, As far I could understand she was trying to say ""Hindustan Zindabad and  Pakistan Zindabad"" so that they also say that and there is peace between both the countries...

Also, advise if 5.5LPA is enough to live a decent life (I want to save as much time after a job to learn to program too hence I might not prefer travelling too much)

Please advise/guide me, where should I be searching for PG & how much will be the rent. (also, I don't have any problem in sharing PG)

Please guide.

4734,"To be humane. A few thoughts.There is a long context build up so please bear with me. 



Perhaps the biggest change that I have felt after growing up is coming in hands with reality. 


My family was pretty conservative but they never forced it onto me. Both my maternal and paternal relatives are socially conservative. 

My maternal grandfather was a doctor and was well off. He was posted as CMHO in a small town in Rajasthan, almost a village. 
Zee News had just started as a small news channel and my mom got an offer to work as an anchor there, very lucrative indeed. But for that she would have had to go out of town (maybe even state, I don't know for sure) for some sort of training and for that reason my Nanaji didn't let her go. She didn't question either. As a child she wanted to study Science  and become a doctor just like her father but then again my Nanaji didn't let her because she would have had to commute daily to a different town as at that time there was no school which taught science in the town. Two years later he got transferred to another town which did have schools teaching science and both of my uncles took onto studying science even though one was barely passing. My mother on the otherhand was stranded in a useless course of social science and later took onto doing a PhD in political science. Pretty useless. 



My dad on the other hand came from a very economically constricted family. They lived in a very small village barely scraping by with daily needs. He always had a knack for studying or so I am told. He left his village at the age of 16 and came to the city of Sikar to study further. Apparently his life was full of struggles where his father didn't want him to study but instead work as unskilled labour. I would not go into much detail but the family situation was indeed fucked up. When he was giving his civil service exams his mom got sick and had to undergo a life threatening surgery, the family, of course, couldn't afford it so he gave up all the scholarship money he had been saving, asked for loans from friends and got her operated one day before his exam. He did get selected though but not the post he wanted, I won't reveal what post he is on because I want to stay anonymous. But even after that the family situation didn't get better. He was forced into a marriage even though all he used to earn was 3K a month during his training period to feed a family of 8 siblings and two parents where the father smoked weed and did nothing to provide for his family. 



My parents' marriage wasn't very ideal to say the least, they had constant falling aparts, confrontations with family where apparently my father's family wanted dowry but my father refused to ask for it and then my mother was constantly nagged about it. My Nanaji helped them a great deal financially when he was in training though. My mother was a professor in a small college but my family didn't like that at all. 



All this paints a picture of a very conservative family but somehow I never had such confrontations. I was an only child and was kept far away from all this. It is surprising how my father who had an entire life of living in this environment managed to keep me away from it and also from himself. I always used to think the world is an ideal place where being good to each other is the norm except a few nutcracks here and there who created a divide. I went to a very expensive school and never realized that there is a difference between a Christian, a Muslim or a Hindu. Never did I ever think of women as 'women'. It is probably hard to imagine what I am trying to say. It was like there was no difference between a woman and a man or between a Hindu or a Muslim, they are all the same. But as I joined coaching insititutes I soon came to realization that a penis can create a seperation I had never seen. That someone's faith can change so much about a person's character. Sometimes when coming back home the Auto Rickshaw driver would ask me my surname and it sounds pretty cringy but I don't really have one. My parents decided that it will be better I just had a two worded name and not adopt their surname because we were of a lower caste. So when I would tell the driver my second name, he would get a little confused and ask me if I were of this x caste and I would not know the answer. Soon I came to know which caste I belong to and the next time the Ola driver asked me, I told him quite normally that I am a Kumhar. And it was so astonishing and degrading that his attitude changed so drastically, as if I am some lower form of being. 



It was so surreal and unbelievable. Once my dad had a cook who had a hairstyle which resembled Shah Rukh Khan's and when I told him about it I thought he would see it as a compliment but instead he felt offended and said, ""Mujhe us mulle se compare karega kya?"" 


All this was talks of stories and movies for me and as a 16 year old when I realized that all this is real I felt very disfranchized. 


My dad had a Muslim friend who is into some pretty shady business as I recently learned but as a child I was so verbose with him. Every Diwali he would carry me on his shoulders into Aatish market and buy me a shit ton of crackers. But now I cannot see him the same anymore. I cannot see him just as a person. There is this identity that I have subconsciously associated with him that yes he's a Muslim. When I heard about the stone pelters of Kashmir I thought ""Okay, yeah these guys suck."" but now I see them as ""Okay, yeah those Muslim guys suck."" 


Everything could have been so much better if there wasn't this identity associated with them. Why cannot everyone just be humans? This realization to reality has corrupted me, perhaps ignorance is bliss, yes it is. Now whenever I read someone's name, I first and foremost link them with their religion, caste, sex and create a prejudiced mental image. 


Now I have to tell myself proactively that all religions are equal, are sexes and genders are equal, everyone is a human being, a person's character is defined by his work and not the name he was born with. But earlier I didn't have to, it came inherited, I didn't have to proactively tell myself otherwise. 


When we teach ourselves, our younger siblings, cousins, children that everyone is equal and their social identity doesn't matter we also teach them that deep down it does. It does matter and that is why we are taught otherwise. We have to constantly run a check that his religion doesn't matter, their sex doesn't matter, their caste doesn't matter because it doesn't come inherently. It teaches us that there is something inherently wrong with our society and we are part of the problem which is why we have to force ourselves to not be when instead all we should have been taught is that everyone is human and so are you. 



A similar situation is narrated by GoT actress Maisie Williams that when she was told about femenism, she was startled to know that there has to be a construct where women are given equal rights, that a person will be labeled as a femenist when they fight for so. That being a feminist is a unique label when it should be a normal person and a sexist. 




As a kid I was proud of our society that it is so diverse and intertwined, but I am not sure if I can say that anymore. 



And unfortunately, I am perhaps forever stuck in this web where I have to tell myself to be humane.",1582168564.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,36

The study aims to answer the question, “What are the socio-economic dimensions of dog ownership in India, and its relations to healthcare expenditures?” So, if you currently **don't** have or **haven't** had dogs in the past, you could enter your response.

**Research Objectives**

1. To conduct a profiling of dog owners with respect to family structures and cycles
2. To identify explicit costs of dog ownership
3. To identify reduction in healthcare expenditures of the owner (if any) due to companionship of a dog

Once again, **Please enter this survey only if you do not have dogs. Sorry for the bold. Had to be careful :)**

I mention kids specifically because they aren’t given much attention in this particular aspect. Between them spending most of their childhood in schools and their teachers not being trained or educated in psychological aspects, ie on mental disorders, how to identify them etc, I think these disorders go unnoticed and by the time they are adults, these disorders could grow or give way to other disorders which then become a huge trouble in later life.

So this something we are ready to talk about?

Are we lacking somewhere?

Can we make it better? How?

The house I currently live in is valued at over 2.4cr. I pay 42k as rent. 

Even after making 40L last year, these rates are just absurd to me. Yet, every new development coming up around me is 4-5cr minimum.

Who is buying all this property? And why is it there such a massive discrepancy between rent and sale value? In most cases, even with a generous downpayment, rent is 25-30% of monthly EMI.

4838,"The shit that is happening in Indian schools: forgery, cheating, and a failed generationMy mother is a teacher. She is going to a few schools as the external examiner for physics lab tests for the board exams. 

What she told me was shocking.

At a Government school, the principal and headteachers are openly giving more than average marks to students who cannot even write 1 line of theory, let alone do the experiments.

Many examiners receive phone calls about influential people's sons and daughters being there at the center and are directed to give high marks to them irrespective of whether their answer script contains anything at all. 

Worst of all, the state board exam papers have been leaked to all schools, and even private school principals force the teachers to share the questions with the class. The going rate for an exam paper is 2 lakhs. 

Mom says that kids who cannot add 2 numbers are declared ""pass"" in class 10 maths (she teaches physics and maths in class 9-10, does practical for 11 and 12). 

She is depressed seeing the state of the education system. I keep telling her to write a book about this.

  
When did our education system become so corrupt and inept? I know that marks don't matter much in the long run, but these kids with 0 knowledge will soon join colleges, and repeat the same. The integrity of Indians is compromised from such an early age, and that is the reason our country has a very dark and dismal future. 

&#x200B;

In case it matters, this is in a state board in west India. I am sure things are the same in other state boards, although probably better in the south. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Board exam papers being leaked, kids given free marks, influential kids getting marks for blank papers. Integrity is gone from the school system. India is mass-producing corrupt idiots at a rapid scale.",1582174067.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,126,321

4879,"The problem with Indian liberals is their inability to see the other side.Indian liberals have a very important role to play in the near future. They are driving awareness against communalism, economic  and social disenfranchisement and the erosion of India's constitutional values. 

However, I often walk away from conversations with them feeling that they are just too idealistic, extreme and unwilling to negotiate with the other side. 

An example- some AAP minister started doing a hanuman chalisa gathering in his area. A liberal friend said this is worse than bjp because they are cheating people, won in the name of education now doing religion, etc. 
What she does not understand is that politics and its ideals change according to the times. Today, Indians feel religion is important for their identity, and politicians have to support that feeling. Voters and citizens are not kids and you cannot tell a 40 year old man that hanuman chalisa is useless. Instead, it is better to partner with people and bring out the good in them. 

By sticking to academic ideals and refusing to engage with the other side, liberals are increasingly becoming a fringe element, supported mainly by the intelligentsia and harmed minorities. 

Note that had the minorities not been harmed, no minority would have been concerned about the Constitution etc, and thus they would never have supported the liberals. They'd have continued to support deeply exploitative leaders like Mayavati. 

It is time that liberals start respecting the surroundings, wishes of people and social changes, and come out of their academic construct of the world. They can debate famous philosophers, social scientists and theologists when they talk to fellow liberals who have a good education.

 For liberalism to get the support of Indian masses, people need to see it as an add on to their ideology, rather than a substitute.",1582163399.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,14,10

4949,"[SERIOUS] Please Help Me Understand Indian Tech Call Center Representatives (long question)It occurred to me that I might get some insight here on certain aspects of my interactions with India-based call centers. 

First and foremost I promise this is not a subterfuge to let me spill vitriol and racism against Indians under the cover of asking a question, even though some of my language and attitudes are racist and I created a new Reddit account for this post. I understand it is controversial and insulting, and this is what I am trying to work on.

I am really concerned about my level of negative expectations as soon as I hear an Indian accent when I need to interact with a company's call center. That was not always the case but, after many years in the tech sector and frequent interactions, I'm afraid I am now operating fully in the realm of my definition of racism: ""Someone who is not able to go past their initial expectations/familiarity/knowledge of behavior/ability/intelligence based solely on ethnic background"".

I know and work with many Indians in an academic and scientific environment and my interactions on those areas are -thankfully- untainted by my call center experiences, so I don't think I'm 100% racist. But there are certain things that constantly (95% or more) happen with Indian call centers that don't happen (at all or rarely) with other non-Anglo representatives, whether we are talking or chatting. And I know that some of it is explainable by poor education, poorly written scripts, etc. Specifically:

* Cannot recall a question I asked a few minutes ago.
* Cannot recall information given before.
* Give an answer completely ignoring prior information given before.
* Never ask follow-up or clarification questions to my concerns/issues (other than repeating my original question/concern).
* Rarely answer yes/no questions (once I am frustrated with open ended questions).
* Give yes/no answers to open ended questions.

The issue is not in these limited instances. It's the overall experience that I now feel and react as if I am dealing with someone trying to cover up their stupidity and ineptness - and my attitude is no longer on a case-per-case basis but triggered by the Indian accent on the other line.",1582128267.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,11

In other words, they're perfect for manipulation by politicians with no qualms. Like Modi....and Kejriwal. 

Because that is what he is upto. He realised that if he gives soundbites about being Hindu, has his MLAs organise a Bhajan or two, and makes some loud boasts ***he has no ability or intention to carry out***.....they will be unable to realise it.

In other words, he is doing the same as what Modi did.

Using a superficial ""Hindu"" tag to appease dumbass voters, while he personally follows policies that make the RSS weep in horror.

Except *unlike* Modi, he is a secular party's leader. So there is absolutely no pressure on him to go through on his Hindutva appearing policies, and since he doesn't control the police, on his promises to remove the anti CAA resistance.

5019,"Treaty of Purandar: Dark chapter of Maratha ruleNot many people know but unlike the black and white portrayal of Shivaji and Aurangzeb done today, real history has more shades of grey.

**Battle of Pratapgarh and killing of Afzal Khan**

Back in 1659, on November 10, Khan and Shivaji met in private, unarmed, at the base of the fort to discuss the terms of the Maratha’s surrender.

In the Marathi bakhars, the tale goes that Khan resorted to treachery, attacking Shivaji with a kataar (dagger) hidden on his person. Parrying his blow, Shivaji hit back, disembowelling Khan with a concealed weapon of his own — a set of tiger claws.

In the Persian accounts of the Mughals and Bijapuris however, historians such as Khafi Khan claim Shivaji was the first to attack.

Who attacked first, however still remains a mystery.

The end result was that Shivaji ended up killing Afzal Khan. Immediately after, Shivaji’s forces attacked the unsuspecting Bijapur army in Par. In the ensuing Battle of Pratapgarh, victory came swiftly for Shivaji.

Afzal Khan was buried at the base of the fort and, chivalrously, Shivaji had a tomb constructed for him. Time passed, and the tomb became a local shrine for the area’s Muslims.

Does the act of making a tomb shows guilt by Shivaji or was it out of respect? again we will never know.




**Treaty of Purandar - June 11, 1665**:

Shivaji signed the agreement after Jai Singh besieged Purandar fort. When Shivaji realised that war with the Mughal Empire would only cause damage to the empire and that his men would suffer heavy losses, he chose to make a treaty instead of leaving his men under the Mughals.

- Shivaji agreed to give up 23 of his forts, keeping 12 for himself, and pay compensation of 400,000 gold hun to the Mughals.

- Shivaji agreed to become a vassal of the Mughal empire, and to send his son Sambhaji, along with 5,000 horsemen, to fight for the Mughals in the Deccan as a mansabdar

**House Arrest in Agra and escape - May 12 1666**

In 1666, Aurangzeb summoned Shivaji to Agra, along with his nine-year-old son Sambhaji. Aurangzeb's plan was to send Shivaji to Kandahar, now in Afghanistan, to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier as Shivaji was now a mansabdar and working for Mughals.

Shivaji arrived in Agra with his eldest son, Shambhuji, and a small contingent of soldiers on May 12 1666, Aurangzeb’s 50th birthday.

Aurangzeb asked Shivaji to go to Afghanistan to consolidate the Mughal empire's northwestern frontier but Shivaji refused to do, Aurangzeb not happy with the decision of Shivaji decided to keep him in house arrest.Shivaji was allocated spacious quarters in one of the big houses and his personal servants stayed in the interior of the haveli. He was always under guard with at least 1,000 men on duty. Shivaji used his time to gather information. He befriended the postmaster and a few subordinates of the emperor and collected information about the happenings around the kingdom.

Shivaji held a ceremony honoring Pandit Kavindra Paramananda who had come to meet him. He also gave away his elephants and horses after announcing that he had decided to become a fakir. He then dressed up as a fakir. His close associate and trustee, Niraji Raoji, dressed as Shivaji and emerged from his house, mingled with the other pandits and then escaped from Agra.


**Peace with the Mughals**

After Shivaji's escape, hostilities with the Mughals ebbed, with Mughal sardar Jaswant Singh acting as intermediary between Shivaji and Aurangzeb for new peace proposals.
During the period between 1666 and 1668-

- Aurangzeb conferred the title of raja on Shivaji 

- Sambhaji was also restored as a Mughal mansabdar with 5,000 horses

- Shivaji at that time sent Sambhaji with general Prataprao Gujar to serve with the Mughal viceroy in Aurangabad, Prince Mu'azzam.

- Aurangzeb  permitted Shivaji to attack the decaying Adil Shahi; the weakened Sultan Ali Adil Shah II sued for peace and granted the rights of sardeshmukhi and chauthai to Shivaji.


Later on there were differences between mughal and marathas and they kept fighting , similar to how today we have political parties who decide to join hands after elections and sometimes fight with each other.

End of the day not everything is as black and white as it has been portrayed.

5198,"What Andhbhakti and Godi Media can do to someoneSo, a bit of context here. I'm 16, and My parents are regular BJP supporters and a regular watcher of Sudhir choudrey. I don't mind that. They voted for BJP in 2019 elections. Don't mind that either. Support CAA and basically everything BJP does. That kinda was a shock for me, so in December I sat down with them and had a casual chat, not trying to appear too political in front of them, as they don't like it.

Both my mom and dad said ""Beta hum to Andhbhakth Nahi Hain, but modiji Jo Kar rahe Hain desh ki bhalai ke liye hai, congress mein bahut scams hua tha to BJP chun liya""

Hmm. Typical Bhakt mentality. Didn't really mind that too, didn't expect much anyway.

From January onwards, I started doing some intense research and factchecking on everything that happened in politics since 2004. My views completely changed. I went from being apolitical to being genuinely worried about the future of our country.

In mid January, the Indian residents in Colombo (where I live) were having a CAA-NRC protest in the Indian Embassy. Two of my friends were going. But as soon as my parents figured out, they went crazyyy. I got grounded for a week, electronics confiscated, and was called an ""antinational, deshdrohi, anti-modi pappu supporter (tho I don't support congress )"" and so much more I can't even put in words possibly.

I let that happen. More things happened, i just let it happen. This was becoming commonplace now. Until today

I was just sitting on my desk, studying for mock exams, when my dad calls me. He asks me why dosent UAE, Saudi and other gulf countries take in rohingyas if they're so important to me apparently. He was arguing why rich middle Eastern countries, thousands of kilometres away from the refugees, take in those people if they really are so important. After completely countering his dumb logic, he snapped.

(Btw, my dad had always supported equality. Never seen him like this)

He got up and started shouting in my face about how Muslims are a plague and they were taking over the damn world. He said that Muslims don't migrate to Muslim countries, instead to other non Muslim countries coz there they will have 5-6 children and spread their relegion. Then, they take over the entire govt once their population gets high enough and collapse entire governments. He then started saying about exactly the things godi media says, about how Hindus are in EXTREME DANGER to Muslims and how India will turn into a fascist Muslim state if nothing is done, even if all stats point otherwise. As soon as I pointed it out, ironically I was hit with ""YE SAB FAKE NEWS HAI YOU ARE USING WAYY TOO MUCH INTERNET FOR A CHILD"". Ironically, I'd heard Sudhir choudrey say something similar to this, about how children spend too much time researching fake news on politics and the internet, not 3 weeks ago. After his Muslim rant was over, he shifted to Hindus.
 As ""proof"", he said all Muslims read Qur'an and pray in mosque, which according to him, even tho we are from uttar pradesh of all states, less than 1% of Hindus read holy books and go to temple and properly follow our relegion. He continued about Hindu supremacy, about how we should be superior. I'd never heard him talk that way. To try and calm things down, I tried to remind him I'm athiest. That was the end to it.

I got dragged by the ears, and got smashed on the head with a steel plate that was nearby. Got slapped and hit, didn't do anything. He said that he's going to disown me if I don't say I'm a pure Hindu in 5 seconds, which I out of no choice did, and that I will read 30 pages from Ramayana and bhagvad Gita everyday. He called me a terrorist, a failure, a shame on India and consequently locked me in the room and confiscated everything I had. Typing all this from grandmother's phone.

All the emotional weight aside, I feel like I've lost it. I've lost the freedom to speak. The freedom of speech. The right to have an opinion.

Everything I say, I get back a ""tum bachche ho, 18 Saal ke hokar Kuch Karna, tumhe Kuch samajh Nahi aata""

So much more things happened that I can't describe. I was hit so bad, and insulted to the face because I had a different opinion. I thought about it and realised all my dad did for past 3 years was watch zee news continuously from 7 pm to 10 pm. Nothing else.

5248,"Scammed out of 7k from an oyo scheme. What to do?I booked a hotel on OYO yesterday and got inside the reception at which the manager asked me to wait so I did. I was tired and sleepless from the flight and last night, hungry. As soon as I sat on the sofa, I received a call from someone at oyo telling me about payment method issues and how I can get 10% off by paying via Paytm. Okay but where to, how. I was skeptical of the call until the guy told me about the amount, business name, my phone numbers on the app, checked in-check out dates etc. Then he told me to wait and see the payment being done on my hotel booking, I did for 5 minutes and saw that the payment was done somehow. I received another call to send the amount to a Paytm number, biggest mistake I did it because of confusion and tiredness. And that the guy had my details, actually did something with the payment details on the app. I sent him the payment after which I checked in at the room. Okay, after eating something and getting back to life. I was confused why oyo would call me and that number didn't seem right. I checked back in the oyo app and it said the payment was done through a cheque (updated details). Now it ring a lot of bells and I was sure this was some sort of scam. (Fuck me for telling people to be aware and falling for something like this)

I clicked on the chat with oyo option. I had my chat immediately cut off after I asked about the thing due to ""technical issues"".
Another chat cancelled, called them to ask about it, stuck on transfering call to an executive for an hour, hanged up and called again. No information yet about anything. Nothing. This happened 5 times, then I got on chat again. Another weird topic to just cut off the chat.

I didn't bother then and just went to sleep. Whatever happened, I was ready to have lost the amount anyway. Now the hotel guy is having problems because he see the payment is done and what not but he didn't recieve anything. 

I am curious about how they got so many details, how someone hijacked my payment and why nobody at oyo is telling me anything other than generic bullshit of passing me to an executive which they don't even. Some excuses are lame. Their chat interface is awful, it hides the previous conversations and names, noticed it too late but I still have some screenshots I got somehow.

Link to whatever I could salvage without oyo app removing it: https://m.imgur.com/gallery/4irFDxK

Update on today: The company people called me to suck it up multiple times. It was from their in-app number, LOL. They told me that the payment would show up or I will get refunded without connecting me to an executive. I recieved calls from the other number with 4 different people telling me about it. 

Any help would be useful. Currently in Hyderabad. Told the cyberabad cyberpolice and wrote a complaint.

Sharing it on twitter and other places might be helpful too. 

I have a few audio recordings as well which I will share later.

1. Vegetable gravy and microwave rice 

Cut 2 onions, 2 tomatoes and a bit of gjnger and garlic. Mix them in a pan. Add either curry powder or cumin+coriander mix and haldi. Add some salt and oil. Mix well. Heat on a gas/Induction at Medium/800W for 5 min. Add in vegetables of your choice and some chili powder, water. Heat for 10 min on medium heat. While all this is getting ready, boil rice in the microwave (1 part rice, 2 part water, 10 minutes on medium). In 20 min you get a good gravy and rice. You can use frozen parathas too if you like. 

2. Bread+vegetable omelette

Bread omelette is a thing we eat for breakfast, but it can be a good healthy meal as well. Simply mix veggies like cabbage, carrot, corn and coriander into 3 beaten eggs. Add some chaat masala and salt. Fry in a pan and add 2 slices of bread while the egg is cooking. Heat on low heat (300W on induction) for 5 min. Cover the pan while heating. You get a decent omelette sandwich.

I watched The Lunchbox today and damn that is how movies should be, another example would be Gullyboy. These movies are so good, yeah they are about Romance but they are Oscar worthy. Luckily Gullyboy is one of the best movies with a celebrity cast. It hit both.

I have already spent some time time in programming but I want to learn under an experienced guidance and also, landing a job in India as a self-taught programmer seems a bit far-fetched. I have applied abroad(UK) and therefore I have an offer for MSc Computer Science. But, I don't have that much money and I cannot arrange a collateral for loan and anyway, I am hesitant in taking education loan as I am really not sure of what will be the outcome of my degree. So, I was thinking of bootcamp as an alternative. Now, I am not sure about the prospects of a boot camp in India. Will that be a good way to get a job. Is there even a good boot camp?

What I dont want:

* NOT interested in visiting places, no matter how famous, for the heck of it.
* NOT interested in going to some famous places just to get myself in photos
* NOT interested in the beauty of the landscape, whats the point if I'm there for just a day and merely envy those who live there?

What I'm interested:

* Visiting places where the pioneers in my fields of interest lived.

What inputs I need:

-I am going through biographies on Ramanujan and Turing and will be checking out the exact places they lived/worked. 

1) Who are the other great economists/scientists(Indian or otherwise) who have studied or spent time at Cambridge/Oxford. (I believe Erdos, Einstein, Feynman, Asimov would have been in UK for reasonable time)

2) I reach Cambridge at 8am and leave at 8pm. Thats way too much time. Is it possible to wind up Cambridge tour in 3-4 hours and make an Oxford trip the same day?

(I do intend to visit all 6 major cricket stadiums and do a 100 min run around each of them, completed two. Would like to visit areas where Gandhi went but no immediate plans yet for London. The Wimbledon tour is rather expensive, but I'd love to do that just because in 1999, Leander Paes won 8 matches(25 sets) in 3 days to win the Mens and Mixed doubles titles)

## Dharma and the Child of the Demon

It once happened that Krishna met a group of people, and each one came up to him and said what they saw as dharma. This happened at a certain moment in Krishna’s life, when he reached a certain point of frustration with the mission he had taken up. It was not a personal frustration. He was not a man who could be frustrated about himself or about something that concerns himself. The frustration was about the mission not being fulfilled. When he found that people were not standing up as they should, he asked: “What dharma do you want to stand by, all of you?” A rich man came, a skinflint who had done everything possible to acquire and amass money, and said, “I buy dharma from the learned Brahmins and God. I feed my family and worship at the temple. This is my dharma.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of greed. I know you not.” And he let him pass.

A man marked with emblems of sanctity came and said, “I am a pious person. I shrink from the ways of sin. Never did I kill or steal or commit any other sinful act. I have lived the righteous way. I am God-fearing.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of fear. I know you not.” And he let him pass.

A warrior approached Krishna and said, “I know my dharma. I have destroyed all my enemies and anybody who opposed me. I perform sacrifices to appease the gods, give charity to the poor, and proclaim my victory to the world. I feed the Brahmins and my praises are sung by them.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of vanity. I know you not.” And let him pass.

A meek-looking person came up to Krishna and said, “I am meek and resigned. I am humility personified. Unresisting I suffer cheerfully. I bear hunger, thirst, cold and even misfortune.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of a slave mind. You do not know the divine within you. I know you not.” And let him pass.

A sly-looking man came and he said to Krishna, “I stand away from risky actions, the dens of lions and I walk the path of safety, escape the wrath of God and by this, I know peace will come to me.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of cowardice. I know you not.” And he let him pass.

A very self-assured, arrogant looking man came up to Krishna and said, “To escape the snares of life, to repress the longings of flesh, I scorn human weakness in myself and others. In stern detachment, I avoid contact and I live apart, all by myself. I’m completely self-contained. I don’t need anybody or anything.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the dharma of arrogance. I know you not.” And let him pass.

A business man came and said, “I lend money to God by giving alms to the poor and I even keep a ledger of this so it can never be missed. I will attain through my dharma.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of commerce. I know you not.” And let him pass.

A saintly-looking man came up to Krishna and said, “Mine is the dharma of wisdom. I live by the words of saints. Not to resist evil, shall suffer in silence, shall inherit the kingdom of God.” Krishna said, “Your dharma is the child of inaction. I know you not.” And let him pass.

A man dressed in silks, with well-oiled, slick hair, came up and said, “Dharma is an illusion. I eat, I drink, I fornicate. My body is my only shrine. The pleasures of the flesh are my rituals of worship. There is nothing beyond this.” Krishna said, “You are a child of the demon. You will never be forgiven.” And he turned his back upon him.

What this is trying to say is, if one is dedicated only to his physical nature, there is no way for him. One may have various weaknesses of fear, greed, anger, anxiety, cowardice, vanity, and many other things, but if he is aspiring for something more than the physical, there is a way for him.  


 

Krishna spent a lifetime wanting to establish dharma. Many things went his way and to some extent, he did create what he wanted. Many things did not go the way he wanted, and people started interpreting and misinterpreting dharma according to their own ideas.

Krishna admitted, ""When it comes to my *swadharma*, I am 100% clear about how I should be within me.""

Many people brought this question up in Krishna’s life. When Draupadi was supposed to get married, Krishna did everything to see that she got married to the five Pandava brothers, and Draupadi questioned him, “Do you know what dharma is?” Or when Krishna told Bhima, “Leave Hastinapur to Duryodhana. Let’s build a new city,” Bhima said, “You are a traitor. I want to kill Duryodhana. You are telling me to leave this kingdom to him and go and build another kingdom somewhere else, from scratch? What do you know about dharma?” Similar questions came from Arjuna and many others. People questioned Krishna, “Do you really know what dharma is?” I will not go into the individual, detailed answers that he gave, but in general, Krishna admitted, “Even I do not know what dharma is in terms of action right now, because action is subject to situations. However we judge it, we could be slightly off the mark when it comes to the external situation. But when it comes to my *swadharma* (one’s own duty in life), I am 100% clear about how I should be within me.”

## Swadharma and Dharma

No intelligent human being is ever 100% clear about how to act; he always weighs it. Only a fool or a fanatic is 100% clear. Whatever we do, our very existence, our eating, living, and breathing here is an injustice to some other life form, if you look at it from their point of view. If you eat, you kill. If you breathe, you kill. If you walk, you kill. So if you don’t want to do all that and you kill yourself, still you kill. No action in the world is 100% right or 100% wrong. You just have to consider the larger good that you create with your actions and perform them accordingly.

Dharma is just about how you are within yourself. If you are in a state of all-inclusiveness, you will act according to your intelligence, according to the situation.

Dharma is just about how you are within yourself. If you are in a state of all-inclusiveness, you will act according to your intelligence, according to the situation. If you are not in a state of inclusion, if you are in a state of “you versus me,” everything that you do is wrong. You cannot do anything right because your very existence is wrong because you have made it “you versus me.”

Krishna’s whole life was a demonstration of just this: There was no “you and me,” it was “me and me” or “you and you.” Whether he was with the gopis, or he was acting as a statesman, or he was teaching the Gita, the message was always the same: of inclusion. Once there is only “me and me,” action is just a question of situation and judgment. No action can be 100% right or 100% wrong. But as Krishna always insisted, and as I have been insisting all the time about swadharma, you can have 100% clarity in how to be within yourself.",1582009153.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,3,0

Hi, I'm in my final year and I'm working on autonomous drones,  specialized for navigating in urban landscapes. Also, I'm using a  vision-only approach, no LiDAR, just a bunch of small cams. I'd like to  use this experience to build a self-driving car in India, mainly because  it seems like there's no focussed entity working on this in our country  and ours is a relatively untapped market, with a huge potential for  growth. We don't have enough road network in our country, so  self-driving cars won't be a thing in our country, even in say 25 years  from now and car ownership is at max 30M. Other forms of vehicles like  self-driving ""autos"" or some sort of a pick-up robotaxi vehicle will be  huge in our country. There's is a solid market for freight transport:  trucks, etc, which is another untapped market for autonomous vehicles.  Is this a frivolous pursuit in a country like India?

I am totally anti-Reliance and avoid using their products whenever I can. Of course, they are so ingrained into everything that it is impossible to avoid using their products sometimes, but I want to make a conscious effort not to. 

So, if Vodafone fails, and I don't want to use Jio, then what is the other option? Airtel? I used them for a while a few years ago and thought their service sucked and was so irritated that I cancelled my number with them (I had an extra number for work).

Account has been opened, and debit card is yet to be dispatched. 

Today, i was checking my messages and saw that my phone sent random characters (cipher text?) to some unknown number during the same time of the verification process with the iMobile App. I tried calling that number but wouldn't connect. Tried to check the number using TrueCaller and it belongs to some person and the number has been tagged as spam by more than 2000 people.

Am i safe? Is my bank account safe?

I am sure many of us are, were or will be in a situation where we have to take care of our aging parents, I believe am right now at this stage and i am looking for any suggestions to properly care for my parents as they enter into their old-age. 

Probably many of us are away from their parents and in some cases living in a different part of the world to earn a better living which makes this harder. I have been thinking about the best way to solve this but always end up with nothing viable. I have an uncle who has been thinking about this since many years and dint come up with any good solution for my grandparents, he always tells me to think about it soon. 

We do have relatives around in town and friends in the neighborhood who can be at a moments notice, but they are not actually in the house for any timely assistance. As generous as they are, its still a burden for them, whereas its my responsibility.  

The only solution i came up with was having a full time small family to work/stay in my parents house, but the trust factor is impossible to gain or be sure about. I keep digging many articles with horror stories were a help has done horrible things to the old, helpless people for either extra monetary gain or just because they can.

Any ideas or system, you guys have already in place is appreciated. Also, if it wasn't clear, my parents are in India, so i am looking for something specific to India.",1581956902.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,3

I need the exact name of this temple.

There's also a Kalachakra temple in the Namgyal Gompa.
I wonder if this means a temple that can't be photographed inside Namgyal Gompa.

5663,"Talking to Sanghis.This is a long rant, there's no point to it. You've been warned.

In my regular life, I like to think I am a rational/reasonable human being. I try to avoid conflict wherever possible, going so far as to err on the side of being a pushover. I do not mind, it saves me time I can otherwise spend doing things I'd rather be doing. 

When the BJP came to power in 2014, I remember feeling a slight sense of unease. I had just begun college and I was looking forward to finally having some sense of freedom I had not had access to previously. As the years went on, that sense of unease turned into a feeling of ""I-told-you-so"". However, I also knew that India has always had a majoritarian bent to it, and therefore I figured this was a passing phase, and that Indian society would surely figure out a way from going full-crazy, as full-crazy is something I hadn't seen my country go in the twenty odd years I've been alive.

The last couple of years, that feeling has slowly evolved into this weird waiting game, where I have found myself constantly waiting for the other shoe to drop. Slowly, some people started actually SAYING something. Protests happened. More people died. People actually started discussing Muslim lynching and those blatant, weird Islamophobic dog-whistles that the BJP used to call it's rabid followers to march. I figured if India hadn't torn itself apart in these many decades of being tested, it won't happen now. No matter how bad stuff's gotten. 

But now, I'm conflicted. Hope only lasts because, eventually, something *does* go right, and things *do* get corrected. Real life has no such guarantees. And talking to Sanghis is fucking making me lose hope.

They are EVERYWHERE. And that's what's making me lose it. Your auto wallah, who's soft spoken and sweet, until he begins his Islamophobic, Hindutva thumping rant. Your sweet, old uncle at the shop, who asks you if you've eaten well while simultaneously frowning and nodding along to Goswami shitting and blaming the said shit on Islam on live television. My uncle, who I've loved and adored all my life who also happens to be SUPREMELY sharp until he begins discussing how ""they should put all those dirty Muslims back in their place"". 

I saw an old policeman slap a (really) belligerent man on the street today. I hesitated in saying anything. I watched them for ten more minutes while the young man stopped himself from retaliating. I don't know why they were arguing, or why the policeman slapped him, but in my head I couldn't stand the thought of a public servant attacking a member of the public and go unpunished for it.

I knocked on the car window of the waiting police car. The other officer asked me what I wanted. I told him I didn't think he should've slapped him. I saw his face turn from shock to denial to anger as he realized I was challenging him. He asked me who I was and so I told him I was a lawyer. I think he realized I'd be worth more trouble than he was willing to take on tonight, so he asked me to leave. I left. I felt bad about it but I left. I left because I felt afraid of the Indian public and of the police. I felt too unsafe to speak out against the State. 

There's no point to this, because like many of you I too am trying to figure out how to best understand this country we live in today. So please help. Do we fix this? How?",1581973183.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,43,96

First time posting here. I know that most of the content here is very much regarding political and economic challenges so I apologize if my question comes as frivolous in the midst of other high magnitude things.

I wanted to ask if anyone has seen the 2005 Indian movie “The Blue Umbrella”. There is an opening scene where the children of the village appear to be parading as part of some sort of children’s festival or holiday where the adult villagers act reluctant but in reality are rather entertained and give them money. The kids also had a sort of demon / creature looking torso on a stick which made me think that it may have been part of some tradition.

Is this a specific cultural holiday / event? If so, to what state of India / specific Indian sub-culture. If this is not a specific thing, but the writers imagination, are there any similar holidays it could have been based out of?

Thank you",1581946639.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,6

I'm a student in a college. The issue was - really pathetic , unhygienic food given to students(with insects found in it).

We have a college WhatsApp group with all the lecturers and principal in it, and when I posted some pics of the food, many students &  friends  joined me and completely agreed.

I wrote (in a way, threatened) that I will go to the state's student committee and other such similar committee and raise the issue there ...maybe also do a strike/protest if nothing happens.

But something similar happened last year, when my friend did exact same thing(posting pics of such food in the group) but no student joined him. And at the end of the day he got a call from the principal to meet him, and the princi told him that its wrong to gather people. And he can be debarred from the college, University and exams.

To start with, I.. basically know nothing about courses. I'm lost when it comes to hearing terms like B.A or B.SC and lose my shit because I know literally nothing about these bachelor's degrees. Of course, I'm aiming for DU. But their courses have me confused. I don't know which course I should choose.

As far as my interests go, I love history and archaeology. But obviously, that isn't gonna bring much money to the table. Of course, my parents are very supportive, and didn't force me to take any stream, but rather encouraged my choices.  As for my best subject, I guess its likely English. Not that I score good, but naturally great. I mean hell, for instance, I accidentally studied Maths for my English paper and came out with 99. So I think my skill and interest wise, archaeology and journalism or writing are good for me. But again, they won't bring much money or respect into the household.

But, I suppose I'll go into Business. But I don't know which one. I really needed the experience of randian's on this one. To put it simply, which job in business firm's (commerce wise) would give me both a decent pay and decent amount of free hours? For example, I've heard C.A. or Investment Bankers make a fuck load of money, but don't have much free time. I'm avoiding that. Even after this, the second question for me would be, what are all these degrees and which one helps me out with what area in my career, like B.SC or B.A or Eco Hons?

We were applying for a Visa to India. My family has been countless times. We were applying through the CKGS website because we were unable to obtain an eVisa (I assume due to my father's previous nationality of being from Pakistan).

The site is asking for proof of renunciation from Pakistan. This was back in the 80s and he's not sure where his renunciation certificate might be, or if he ever got one. He solely has citizenship of the United States right now. He can provide US Citizenship documentation where renounces citizenship to any other country. But, it doesn't explicitly state Pakistan. Would this be sufficient? Or does he need a document asserting explicitly that he is no longer a citizen of Pakistan.

5750,"How to fight against DND violators every day?My phone number is DND registered in all categories. But I seem to receive spam text every day. I am registered with Vodafone.

I have tried reporting them to Vodafone/TRAI by sending an SMS text to 1909 with the spam text content. After that, I will receive a message that's going to be processed. Then someone from customer service calls me in the morning to tell they have received it and will solve the issue. And after a few days, I receive another message that's been solved.

But it's never solved. Because I still keep receiving spam texts from same company again and again. So far the process is pretty much harassment (because of additional calls from customer service rather than any solution whatsoever).

How do you fight it? Btw are there some apps that can let you block sender id by wild card. i.e. ""**FRECHGR""?

Few of the spammers I can think of (Note many of them didn't even stop even after I contacted the company customer service and ask them to stop)

1) [Freecharge](https://www.freecharge.in/)

2) [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/) - Special mention because of their genius customer service executive flat-out told me that didn't send me spam even though the text is about their product and has a link to their website.

3) [Vodafone](https://www.vodafone.in/) - They send me the same message about some plan they are changing that I don't use for 15 days in a row.

4) [Vodafone Play](https://www.vodafoneplay.in/)

5) [GoIbibo](http://goibibo.com/)

6) [Oyo] (https://www.oyorooms.com/)

7) [HDFC Bank](https://www.hdfcbank.com/)

8) [Income Tax Department](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/)

9) [Aha Taxi](https://www.ahataxis.com/)

10) [EaseMyTrip](https://www.easemytrip.com/)

11) [PhonePe](https://www.phonepe.com/)

These are some of them I remember at this moment. There are many more of them too.

https://preview.redd.it/2za3mmqqbfh41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7ad4f61cbaf55a003992857455d489617a663a

## Tl;dr

IFF has been tracking various facial recognition technology (FRT) projects in different stages of development all over India. In the first part of this three part series on FRT, we have mapped major FRT projects in different states and broadly classified them into two categories according to intended purpose: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## The Government needs to calm down!

In 2015, [**Jacky Alcine**](https://twitter.com/jackyalcine/status/615329515909156865) was surprised to find an auto-generated album in his Google Photos folder which contained a photo of his African-American friends categorized as “Gorillas.” This categorization had been done by the facial recognition software that Google Photos used to automatically sort any photos uploaded by the user. After Jacky posted this image on Twitter, the resultant outrage was immediate and understandable and Google promptly removed the offending categorization.

In order to understand why this error occurred and why many civil liberties organizations are calling for a ban or a moratorium on FRT, we need to understand how machine learning occurs and how bias in the samples used will lead to bias in the recognition done by the software. However, even before understanding these important questions and trying to come up with workable solutions and standards, the Central Government and different State Governments have already started deploying FRT for two major purposes: Security/Surveillance and Authentication of Identity.

## Facial Recognition for Security/Surveillance

One of the biggest causes of alarm currently is the [**Request For Proposals (RFP)**](http://ncrb.gov.in/TENDERS/AFRS/RFP_NAFRS.pdf) issued by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The RFP invites bids for the creation of a National Automated Facial Recognition System (AFRS) which would be used to create a national database of photographs which would help in swiftly identifying criminals by gathering existing data from various other databases like Passport, CCTNS , ICJS and Prisons, WCD Ministry's KhoyaPaya, NAFIS or any other image database available with police/other entity.

While this national level project is still in nascent stages, police departments of various states are already in possession of FRT developed by public and/or private developers such as:

We have already sent a notice to the Delhi Police over their illegal use of FRT during the recent protests in Delhi ([**Read about it here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)). In Telangana as well, there have been multiple instances where police officers have been illegally asking individuals to submit their biometrics.

Simultaneously, the Ministry of Railways has announced its own facial recognition based security/surveillance system called [**Internet Protocol (IP) based Video Surveillance System (VSS)**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=197330) to be provided by RailTel under the Nirbhaya Fund. The South Western Railway started implementing the first phase of this project, and it has stated [**in a press release**](https://swr.indianrailways.gov.in/view_detail.jsp?lang=0&dcd=3370&id=0,4,268) that it has been successful in developing a suitable facial recognition system which has 100% success rate in acquisition and matching of faces.

## Facial Recognition for Authentication of Identity

[**In a press release**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=183958), the Ministry of Civil Aviation announced the Digi Yatra Programme which primarily aims to increase the ease and efficiency with which passengers at airports are processed from the moment they step into the airport till they board their flight by making the whole process paperless and using the biometrics (face) of the passenger as their boarding pass. The Government has already started rolling out Digi Yatra on a trial basis in different airports like [**Hyderabad**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/hyderabad-airport-launches-face-recognition-system-for-entry-on-pilot-basis-1562059587608.html) (July 2018), [**Delhi**](https://www.medianama.com/2019/12/223-face-recognition-digiyatra/) (September 2018) and [**Bengaluru**](https://scroll.in/article/929851/facial-recognition-as-airports-in-india-start-using-the-technology-how-will-it-be-regulated) (December 2018).

Recently, the [**Telangana State Election Commission**](https://tsec.gov.in/pdf/ULBS_MPLTS/circulars/2020/Cir_No_111_TSEC-ULBs_2020_dated_18.01.2020_1401.pdf) also came up with a similar idea to counter impersonation in polls. TSEC with the help of the Telangana State Technology Services tested FRT in 10 polling stations in Kompally Municipality of Medchal Malkajgiri district by using the technology to verify the identity of voters by comparing the photographs taken at the polling station with photographs of the voters in the TSEC database.

FRTs are increasingly being used by educational institutions to verify the presence of teachers and students. The [**Gujarat Government**](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-gujarat-new-system-of-teachers-attendance-through-face-recognition-5975585/) has introduced a FRT system with a geo-tagging feature which ensures that primary school teachers themselves are present in schools and they are not being replaced by unauthorized and unqualified “proxy” teachers. Elsewhere in Tamil Nadu, the Government Higher Secondary School in Triplicane has installed a camera which is equipped with FRT in order to mark attendance of students. Similarly, IIT Delhi also has a FRT enabled attendance app in place which is called Timble.

The most recent use of FRT for authentication of identity that we came across is proposed use of the technology by the Maharashtra Government in order to record who avails its Shiv Bhojan Scheme. Shiv Bhojan is a scheme aimed for impoverished sections of society, wherein in select locations around Mumbai, the Government will serve thalis of food at a nominal rate of Rs.10.

## Fighting Back against FRT

FRT projects are becoming dangerously popular in India with various national level projects (AFRS, DigiYatra and IP VSS) underway. However, all these projects have been implemented without any legislative framework governing their operation. Be that as it may, the most worrisome part is not just the implementation of a faulty FRT system but also the implementation of an accurate system which could become a tool of mass surveillance. These problems will be discussed in the next part of this series.

To counter this grave threat to the privacy of all Indians, IFF has taken various steps. We have sent legal notices to NCRB and Delhi Police against use of FRT without any statutory basis or procedural safeguards. We have also filed Right to Information requests in conjunction to every such instance of FRT that we have come across. We will keep you updated as and when we receive responses to our RTI requests.

Personally, I admire different people for different attributes. Here is a very short list. 

1. Perseverance and commitment: Arvind Kejriwal. He is the only political hope in India and the way he quit his IRS career and to become an activist and later a politician is very inspiring. 

2. Scientific thinking and humility: Abhijeet Banerjee and Esther Dufflo. I worked for JPAL South Asia as an intern and they genuinely do great work in applying scientific principles to social and environmental problems. Most people in the office were very humble. The entire team is inspiring. 

3. Personal conduct and social contribution: Narayana Murthy and Sudha Murthy. They are amongst the richest people in India, but they epitomise good family values. Their kids are all high achievers and have forged their own path. They do not need to build a $1 billion house overlooking slums to feel successful. Instead, they created the infosys prize which awards the best scientists doing impactful research.

Before I put my question forward, I thank anyone who's taking out the time to read this and respond. Thank you so much.

We are a very small (team of 2), very early stage startup, based in Nagpur.
We were doing market research via survey and going out to talk to people to see if the demand even exists, and found out the hard way that it's very hard to get even 5 people to like something, so the question is : 

how to get people interested in your idea and how to get them to respond enough so that they care about giving honest responses?

So in a way, this may be more about me taking issue with absolute nothings than it being an actual problem. From what I have experienced, everything I want to watch, I cannot even watch around them.


My mom is a typical stay at home mom, always at home and all that. Trying to watch TV with them always consists of me finding interesting titles and not being able to watch them because I know I will be constantly asked to ""fast forward"" or else hear comments of some sorts. That defeats the purpose of watching shows. Then when my mom finds something interesting, I need to say ""You won't enjoy it."" ""not for you"". She wanted to watch ""We're the Millers"" last week, and I had to convince her that she wouldn't like it.


Yesterday, she wanted to watch a Vir Das set, I have never watched his shows, so I said ""okay"". Five minutes away and she is offended by a masturbation joke. I got annoyed and said ""I told you Stand Up isn't meant for you"".



Watching TV with them is really such a fucking chore. As a teen I couldn't watch WWE, TBBT or even the Simpsons. It fucking sucked. I don't know if anyone can relate.

6030,"Conflicted about course choice. Psychology, or continuing BBA.Edit(25/2): I'm dropping out of BBA hon. and going to do psychology! ^^^^^^^^^

Hi, 
I never had much of an idea about what I needed to do, and quite conformatively enrolled in a BBA Honors course despite my growing interest in Psychology and lack of interest in business.
Over the months, I continue to have doubts. The first year in college is about to end, and I'm faced with a choice of whether to continue this course or start over with psychology. I have been overthinking a lot of things.
I am unable to see myself content after completing the BBA Honors+MBA. The subjects that our college teach us in this course mainly include management, economics, and accounting; neither of which interest me in the slightest. When I think about the career ladder, restrictions of a job, etc- I feel stressed. 
Psychology, however, interests me a lot. I like to understand behaviour, disorders, conflicts. Studying psychology will, I'm certain, be an excellent experience for me throughout. End goal, presumably, being a clinical psychologist. The advances in this field, the research; I want to be able to observe it all closely. Additionally, being able to help people for a living sounds like something I so want to get into.
Now there's the issue. The earning. The base earning of a psychologist in India is plain terrible. While going down the business stream, it might be a struggle, something I'm not interested in, but it poses a much higher chance for financial stability. This is based on my impression of the information I have gathered, I might be wrong. 
I dont think I'm a materialistic person, but money is necessary for comfortable living. My understanding of such is minimal. 
I would appreciate people's opinions regarding what I could do at this point. 
I'm currently in Bangalore, studying in Christ University. Being a reputed university for Psy., I considered applying here itself for Bsc. Psychology. Except that the long timings, rigid dress code, small campus size, hierarchy etc have been disappointing in my 1yrs experience and I would like to avoid it. NIMHANS seems like an excellent option but it doesn't seem to be having undergraduate courses. My understanding for doing clinical psychology is a Bsc/Ba+Msc. I did not take science in 11+12 so I cant be doing a medical degree far as I know or I would consider that as well. I'm also wondering if I could complete my BBA Hon. UG and then move onto Msc. Psy. PG and still be able to be a clinical psychologist.
I'm open to any suggestions. Whether I should stick to BBA hon. and take the safe route or switch to Psych and enjoy what I do despite risks. And if I should indeed go for Psych, what options should I consider? I have looked into a lot of options, but just how do I know if it's the one I want? I'm conflicted... ahem. Pls help. Just a small suggestion would help too.",1581881447.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,12

6064,"Killing Freedom of Speech?This is not something that will make headlines right now, but will definitely affect the future.  

[**400 million social media users set to lose anonymity in India.**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-12/400-million-social-media-users-set-to-lose-anonymity-in-india)  

Now the question is if they lose anonymity, and they are against the government, how will it even be safe for them to post dissent? As we know the current government is famous for sending goons, mob lynching, and hate speeches, this will just make it easy for them to pick out targets and shut them off completely.  

Recently, there are many other “provisions” that have been put forward by the government (such as the formation of [DCCC](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) ). 

If the government starts censoring the internet, it will be a very tough time for the normal individual to get an unbiased news source. Everything that doesn’t agree with the government will be censored.  

>	In an open letter to India’s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, executives from Mozilla Corp., GitHub Inc. and Cloudflare Inc. said the guidelines could lead to “automated censorship” and “increase surveillance.“ In order to be able to trace the originator of content, platforms would basically be required to surveil their users, undermine encryption, and harm the fundamental right to privacy of Indian users, they said.  

It will be a direct attack to RTI. People won’t be able to know the real news and would be heavily influenced by the censored media that would (obviously) take the side of the government.

Apart from the lack of entertainment, 'chaddi humour' (See the 'stars of bollywood' sing songs about chaddi), Injustice to several deserving candidates (Teri Mitti snubbed), but most importantly, the most horrible about the show, as it is still being telecasted right now, is the silent political agenda that is being carried in the show. 
 Note that many notable stars who are regular part of the show each year are missing. Some of the names being Shah Rukh Khan, Deepika Padukone, Salman Khan, The Bachchan's and even the top winner of the night Gully Boy director Zoya Akhtar was absent for the program. Any links among the names? SRK, Salman and Bachchan's never seem to answer anything political. Deepika, we all know what happened a month ago. Zoya Akhtar has been actively protesting CAA-NRC. 
 I don't know if this is true or not (please verify if you can) but I read somewhere that BJP paid nearly 28 crores to TIMES Media to make the event happen in Guwahati, Assam where the political atmosphere has been quite tense in the past times. If you're watching the programme, then you might have noticed how everyone who comes up on the stage has been praising Assam and how wonderful everything is there. Once or twice was okay, but say that a lot of times, you know something's wrong. Also, URI not winning any major award might well be to hide the fact that the awards are not biased towards movies portraying Nationalism. The National Film Awards have been criticised for that.
Anyway, this is how I feel. I can be wrong as well. Would love to hear what you guys think.

6148,"Seeking help/advice/thoughts/motivation; moving over a loss and trying to overcome the messed up thoughts in my head.Dear /r/India, first post here and it had to be gloomy. Feel free to remove if it doesn't adhere to the rules or if it doesn't belong here.

Just when I (22 M) was living my happy-go-lucky life, I was set aback by an event that occurred roughly a year and a half ago which completely turned the tide. I recieved the news of my friend's passing and was left desolated. We have been friends right from school and have been close ever since. The umpteen cups of tea and smokes were never kept count of as we had no clue that the journey would be cut short. Read on to understand my plight.

One cursed dark morning, I recieve the shocking news of his passing. Moments like these are what life has never prepared you for. I chose to believe that I was being pranked until I was given the assurance that the news is true and was forced to swallow the pill. He had tragically lost his life in a road accident. Fast forward the mournful events that followed, I was left in a state of shock/depression/loneliness for the next 8-12 months. 
Earlier in my life, I had dealt with the passing of my pet dog and managed to overcome the loss and move on in life. But, I couldn't deal with the fact that my friend who would proudly announce each and every passing event of his life, decided to leave without saying a single word of goodbye and would never speak of it ever again. The fact that things ended abruptly left a huge void that can never be filled by the most convincing of answers.


This brought about a lot of changes in my life. Our usual weekly meet-ups was just me sulking at home, my reasons to visit his house were to stand by his parents who lost their only child. There was always a constant thought about the event that would linger in my head and never let go. I would break even on the brightest of days and weep into the longest hours of the night. Although I gradually came to terms with the loss, I just couldn't settle to believe that something of such extent had happened so suddenly.


This is where my problem arises, the event impacted my life to unbelievable extents. I turned into an over emotional guy and would overthink the most silliest of things. I would often cry at emotional, tragic scenes in movies and further make it worse by listening to some sad songs on loop. The questions about life and death would constantly flash in my mind with every passing moment. 


Now, this is where I seek help. The human brain being the ultimate supercomputer capable of producing extraordinary thoughts and innovations, mine seems to be broken as it often brings up unpleasant and dark thoughts. I live in a very-similar-to-joint-family setup with at most 25 people I really care about/would catch a grenade/would take a bullet for. With the events that have occurred in my life and the the huge list of friends and family I care about, I frequently think about situations similar to whatever had happened in the past and lose my mind over it. The fear of losing someone so close, has struck me very hard and is forcing me to distance myself from others to avoid any sort of heartbreak in the future. The unpredictability in one's life and the changes that can happen unannounced and at any instant have given me sleepless nights. 
This has caused a lot of distress and has become a pattern everytime I go to bed or at random moments during the day. 


Any thoughts, solutions, words of wisdom, love and peace will be accepted. Thank you.

Since there is nothing to lose, should someone appear for all three of them or only the one they have studied for (B.Tech in my case). Also, are B.Arch and B.Planning going to be different and harder than B.Tech? Is there something worth mentioning about them? Are they even worth it?

It's really confusing and I feel lost. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I have a plethora of questions but this isn't the right post for that so more of that later. I did try approaching ""agencies"" but they tried selling me stuff in the end.

6169,"A little insight into Parasite and South Korea's entertainment mediumParasite undoubtedly deserved this year's oscar for best picture. As an asian and an avid k-pop, k-drama and korean movie fan I was really proud that it had become the first foreign language film to win an oscar for the best picture.

  


If you don't understand why Parasite is being considered a masterpiece, watch a few of these videos which provide a bit of insight into the film's superiority in every department. Mind you it's just the tip of an iceberg. You need more than 20 minutes to decode every detail from this movie. Bong made poetry with this movie.

https://youtu.be/ma1rD2OP85c

  


https://youtu.be/ezwSfT7sXO0

  


https://youtu.be/ci-gFovSJf0

  


Pushing Parasite aside, I have always loved Bong's work. The Host captivated me as a child while Okja, Snowpiercer, Mother, Memories of a Murder were pure joy as I travelled deep into cinema. He loves making movies and it shows.

  


Other Korean movies I love include

  


TheHandmaiden, Oldboy (turned into Zinda), I Saw the Devil (turned into Ek Villian), The Man from Nowhere (turned into Rocky Handsome), Il Mare, My Sassy Girl (turned into Ugly Aur Pagli), Always (turned into Do Lafzoon ki Kahani) etc. You will be surprised to see how many Korean movies got remade by Bollywood with little success.

  


Now, K-dramas or Korean TV. It is one of the most cheesiest form of drama ever. Most K-dramas follow a standard formula with a prominent romance track spanning mostly hour long episodes of 16 or 20 in number. There's usually no second season and you will LOVE them if you like emotional stuff. Their writing is very sophisticated, a bit cliche but highly effective and emotional. You just connect to them every single time. I have never cried so much over any other form of media. They are very conservative. The best they could do is kiss while Korean movies get to do the 'devil's tango' in broad daylight. I would say their production value is on par with movies.

  


Finally, K-pop. The trending music genre filling up Spotify discover playlsists. Most people only heard the word K-pop due to BTS. But, K-pop has a lot of wonderful music aside BTS. Groups like TWICE, BLACKPINK, EXO, Stray Kids, Mamamoo, LOONA etc. and soloists like IU, Chung Ha, Sunmi, Hwasa etc. constantly make catchy music and are rapidly gaining international fame. Again they are very conservative. Boys and girls never interact and you can almost never see someone flaunting their cleavage. Some really good music spanning almost all genres.

  


South Korean films were always good, way before Parasite made headlines. K-dramas are really popular worldwide especially in the South West Asia. K-pop is undoubtedly a major music genre of its own. All with a population of mere 5.5 crores. Quality over quantity.

  


All things said and done, as Bong said in his accepting speech, ""If you can cross the one inch barrier of subtitles, you will be open to a whole new world of cinema"".",1581881212.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,9,27

And people all over were given the choice to move to either country. That means those people actually had a choice. But these people also made the decision for their children. 
So, shouldn't these children after they have matured have the right to switch countries? 
Shouldn't there have been an agreement wherein people should have an option to apply for citizenship to either country and the country has to take you in (unless there was some security concern)? 
Otherwise those who didn't make a conscious choice to stay in that particular are forced to stay there.

It is environment friendly too. The app has been around for some time, but I just stumbled across it. It's called quickride, and no, I am in no way associated with it. 

It made me wonder about all the apps and businesses that don't get enough attention and support. 

What are some of the apps that you think people should know about? What does it do? Does it solve a problem in society?

Please don't recommend any dating apps.

I don't like being an NRI. I don't like staying away from home. I don't like being able to meet my parents only once a year. I don't like video-calling my friends when they get married.

Last night, I had a dream. 

I dreamed that I was born in an India that was similar to where I live now. I could visit my parents as often as I wanted. My friends were a 15 minute walk away. We all lived together, but in a country that was objectively so much better than my own country in real life.

Then I woke up.  It made me feel a little sad. I know I don't do anything for my country. There are so many things I would love to do. I would love to teach little children and participate in elections. 

Growing up in a middle class family teaches you to only fend for yourself. What is going to come of teaching young kids? My job lets me enjoy myself as much as I want. Do I really want to give it all up?

 I would love to live in the country I dreamed of. But I don't do anything about it.

I'm trying for pursuing an MBA and to fund it i plan to get a edu loan. I can at max spend 25lk for MBA.

I've got an admit in XLRI 1 yr pgdm(GMP) program but caught in a delima if I should go for this course or try for IIMs, ISB or even for international MBA. As per my research, it is an okayish course but not the premier one(even for the college). Avg ROI and salaries are again decent.
International MBA depend on scholarship as I will not be able to afford the hefty cost.

I think it is a decent course but not a prestigious one and I would need to do another MBA after 7-8 years to grow further.
I know this is a dumb thing to ask, but what would you advice me to do.


tldr; got an admit for 1yr MBA from XLRI. Can afford the course(take loan for half the fee) but it is not the prestigious course that can match the highest level. International MBA too costly without scholarship.
Need suggestions.

6336,"The possible impact of the trump visit. American farm products will flood India.If you have been to any country which has a lot of industrialised agriculture, you'd have seen the sheer variety of American products. Chickens without skin and bones cost less than 200 a KG. In India, that would easily be above 300. 
Milk in tetra packs is easily about Rs 40 a liter. Many are cheaper. Indian milk, which is not in tetra pack, costs more. American almonds and nuts have already stormed our supermarkets, and we are one of the largest consumers now. 

If you recall the WTO meet withdrawal by India a few months ago, it was because of the protests by the farmers. American producers want to invade the Indian market, and given the price to quality ratio, they will be very successful. It will be like the Chinese invasion of the smartphone market. Xiaomi grew to over 50% market share in less than 3 years. 

The problem is, what happens to the millions of small farmers and poultry growers? What becomes of the dairy industry? 

I am no expert, but this visit by trump seems like a push for opening up India  markets to the American food companies. It is possible that like a lot of things, the government will do it slowly and without explanation. Maybe 5 years down the line we will feel the effects.",1581833257.0,,Politics,dark,25,32

Some people fought for equality, independence, against discrimination and treating everyone equal and yet here we are, it's 2020 and we are still living like it's 1960s or something.

I get it, the bill is good for other religions except Islam. It's a good thing to give them permanent citizenship but why did you omit only one religion? I mean surely there would have been any other solution. You take so much money as this and that tax and this is the solution that you come up with? Discrimination and detention centers?

This is not my India and I don't want it to be this way and honestly the concept of countries is a bit wierd to me. Nobody own this land or that land or the planet Earth. Everyone should be allowed to go and live where ever they want as long as they are not harming anyone in any possible way. Maybe if we stop thinking ourselves as countries and flexing each other with who has got the bigger pee-pee (obviously nuclear weapons) and start thinking as a whole planet then we'll be able to fight anything that would be thrown at us (viruses, natural disasters, alien invasions etc).

Maybe it just sounds good and won't work practically but we can try. This is what we are good at, solving problems. We picked up tools and conquered the whole planet for f sake, we can solve this one too.

Anyways be good and love each other guys. Don't discriminate, don't be rascists. I am proud of you guys. A lot of people here are against the bill. Remember we are all equal and beneath our skin we are all just muscles (fat in my case) and bones made from star dust.",1581796474.0,,CAA-NRC,dark,4,13

The work here is repetitive, with an outdated technology stack and that's why I have been planning to leave it. But I am confused whether to switch the job or do post graduation?

Some background - I graduated from a private college with a BTech degree with average marks. I had some interest in coding since school days that's why I opted for Computer Science. But in the past few months I have come to realize the work I am doing right now is menial and I don't have the skills required to get a job in a good tech company. I have been trying to study to improve them. But without any set target or deadline, I have just wasted the time procrastinating. Also a couple of failed job interviews has made me to think to stop planning about switching and do something else. Like post graduation. GATE and CAT are the only options I have been thinking about because I don't want to study abroad. I have been more inclined towards CAT because syllabus of GATE is vast and since I feel I am good in Logical and Verbal problem solving, given a 8-9 month preparation period I might crack the CAT exam with good percentile. But then I am not sure whether I should leave the tech side for good and switch to management instead.

Please give me some advise about what I should do now. Also please share if anything else comes to your mind that can work for me.",1581778529.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,9

6522,"Zomato Gold is a waste of moneyI currently have both Swiggy Super and Zomato Gold subscriptions since I order a lot of food and eat out. While my experience with Swiggy support and service has really been nothing short of super, no pun intended; Zomato, on the other hand, does not respect its customers at all.   


* When it launched a couple of years ago, it still had a decent catalog of restaurants but now it's just declined over time and only places that are mostly empty even in prime hours are the ones that offer Zomato Gold. 
* I've ordered from the same place from Swiggy only with the delivery free paid facility and the general coupon code, and it costed basically the same, if not slightly cheaper than using a 1+1 on Zomato Gold. Why would a person pay Rs. 1800 extra for a service which ends up making food cost the same using price hikes and Rs. 40+ delivery charges to compensate for it. 
* But the above pointers are not what drove me to do this post. It's the lack of support from Zomato and disregard for customer satisfaction completely. I went out to eat with a couple friends a few weeks back, and due to my mobile phone going low on power, I logged in my Zomato onto a friend's phone. That done and done, I later wanted to sign out of all devices because that is something any basic service should allow you to do. I looked all around the app and the website and nothing. So I contacted the support. They asked me to email them that as the app team couldn't help in this. A simple log out of all devices. 
* The email conversation went back and forth for days as I explained the situation to them and they asked me to ""change my password"". Now, the thing is, that Zomato accounts don't have a password. You get an OTP on the email. It is astounding that they didn't even know this, and they're the senior team I was asked to get in touch with LMAO. 
* I was asked to wait 4-5 days in the email as the technical team looked into it. At this point, I was just into this to see how challenging it is for an app/service-based company to give a simple log out facility to their customers. And well, by the end they asked me to ""please log out of your device yourself"". Literally. See, I could have asked my friend to log out of his device any time but that's not the issue. The issue is the lack of user agency in the core design. And the inability to cater to simple account requirements even at a special request. 

So bad offers. Bad interface. Bad customer support. What did I do pay for? Nothing. What did it cost?",1581780072.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,33,71

6642,"Need advice for restarting as an undergrad after a long mental illness slumpTl;Dr at bottom. So basically in 2013 I was in Kota preparing for NEET. I developed Schizophrenia while in XI grade because of so much parental pressure and was already under depression. Parents disparaged me even more and took me to temples and taantriks to cure me before I finally got medical help after long time.  

I have recovered for most part since 2019 but I was forced to give HSc / XII exams without any study. I opened most books night before the exam and that was pretty futile as well because both Schizophrenia and depression destroy your memory as well as concentration.  Same thing happened with the two more improvement exams.


I suggested idea of failing the exams by forfeiting but parents got enraged that this would destroy their reputation in our town. Mom even forced me to cheat by writing formulas on my eraser so dad wouldn't have to be so ashamed of my percentages at least, according to her. 

If I had failed I could give it almost as many times as I wanted but unfortunately I passed the exam every time. My last and best percentage were 66.65% with PCB and fisheries. Psychiatrist suggested I really shouldn't go into medicine as its a very stressful career. 

I would really appreciate any advice about career fields or undergrad courses I could apply to. I am 21 currently.


I have been looking at some way to study XII level maths for engineering but its very hard with rigid Indian education system. I have always loved maths and sciences and the only option I found so far is to update my scores with NIOS but its eligibility and status is hazy. 

I am also open to studying abroad at community college or foundation course for a year or two to update my qualifications in maths.


**Tl;dr** -  Been at home since 2015/16 and looking at a way to get into fields which need XII maths. I won't mind considering other career options either.",1581744721.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,31

6668,"Most Hindus are ritualistic in nature and lack any understanding of the religionBeing a Hindu myself, this post is based on my observation of our society. The hinduism I see around me is mostly about rituals, festivals and following age old customs. People hardly know about logic behind the practices they are following. Many have havans and prayers at home but hardly understand anything as they are mostly in Sanskrit.

There's nothing wrong with this but what I don't like is the fact that there is very little knowledge and understanding of the philosophical aspect of the religion (Which I feel is the core part of it). I've read a bit about it and was surprised seeing the various schools of thoughts that existed at that time including Samkhya, Vaisheshika, Charavaka and Yoga. As I've reached a phase in my life where I see many dilemmas playing out, trying to understand Bhagvad Gita made me realise the amount of wisdom lying there. We should be proud of such a work being done so many years ago as it's supposed to be an integral part of our faith.

Also, I feel a good understanding of religion will help people differentiate between Hinduism and Hindutva ( I feel lack of understanding of difference between the two also comes from ignorance). Also, it will lead to a more objective analysis of religion as a way of life which had its flaws but also made massive contributions to the world. I don't like how it becomes very binary like with some people calling it 'the most tolerant and beautiful religion ever' while some banishing it by only focusing on caste system (Infact a good understanding of Hinduism will also make people realise that current practices of caste is absolutely not called for).

So I feel Hindus should try to know more about their religion and it's philosophies. That will be helping in several ways for the future. It will also help us discard the bad parts of it like the Manusmriti which I feel should be given up.",1581700292.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,48,72

6675,"How my school “promoted” women safety.There was this workshop in my “co-educational” school. Irony, there were only girls in the workshop. 
 
So the workshop (was not given any particular topic) was about women safety (kind of). All the girls from standard 9^th to 12^th gathered in the school auditorium with the teachers.  
Plot Twist:  
The workshop was not about women safety/empowerment but how the girls should realise that this is the way the society is and guys will always look at you in that lewd way. Horrendous thing were spoken: 

-	Girls should only wear nude coloured bras because black/any other coloured bras would attract boy’s attention. 
-	They shouldn’t EVER talk to periods to their male counterparts, or never show any hints of it. 
-	They should avoid guys in general. (I find this one really funny because come on...)
-	The teacher implied that guys will look at you in a lewd way because they’re boys and you cannot do anything about it. 
-	Girls should not wear short dresses and should only wear clothes that revealed the least amount of their skin. 
-	Girls were forced to wear slips so that the bras aren’t visible. These fuckers made the shirt nearly translucent and expected them to wear a slip. Come on. 

Instead of empowering girls, these assholes said that they should suppress everything. Some of my friends felt so threatened that they were on the verge of crying. 
The boys should be taught to respect girls. Instead they did this. **Shameful**.  

I think at this rate, if the school teaches shit like this, girls would never be able to increase their voices about harassment. I was utterly shell-shocked after hearing this. And all this was coming from a teacher. A person who is supposed to teach values, is speaking this!

6703,"The results of India's small UBI experiment are stunning. It would be fairly inexpensive to implement basic income nationwide. Why aren't we pushing Congress and BJP to make this happen?The results speak for themselves...
 https://socialprotection-humanrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Indias-Basic-Income-Experiment-PP21.pdf 

School attendence, childhood mortality, household debt, productivity, malnutrition all improved dramatically, while alcohol consumption declined! after instituting a basic income of just $4.40 cents per month to every adult in the village and $2.20 to every child.

India spends a record low 2% of it's GDP on it's public social security endeavors. It could implement basic income at this level nationwide by spending another 2% of it's GDP to do so. And doing so would significantly boost India's GDP easily earning back this money and then some.

Why aren't Congress and BJP both running on basic income, and why aren't we pushing Indian politicians to do just that? 

With other schemes, politicians can easily pocket some of the money without anyone noticing. But Basic Income is much harder to steal. Every single person would know what they are due to receive and the media would cover it if people are not being given the money that they are due. So the money would actually go to the people that need it the most.


There are several excellent reasons why UBI is superior to targeted means tested programs that only go to small groups of people...

https://youtu.be/kl39KHS07Xc

UBI will be globally adopted at some point. I want India to lead the world on this and advance the UBI cause by several decades in the process.

DESTINY “DELHIED” DERAILED

Ah, the ever so stabbed in the back  
India’s ‘Tryst with Destiny’  
In charlatans’ words prized  
Yet left to sour in brains puny.

Clear, all so ominously clear  
All over again folks’ fall from  
Self-realization’s grace  
Opening their door to self-damnation  
Disgrace as many a time before  
World’s sole Ved lighthouse-  
The Krishna brights!  
That fell to savages’ darkly blights  
All of a millennium of servitude  
To world’s worst barbarians  
All but honour derobed  
Yet lo! It emerged the victor  
In into freedom afresh  
On natural progression’s account  
As well Indian peoples’ irrepressible  
Sanatan Dharam fount.

Alas! Again misled  
Up the garden path  
Only this time in lead  
The native ‘brutes’  
In sheepskins the wolves  
Mother-India’s ill-breeds  
Ill-educated, barbarians, savages,  
into untiring misdeeds  
the cabals, ooh!  
The Jahliat’s cahoots.

Now is the die cast  
Recast, still more Anti-History  
In the making  
Those nightmares in offing  
Peoples’ self-laceration-beatings taking.

Lo!  
Behold!  
Traitors’ ‘trots’  
Truculent the mushrooming lots  
Gangsters ganging up  
At raping the Mother-India maid  
Such the time’s ill-bearings  
Well, yes, in Kaliyug modes made  
On and on, madness in method too  
Such the quislings’ unrestrained ado  
Where we, patriots, take hits  
Yet keeping brave, as stubborn  
Such of Indian genius born  
For, to save is from extinction  
A long-misled Vedic nation  
No time to cry, nor whine  
Nor yet lament  
For, again, there is  
So much India Redeeming work to do.

But they don’t even know!  
They don’t know how I still plow  
Alone, under indifference’s stark  
Burning sun, all thirsted, all starved  
Just like the Indian Kisan  
The India Redeeming’s furrow upon furrow  
Untired, unwilled to suffer defeat  
However searing the hard fallow grounds' heat.

Folks!  
We are civilization’s revivals bound  
To raise all over again  
Upon Indian subcontinent  
The Sanatan Dharam banner high  
That is too the time’s cry!

Look around everywhere on earth  
No one in the know  
How is, well, now the next go  
No one  
None!

But we know  
Thanks to Sanatan Dharam  
We know how is the go!

Hindu Rashtar  
Vedic Civilization  
Restitute!  
Reconstitute India  
It’s a subcontinent  
A mighty power peg on earth  
With Vedic light alight  
Humankind's sole promise bright.

Haul from dusts  
The books, folks!  
Study hard at Vivekanand  
Shine forth upon life  
The Vedant light  
Redeem India!  
Restore the Vedic order  
That is too, s'il vous plait  
Time's tall order.

To Hindu Rashtar!  
Off to Hindu Rashtar!  
That’s the time’s call  
These raging downs  
No problem, enemy is weak  
No match, in mind a screech merely  
If we still are humankind’s melody  
The same of ancient vintage  
The Jagatguru pedigree  
Only no taking pity this time  
Slash the enemy head  
Slay the enemy  
Make that our living's new paradigm.

Be the Hanumans, you folks!  
Standing at sea  
Still at sea  
To find out is anew  
Our lost Nation-Sita

Jamwant is around  
No worry  
Just keep your end  
Be Hanumans!

Then watch out  
Enemies scatter as straw  
In our battles’ storms  
However hard the times  
We are still alive

And also one month's rent as maintenance fee when we're leaving the house.

All of this on the top of an already insane amount of rent.

I understand demand and supply in big cities as there will always be people who will pay more. But even for the people who will pay more, the rent makes up for pretty much half their salary and often times even more than that.

People earning anything less than 40k a month are having to live in PGs to have any sort of savings as the cost of living is very high. And trust me when I say that PGs are not the best place to come back to  after a long day of work to earn peanuts at the end of the month.

# I Was With Kanhaiya Kumar When His Car Was Attacked

For the eighth time in two weeks, Kanhaiya Kumar's convoy was targeted today as he drove through central Bihar's Buxar, part of his journey across Bihar to galvanize support against the controversial new citizenship law.

The 33-year-old, who belongs to the Left, was travelling in an SUV which was accompanied by five cars filled with supporters and a police escort when he spotted a group of people, faces covered and stones in hand, standing by the national highway that leads  to the town of Arrah, 75 km from the state capital of Patna. I was sitting next to him when he asked the driver to pull to a stop.

I told him to relax, and said with the police escort present, we were all safe. But he was concerned and got out of his car to reason with the crowd. By then, 10 of Kanhaiya Kumar's supporters from his home town of Begusarai who are travelling with him on his tour gathered, armed with sticks. The other side provoked the violence that erupted. Stones  were hurled for nearly ten minutes.

Kanhaiya Kumar, who ran unsuccessfully for parliament last year, was immediately pushed into a  car by a policeman. Habib, my cameraperson, managed to get some footage before ducking into another vehicle. The ten policemen present seemed largely clueless despite the fact that just a few days ago, stones were flung at Kanhaiya Kumar's car, shattering the windshield.

The air rattled with the incendiary cries of *""Desh ke gaddaron ko, goli maaro saalon ko""*,  a chant now associated with supporters of the government who feel opponents of the Citizenship Amendment Act or CAA, cleared by parliament in December, are anti-nationals.

The police did not use batons to rein in the crowd that was targeting Kanhaiya Kumar - some of them had removed their belts by now.

The convoy was able to pull away.  ""It's a fight between Godse supporters and Gandhi supporters...so where's the question of stopping the *yatra*?"" he told me in the SUV. 45 minutes later, Kanhaiya Kumar appeared on stage at Arrah.

6732,"Questions on fiscal prudence that we should all be asking our central government.Please add on as you deem fit. Immediately below are those that seem necessary to me.

1) Real Fiscal Deficit Numbers: The fiscal deficit number and target shared in the budget presentation did not take into account independent lending by govt orgs such as,

Food Corporation of India: Has been borrowing for the last 3 years. Has not been paid by the govt during this time. While FCI has released some figures, what is the total amount it has borrowed?

Same with orgs such as NABARD, PFC, Fertilizer corp, and so many other that we don't even know about.

2) Real financial state of orgs like LIC, National Small Savings Fund: These are the orgs that fund the loans of the govt as well as Food Corp, Fertilizer Corp etc.

What do their respective balance sheets truly look like? How much money did LIC really lend to banks and NBFIs over the years, that is now considered NPA? 

3) RBI related questions:

As the RBI had increased SLR (CRR for that matter) requirements for commercial banks, and policy dictated that (public) banks store that money in govt securities; can the govt tell us how much this total amount is? And why it forces banks to behave this way?

And more broadly, does the govt understand that forcing banks to park their money this way, and simultaneously crowding out private lending by taking such huge loans from govt orgs and banks; is an important part of why successive RBI interest cuts have no meaningful impact in reducing commercial rate for lending?

4) Another RBI question: The RBI continues to build up its forex reserves. (approx $471 Billion as of last week); even though multiple experts (including some RBI folk) have said that beyond a point, trying to use reserves to stem a money outflow will be futile. Many have said that around 450 billion is already beyond sufficient in our current situation.

And, not allowing for natural adjustment/strengthening of the Rupee right now may lead to risky situations if the global outlook does turn negative. Rupee continues to be a Last Money In, First Money Out segment for more foreign investors, and is the govt prepared to risk a SE Asia-like currency crises, just so that the RBI has more reserves, a part of which the govt can quietly gobble up?",1581696913.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,0,4

Can any marketing professionals or people who know about the field in India help me out with my questions please (in the description).I prefer asking real people over googling.1) How hard do you think it will be to get a job in marketing? I'm going for a BBA and doing a crash course in digital marketing. Also I know Photoshop and website design (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). I also know a bit of programming and I'm learning French. I've also volunteered a lot so my resume isn't completely empty.
2) Do all marketing jobs require travel? I don't mind traveling for like once a month for a week but is it going to be too hectic like more than 10 days every month?
3) Will my gender be an issue? I'm a girl.
4) Optional question - What is the salary range? Do entry level jobs pay at least around 20k a month hopefully....?  What are the prospects for growth 10 years down the line?

But Prakash Javadekar's statement about BJP losing Delhi because of Congress's failure made me think about it. May it is true that BJP will not be able to survive without the Congress as its opponent. They've been unable to fight any regional party on home turf quite consistently. If we had more regional parties would it be so difficult to imagine an India without BJP or Congress? 

How would national coalitions be made? North vs South? Hindi vs non Hindi? I have no idea. But the possibility excites me. What do you think?

6857,"How I see the Pulwama Attacks, AbridgedSo an year ago, there was some intelligence input that there was a possibility of a terrorist attack. Naturally, they relayed the information over to our honourable Prime Minister the Great Narendra Modi. Now our beautiful Modi was so preoccupied with thinking out policies for the then Budget to boost our economy that he did not pay attention to it. Those stupid intelligence officers should have found a better time to inform our marvellous Modi, like, say, after February 14th.

Anyways, the CRPF men were planning to go to Srinagar from Jammu. Our fantastic Modi told them to take 78 vehicles so that the people would not miss the glory that is the Indian Army. Some fools raised possible security threat in going in a conspicuous 78 vehicle convoy. How dare they?! Shouldn't the people of India, especially those antinationalistic Kashmiris, see the glory of our Hindu nation?

Anyways, while they were moving, a car laden with explosives rammed into one of the vehicles, and the resulting blast killed 40 of our brave CRPF men. This act of terrorism irked our magnificient Modi, who meditated to let their souls rest in peace. During this meditation, Modi got a divine message. ""Those putrid Pakistanis committed this act. We must punish them."" Now this was divine, because even after a year, the NIA still has no clue where the bomb came from, while Modi understood it in a fraction of a second.

Anyways, our divine Modi swore revenge on the damned Pakistanis, and sent our brave Indian Army to Balakot to kill them. Our Indian Army dropped bombs there, killing several Pakistani terrorists. This was a very valiant move. I heard that a soldier was so brave that he gained the Vir Chakra for bravely getting his plane shot down and getting caught.

Anyways, the attack was a success. Exactly 420 terrorists died, including 256 antinational bacteria, 69 anti-Hindu fungi, 42 anti-Indian ferns, 31 anti-democratic trees, 13 Congress lizards, and 9 Muslim Crows. The satellite image in this [Reuters article](https://in.reuters.com/article/uk-india-kashmir-pakistan-airstrike-insi/satellite-images-show-madrasa-buildings-still-standing-at-scene-of-indian-bombing-idINKCN1QN02Z) should show all casualities. If you don't see all of them, including the bacteria, that means you're antinational. Get wrecked by NRC, you filthy Non-Bhakt.

Anyways, the intelligent people of India realised that our excellent Modi should rule India for decades to come. They saw that under our admirable Modi, we can regain the glory of our Vedic age, where there were satellites, where people used the internet, where people had nuke-laden arrows, where divine cows cure cancer, where women were trophies to be placed rightfully in kitchens, where we were proud of our caste system, where Dalits knew their place, where there were no Muslims and hence no terrorists, where kingship was hereditary; wait no, kingship can't be hereditary otherwise we'd be no different from those crazy Congressmen and even crazier Congresswomen, to say nothing of Congress-transgenders. So the Vedic age wasn't perfect, after all. Huh. You learn new things every day.

Anyways, this is my belief of what really happened in Pulwama. Hindustan zindabad.

6861,"The 5 step-game of NPR+NRC+CAANRP - NRC -CAA is the same thing, Don't be confused by all these names, This is just to confuse the common man.

# First Step - CENSUS [aka NPR]

Some govt. officials will visit your place and will ask you the following questions

1. Your name
2. Your Date of Birth
3. Your parent's name and place of birth
4. Some sort of paper just to confirm your identity, ""NOTHING RELATED TO YOUR CITIZENSHIP"" such as maybe your Aadhar number, Voter ID card.

# Second Step - The D factor [Doubtful Citizen]

After a few months, all the data from NPR will be collected and some Government officials will check the whole list and if you weren't able to answer a few questions such as - Your Parent's exact age, their DoB, your own Aadhar number just because it's been month you applied and haven't received it or any other reason not mentioned here then that official will simply put a ""D"" in front of your name i.e. Doubtful Citizen.

# Third Step - NRC

If your name is in the new filtered list of Doubtful Citizens then you will have to ""Prove your Citizenship""

How?

The government has not published any such guidelines as per now but we can understand from the example of Assam: Aadhar Card, Name in the Voter list, name in Ration card list can nothing prove your Citizenship, It was also said by Amit Shah repeatedly in his speeches and interviews recently.

Source: [https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/](https://www.siasat.com/aadhaar-voter-id-passport-not-proof-citizenship-govt-1769667/) \[The link also has a video interview, Just in case if you like watching his face and listening to his voice, otherwise believe me and read further\]

You will have to present documents which should prove where you were born 30 years ago if you were not born then you will have to show the documents of your parents or grandparents, any property documents maybe. If you are able to provide the proofs then you are safe, If not then you will be filtered out once again, Hence the 4th step.

# Fourth Step - Foreigners Tribunal

This will be your last chance to prove that you are Citizen of  Bangladesh, Pakistan or Afghanistan, If you are Muslim then you stand no chance because CAA will be activated here even if you prove that you were a citizen of any of the above countries. If others are not able to prove their Citizenship then they will also be labeled as Foreigners.

# Fifth Step - Detention Centers [JAIL FOR FOREIGNERS]

6 detention centers are already functioning in Assam, Constructions of detention Centers has already begun in other states.

**~~\[NSFW\]~~**  I typed a long paragraph about the life in the Detention Center but then  I realized that you guys like Truth but do not the BRUTAL HONESTY. So let's skip that part.

# How to stop this 5-step plan?

It's VERY SIMPLE, As soon the government begins with the first step we need to boycott it immediately because once people are filtered out then it will be too easy for the government to handle us because then they have to handle only a few of use and they exactly know which one of us.

You are not alone, ""We the people of India"" is a group formed by more than 120 organizations throughout the country has given a call to boycott the NPR \[Press release attached at the end\]

How to boycott this process:

If officials visit your place then don't be angry on them, They are not Sanghi (some of them might be), They are the government officials who will be doing this government survey, Offer them water, tea, ask them to even have a seat if you would like that but just politely tell them that you won't be sharing any details with them as it is unconstitutional, Don't give any papers, Don't share any information with them verbally. They will try to tell you that it's a Government survey and it's unconstitutional but take a stand and deny the information politely.

Now I know very well that a lot of my fellow Hindu brothers and ~~sisters~~ females might be thinking that I will give them the papers because mom-dad will yell at me but yeah I will stand against this CAA and NPR during protests, I will go to Shaheen Bagh, No way. It won't work that way, The government will start picking up people one by one after that because just for an example If 1000 people are living in a locality then 770 might show papers then they have to handle only 30 people now, They very well know how to handle 30 people.

I am leaving a video in the comments sections, The same concept explained in Hindi by Yogendra Yadav, share that video with your Driver, Servant, Vegetable Vendor or anyone you know might not have the papers despite caring about their religion. It might change someone's perspective.

https://preview.redd.it/u78c91rqqvg41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=f129985762fc3a71684d2c90830c94b9ba750065

### Tl;dr

Our commitment to our #SaveTheInternet campaign remains steadfast. IFF responded to TRAI’s ongoing public consultation on net neutrality enforcement. We have provided recommendations to ensure India has meaningful net neutrality which goes beyond mere reference within legal systems. Our response addresses the need to remove scope for discretion, increase transparency and accountability, boost the local measurement ecosystem, and build better more-inclusive institutions.

### Background

As we have [**previously written**](https://internetfreedom.in/trai-consultation-on-net-neutrality/), the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is in the midst of a public consultation on net neutrality enforcement. The issue is of course very close to our hearts, since it was the rallying cry which brought together more than a million Indian internet users under the SaveTheInternet.in campaign. It is their collective voices which helped steer telecom authorities in recognising the principles of an open, fair and equitable internet. The principle is meant to help ensure that your internet provider cannot dictate your experience online. You can read about the historicity of the issue [**here**](https://savetheinternet.in/blog/guess-whos-back-back-again-savetheinternet/).

The net neutrality principle (which was formalised in July 2018), prohibits your internet provider from discriminating (economically or technically) between different types of internet traffic/applications. Economic disrimination is reasonably easy to detect and is explicitly regulated through the *Prohibition of Discriminatory Tariffs for Data Services Regulations, 2016*. However, without an actual enforcement regime we noticed that technical discrimination was going ahead unimpeded. As a result we [**brought back**](https://savetheinternet.in/why-this-again/) the SaveTheInternet.in campaign and petitioned authorities like TRAI to work towards developing an enforcement framework to internet providers accountable.

Well, yesterday i.e. 13th February, 2020 was the last day for initial comments to TRAI on issues relating to enforcement. The consultation relates to both technical standards on how to identify disproportionate or discriminatory traffic management; and the composition of a multistakeholder institution which will work with Government in framing standards and requirements to uphold the net neutrality principle.

### Our Top Concerns and Recommendations:

We have emailed our recommendations to TRAI and IFF’s primary focus is ensuring that the actual implementation of the framework remains individual and user centric. Our aim is to ensure that the framework does not drift towards a scenario where your internet provider has undue influence on the actual enforcement. The primary risks which could arise due to an ineffective framework include:

* Regulations which offer internet providers a pass and they **do not have to publish enough information (in terms of quality and quantity)**.
* **Vague regulations** which offer your provider with enough **discretion to discriminate** between different types of services on an arbitrary basis. Think of a scenario wherein your gaming streams, P2P file sharing applications or encrypted traffic is performing worse because your internet provider has made some decision behind closed doors.
* Prolonged “**wait and watch approach**” could be used as a veil which prevents any enforcement mechanism in the interim.
* A dearth appropriate **traffic measurement systems**
* Finally, if a **multistakeholder body**, which is meant to be representative of the entire public, and will advise authorities on enforcement is **cornered by your internet provider and large internet businesses**.

Our recommendations have addressed these issues head-on and provided substantive recommendations to mitigate each of these risks, among other issues. However, there is more to be done and we must remain vigilant.

### Next steps and how can you participate!

The consultation remains open and the next stage is the Counter Comments phase. **February 27, 2020** is the last day by when the public can submit counter comments to TRAI.

For this stage, we encourage you to read our submission and please feel free to shoot us an email on **policy@internetfreedom.in** if you feel we may have missed something or if you wish to provide any inputs. Due to the technical nature of the consultation we would be especially keen on inputs from technical experts, network engineers and other concerned citizens.

**You could Sign the “Take Action” Petition:** While such enforcement frameworks are being devised and will take time, there exist clear breaches of net neutrality in the form of illegal website blocking by ISPs. This is the clearest form of existing violations of binding license regulations. Join more than 3000 people who have signed on and are asking for immediate action and remedy at [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://internetfreedom.in/trai-consultation-on-net-neutrality/savetheinternet.in) in the meanwhile. You can support this campaign by signing on!

Ladies and Gentlemen, This was the Gujrat sold by H'ouble Prime Minister to everyone. The government has no plans to think about the welfare of these localities as many of them are Dalits & It's totally against the RSS ideology, They won't even eat at a Dalit's home. I can give you a list of books if you are even slightly skeptical about this thing. 

It's a fact that India's Media is spineless, Trump may very well agree with this plan of building the wall (Of course), but it's a good time to unmask this cruel act on the international stage.

It will take barely 10-15 seconds. Tag every major International Media house on twitter with a relevant source or any image (great cartoons done by India Artists) to get their attention and let them do their job.

But everyone is familiar with the 'Delhi Model'. Who wouldn't want it in their city? 
We say AAP just won as a glorified Municipal Corporation. So why can't AAP simply focus on City/Town Level elections? If it forms the Corporations in various cities, it would surely be great for the cities. And in general for the people. 
If we and they know that they would be good in that setting, I think it would be great if they focus on this approach.

7001,"The new code on labor is more an ""employer exploitation manual"" than a labor codeAn analysis on how it promotes exploitation:

A. The most glaring instance of the government’s failure to support labour standards is the Ministry of Labour’s proposal to fix the national minimum floor wage at ₹178, without any defined criteria or method of estimation.

B. This could lead to a dangerous race to the bottom by individual States, in a bid to attract capital and investments. This is rightly being called ‘starvation wage’, especially given that the Ministry’s own committee recommended ₹375 as the minimum. 

C. Another concerning issue is that the four codes exclude over 95% of the workforce employed in informal units and small enterprises, who in fact are in greater need of legal safeguards

D. There is no clarity on who constitutes an ‘employer’, an ‘employee’ or an ‘enterprise’, giving the owner greater discretion to interpret the provisions while making it more difficult for the worker to draw any benefits from them.

E. The code on wages legitimises and promotes further contractualisation of labour, instead of abolishing it, by insulating the principal employer from liabilities and accountability in the case of irregularities on the part of the contractors.

F. it is proposed that ‘apprentices’ be no longer considered employees, at a time when evidence indicates that apprentices are made to do jobs of contractual as well as permanent employees. 

G. And if all this were not enough, the wage code also brings back the draconian provision of “recoverable advances”, a system that the Supreme Court clearly linked to coercive and bonded labour, wherein distressed and vulnerable migrant labourers could be bonded to work through advance payments. This is akin to modern forms of slavery, also encountered in rural labour markets.

H. Similarly, the eight-hour workday shift has been done away with, and multiple provisions of increased overtime have been inserted. The code also gives ample alibis to employers to evade bonus payments.

I. seeking justice against unfair practices of employers has become even more difficult now as non-payment of wages will now not be a criminal offence and penalties in case of non-compliance have been reduced. The government wants to provide a “facilitative” rather than a regulatory and punitive environment for the owners, with “facilitators-cum-inspectors” replacing the “inspectors” who used to ensure implementation of various labour laws to aid employees.

J. The code even has a provision on “employees below fifteen years of age”, which can be construed as legalisation of *child labour*.",1581673288.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,22,66

7026,"In Need of HelpDear r/Indians, I hope that all of you are in a state of good health and well-being.

This might be a bit embarrassing for me to post but please, try your best in helping me out with this ""issue"" that I have.

I've been noticing that I'm having a very hard time in trying to get up early. Sure, it must be that I have a habit of sleeping a bit late and thus, wake up late. Makes sense, right?

Except, even when I go to bed early and even when I absolutely crash out and end up in a state of deep sleep that people might think that I've died (really wishing that I die while on my sleep, but be careful for what you wish for, as they say), I still have trouble waking up early around 7-8 am.

This wasn't the case back when I was in college, as back then, even when I went to sleep late or slept like for one or two hours, I somehow managed to get up on time, at around 6-6:30 am.

Post graduation and the following one and a half years, I kinda forgot that ""art"" I suppose, of getting up on time.

Now, as I'm working on a small start-up for the past 2 months, this issue is proving to be a bit of a pain for me, to manage and handle. I mean, it's a good thing that the timing is flexible and there is not a fixed timing where I need to show up and leave but still, it's kinda bothering me that I couldn't get up early as how I used to.

It's one thing to have not woken up early at all in one's life and struggle with it as a result but, it's entirely another level of annoyance and bummer to ""forget"" such a practice after having been accustomed to it prior, in one's life.

And thus, almost the entire day gets ruined and spoilt for me, as I become all sultry and grumpy in the realization that I have overslept. Not a very good way for one to have their day started, I suppose.

What could be the cause for this odd behaviour of mine, that others might perceive of me being simply lazy? I've heard that depression makes it very hard for people to get up early and I suspect that I've been suffering from it for almost 5-6 years now, so, is that the case?

Or is it something else deeper, something with which I'm not satisfied with and thus, it's my body's (and my subconscious mind's) way of trying to resist and avoid it?

Is it a sense of hopelessness and nihilism that whatever I'm doing, does not matter since as of now, I'm just doing something for the sake of attaining financial independence and not something that has always been my passion and desire? Sure, I honestly like whatever job I'm doing right now, but still.....

I'm sorry for a long post about something that may not even be an issue at all. People might think this as being a ""silly, petty"" reason from my part if I tell to them except, it's not.

I just wanted to confess and share here and hope it wasn't a bad read.",1581663215.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,15

7045,"The Muslim Rashtriya Manch (RSS affiliated) in it's book Yoga & Islam says that ""Namaaz is one sort of Yoga asana"". Although they are not much influential, this agenda / propaganda is far more dangerous.In 2015 the MRM published a book titled 'Yoga & Islam' to promote Yoga's 'Universal Appeal'. This book was released by the Union AYUSH Ministry thus stamping it with Government Approval. This attempt to make Muslims do things associated with Hindus, making statements like 'All Muslims should recognize that their ancestors were Hindus' etc. is far graver concern.   
This is an example of cultural / minority destruction by assimilation. If this succeeds the Minority officially becomes a part of the Majority and then is treated differently with the Majority community. This effectively snatches the 'Minority' card away from them and the Majority's culture can be freely imposed on them without any accusation of being Anti-Minority.   


Taking the same Yoga case, the right approach should have simply involved propagation of Yoga as simply a form of Exercise, and it's health benefit. Instead it was propagated from a Hindu narrative and then made to seem that 'Namaz is one sort of Yoga Asana'.

A similar example to this in India would be the Advent of Sikhism, due to the values of Sikhism (lack of cast system) several lower caste Hindu communities joined Sikhism, but this lead to creation of a caste system within Sikhs. \[Might be a poor example.\]

7082,"A Revolution for the Ahmadiyyas in IndiaSo today I learnt a little more about the sub castes (and sub-sub castes) of the Islamic faith and I think we need an all-out protest, as a Secular nation, to force the Sunni-dominated *All India Muslim Personal Law Board* (AIMPLB) to give equal rights, opportunity, recognition and respect to the sub-caste/faiths of Islam.

Ahmadiyyas are persecuted by Shias and Sunnis world wide and not recognized as Muslims but are in India - except by the AIMPLB. This is outrageous and a mockery of our constitution. It may be a private institution but should abide by the law of the land. The AIMPLB also look down on the Shia community of India and deny them higher position in the community and organisation.

> This is an organisation of Sunni fundamentalists which does not take into its fold Shia and Ahmadiyya Muslims. Its duty is to protect Muslim personal laws which are based on Sharia. It supports the antediluvian system of triple talaq, child marriage, and opposes gay rights. It objects to any change in the divorce laws to confer parity to Muslim women. This board issues fatwas against reforms in Islam and all kinds of progressive ideas. The misogynistic law board should be abolished for the sake of Muslims. Muslims need no other laws but modern civil laws based on equality and justice.

During the time of the Church of the East, it was said that there was an influx or migration of East Syriac people/Chaldeans/Assyrians into Kerala, whom eventually mixed in with the native Nasrani/Syrian-Christians of Kerala. Does anyone have any information about this? Granted this theory has been contested before, but many Syrian Christians in Kerala have had their genome tested and noted that their ancestors have had some admixture of Middle Eastern/Levantine/maybe Jewish DNA alongside significant Indian DNA. The Knanaya vehemently claim that they descended from a pure Syriac-Jewish community that came in AD 345 to Kerala by Thomas of Kana, or Knay Thoma. This too is hotly contested but DNA evidence does suggest some validity to the Middle Eastern theory.

7172,"Doubt and some questions regarding Article 370I am writing to this seek clarifications on some of my doubts regarding the abrogation of article 370. Before delving to the issue, I want to state that I consider myself as a social democrat and had  ambivalent stance regarding 370 before it was revoked by the central government. 
I know that one of the major reasons everyone oppose the move in this sub is due to the subsequent crackdown on civil liberties by the govt. As pointed by several opposition leaders like Shashi Tharoor, the govt didn't took the confidence of the Kashmiris in this matter. Moreover, the dissolution of J&K assembly prior to the abrogation (  to circumvent all the processes)  also seems to be very undemocratic. I am also aware of the double standards of the govt as they are comfortable with article 371. 
       
But my question is, in a  strictly theoretical sense, do you think article 370 should be a temporary provision which eventually needed to be revoked ?  and the  assimilation of J&K into India was important?

Some months ago, I read an interesting opinion about this on Quora ( by Arun Mohan) . He said that India doesn't have strong federalism and should try to somewhat emulate the American model . He believed that like J&K, every state should have special provisions and most of the states should have more power.  Ministries like Defense, Foreign affairs  and communications etc  should be under the central govt while rest of them should be a state matter. Each state can even have their own tax policies.

7275,"Thoughts about the typical Indian mindset from an NCC cadetI was a recent NCC cadet in college. There is a camp every year where students are supposed to stay like soldiers. We were excited initially. 
Then we saw the reality.


They made us sleep on the grass over newspapers. 


They were supposed to provide biotoilets, instead they asked us to dig pits for the toilets  on a field where there were snakes. 
We did not get blankets though it was 5-6 degrees. 


We were not allowed to complain about anything- be it the inadequate food, horrible hygiene and lack of protection against snakes. 


Meanwhile, the commanding officers (2 of them) lived in a separate 5 star tent with daily supplies of booze (we saw the jawans carrying it). The Jawans were not much better off than us, though they had a folding bed and blankets. 

The commanding officer sent the jawans to fetch fresh fish from a nearby market for his CAT. A full truck of jawans went daily in the evening to deliver fish to the officer's house. 

A lot of us were dissatisfied and vowed to complain when the camp ended. 

The COs knew this. What did they do? HIRE A DJ AND GIVE SOME CHICKEN ON THE LAST DAY OF THE CAMP. And then go around taking feedback while everyone around me was dancing. I was shocked. Most people were saying all ij well because party karne di. The entire corruption was forgotten. Just one DJ and some chicken is enough to make us ignore the actual issues. 

To this day, the camps continue to happen the same way. Rampant corruption and absolute abuse of power. I went to a Jawan and told him that we really need to shower. He said jab rape hona hi hain to enjoy kar lo, complaint mat karo. 

TLDR: Corruption in the army is visible even in the NCC. And people will forget their suffering of 10 days if they get to dance with a DJ for 10 minutes. Indian politicians exploit this emotional susceptibility.",1581571456.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,47,214

It was supposed to be funny. But all I asked him was did get out and pick up that trash? He looked at me like I was crazy.

Later I confronted him and he can't even recognize the fact he just littered. Or if he did how does it even matter?

Is littering a non-issue even amongst educated medium and upper class Indians in tier 1 or tier 2 cities?

7388,"Did Man Enter Kerala Temple to Kill Priest? NO, FAKE ALERT!#  CLAIM

A  video showing a man wearing slippers and entering a temple is circulating on social media with the claim that he is a Muslim who entered the Kerala temple to kill the priest.

“When he was stopped from doing so, he started throwing the ‘*aarti’*  and attempted to vandalize idols because the priest was singing chants and ringing bells. Muslims were telling the priest not to do so,” the claim adds.

In the video, people can be heard saying, “Amit Shah ki Jai. Please take off your slippers. Sir, please take off your slippers! Your slippers!,” as the man continues to walk inside.

# TRUE OR FALSE?

The claim along with the video is misleading. Firstly, the video is not from Kerala but Kolar in Karnataka.

Secondly, Kolar SP Karthik Reddy told **The Quint**  that the man seen in the video has been identified as Sikandar Beg and  is “mentally unstable.” He denied that Sikandar had entered the temple to kill the priest.

7393,"An open letter to Justice A.P. Shah on the online video self-regulatory codeTL; DR:

Last week the the Internet and  Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. This code industry wide code is signed by just 4 online video streaming providers and is intended to apply to the entire sector. It will require self-censorship practices which are there in the Television sector to be implemented for online video streaming services such as Arre, Amazon Prime, MX Player and Netflix. The code also creates a private body called the Digital Content Complaint  Council (DCCC) to judge complaints and impose penalties. As per [**press reports**](https://www.livemint.com/industry/media/hotstar-voot-others-sign-up-to-form-complaints-council-for-ott-platforms-11580907470733.html) it will be headed by Justice A.P. Shah who is a steadfast defenders of civil liberties and democratic values. With a view to place the several concerns of institutionalized self-censorship and chilling effects, we wrote him an open letter yesterday.

## In detail

In the past [**we have repeatedly warned**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) of the dangers of a dangerous self-censorship system for online video services that is being championed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (""IAMAI""). This system is called the, ""Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers"" and we have [**in detail explained how this will cause tremendous damage**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) to artistic creativity, user choice and innovation in the video streaming sector. This essentially institutionalises a dangerous TV style self-censorship system that will have a chilling effect on the diversity of content and programming.

This ""Self Regulatory"" code also creates a judicial body with what is called as a, ""Tier 2"" for adjudicating any complaints on the content of the shows which are aired on online video streaming services. This body is called the Digital Content Complaint Council (""DCCC"") and when the intial complaints to the signatories of this code (which are online streaming companies) are not settled, it hears them as a judicial case. It also will determine complaints sent by government departments and also can take suo-motu action. Such powers are generally modeled from the Broadcast Content Complaint Council (""BCCC"") that is a body for television broadcasters in India. The results of such practices in the TV sector are for everyone to see (*or, due to censorship not see*).

As per [**media reports**](https://internetfreedom.in/online-video-streaming-and-tv-are-not-the-same-so-why-is-the-iamai-trying-to-make-it-so/) the first Chairperson of the DCCC is the distinguished jurist and the retired Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court, Hon'ble Justice (Retd.) Mr. A.P. Shah. We hold Justice Shah in the highest regard for his intellect and courage in being a consistent voice for democratic rights - [**especially media freedoms**](https://www.livemint.com/Leisure/x3Es2gcvZvuZbYqwiWMQuN/Justice-AP-Shah--Judge-of-the-brave.html). Due to the lack of response by the IAMAI we, yesterday sent an open letter to Justice Shah highlighting our concerns and prior correspondence. This is in our continuing effort that self-censorship practices that have made TV broadcast an arid medium do not migrate to the internet. Our letter to Justice Shah is a good faith effort. While we have the highest faith in his ability to adjudicate and hold this position while protecting free expression. However, the larger, industry wide model that is being institutionalized and is likely to be cemented that will last beyond his term is injurious.

1. by judiciary based on claims of being a juvenile (*juvenile delinquent* is more like it)
2. by Delhi ~~cops~~ BJP militia who we are not sure whether they're even interrogating the pipsqueak
3. by BJP whose leaders made the call for terrorists to commit terror acts, but haven't been censured by EC, SC or parliament
4. by ~~media~~ modia like ANI which proactively tried to dig out evidence for him being a juvenile, and possibly even forged the said evidence according to one forensic investigation
5. by other media who are not following up the case
6. by complete neglect and silence from other political parties and politicians, which amounts to participating in this conspiracy of silence to protect a terrorist
7. by social media which have removed all proof of his organizational links to hindutva terror leaders and organizations like Deepak Sharma and Bajrang Dal.

This [Aljazeera report](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/delhi-shooter-classmate-wanted-hindus-200131202353308.html) is the only reliable information I've been able to find  but it too dates all the way back to Jan 31. After that nothing reliable. It's not even possible to search by name due to this conspiracy of protecting a terrorist.

Is he even being investigated? Is he being sent to Gen.Rawat's deradicalization camps? 

Or is he being fed prasad and lassi brought from the nearest shakha on Amit's special instructions?

I was born In Australia to Indian Immigrants and since birth I have had a gold tiger tooth necklace  on. My parents are pretty chill people but they are very superstitious about its importance and how I take care of it, where I place it etc. 

Initially I thought it was because it was gold but they don’t really treat other gold jewellery like my necklace. We are from a small village in Andhra Pradesh and I’m very curious about its significance and importance. I’ve asked them and they’ve never really answered me properly so thought I would ask here.

Cheers :)

It's been a little late for me to make resolutions for this year but we live in present and not past.

I think we all have the ability and audacity to think good and even exceptional things for ourselves. And I've learnt two things in life till now: whatever your goals are, let people know about it. It does two things: Firstly, people around you will help out and the secondly it will make you committed / liable.

So here it is:

Since I'm into public accounting and auditing, I've set a goal for myself to work with one of the big4 (**Deloitte, EY, PWC and KPMG**) in second half of 2020. 

For me it's a big deal to be a part of multinational and reputed accounting firms around the world. And I think it also serves a justice to my degrees as well.

So I've mapped out a plan which will help me in achievement of my goal. 

1. Everyday I would try to connect and speak with at least 1 recruiter and 3 people who are/were associate with those companies.
2. I will have my CV made from someone professional and experienced in this industry.
3. I will attend as many as networking events as possible and recite the same thing again to every person I come across in the hope of getting a connection somehow.
4. Try to schedule informational interviews if that's a thing in Dubai.
5. Make a professional video about my profile and upload it over social media.
6. Even I'll go one step further, upload all those networking and informational interviews videos on Youtube.
7. Maybe even run my Facebook and instagram ads against people who work in these organizations.
8. Last but not the least, prepare for that final day, EVERY SINGLE FUCKING DAY.

Now that would be it from my side and I'll leave out rest things on LUCK. 

Three things gonna happen from this post:

1. No-one responds (which is intact even worse) and I'll get on to my to-do list and check off every item listed above.
2. Someone who actually care about helping others and either work in these organisations or know someone there who can make things move would reach out to me.
3. And last one would be ones who will rant about everything.

Or just help me out on how to meet people and network with people over here in this part of the world? Coz I really want this thing man.",1581537630.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,4,3

7583,"A heart-warming story from Saharanpur, UP.Hello friends, 

I see you guys have been keeping yourself busy with the Delhi elections and its associated conundrums but allow me to share a heart-wrenching story that I heard from different perspectives on my recent trip to Saharanpur. I was at a party where there was this guy I was told about. I do not exactly know the timeline of events and it was all party atmosphere and people were just telling things what they knew or remember in short sentences. 

As Saharanpur is an old city, train junctions are relatively easy to find with the city perimeters and accidents are quite frequent. His father owned a restaurant quite close to the railway station and one day, he lost his legs as it got stuck in railway tracks and a train ran over it. He felt immense anguish as he was the bread-winner for this family and the burden of being handicapped got the better of him. He eventually died of a heart attack. The doctors reported that he was too stressed out due to the pronounced limp.

His father's younger brother (his chachaji) took over the restaurant to manage it. On a fine day, he had a few customers who were cops. After they ate, they were obviously not expecting to pay anything but since the family's financial situation was tight, chachaji asked the cops to at least pay the basic bill without paying for any profits (Rs 50). The situation was quite tense as they were already drunk. I am not really sure whether they paid or not but chachaji apologized and they went there way. 

Well, one of the cops later returned to the restaurant. He had gone back to his home to pick up his official revolver and when he came back, he started abusing chachaji and eventually murdered him. The intricate details were not told to me by anyone. In response, the family filed an FIR as it was the right thing to do. The cop was eventually put to jail and the trial began. 

However, while in jail as an undertrial, he contacted some of his mafia friends and issued a '*supari'* in the name of this guy whom I met at the party. He is presently around 28 years old charming and polity guy who would probably not wish anything bad on anyone. He did not even have anything to do with the whole ordeal. As innocent as he was, he was also helpless. With no parental figure around, his family was dependent on him for all emotional and financial needs. But he was not spared.

Some people came to the restaurant and shot him. But by god's grace, some wealthy families of Saharanpur came out to help pay his medical bills which compounded up to Rs 75 lacks. With proper medical attention, he has survived. Given the number of surgeries performed all over his body, he is still alive and kicking it. 

But the family was now very terrified. The cop told him to take the case back and he would let the son live. And that they did. The cop is still out there. He is still a cop. Most people in Saharanpur know about the story. 

I eventually found the courage to go talk to the guy and discuss if there is any help that I can offer. But given the resources and contacts that I have, I feel quite helpless. He told me not to worry about it as incidents like these are quite common in Saharanpur but then I realize that we can pull the lid off this one case, there is still hope of people are directly in conflict with law enforcement. I did talk to a friend who makes documentaries if he would be willing to take up this case but have not heard back from him yet. 

If there is anyone here who can help him in any way possible to get him justice in any form, I would be very grateful. He is willing to talk but I am not sure how many documents and pieces of evidence he has gathered. He has actually given up all hopes and I did not want to get his hopes high without having any tangible solutions. 

Thanks for reading.

7616,"Universal basic income in India : calculating the costsWith UBI becoming mainstream this year, I am trying to do a fun exercise of calculating the budget for a possible UBI in India.

**note**

* these calculations are being made with the assumption that government dose note cut any expenditure or spending in already existing programs. UBI will not mean underfunding of other programs`

* the calculations are being done with the worst case population scenario in mind. Current projections estimate India's population will peek at 180 crore people. 

**So, let's begin:**

Abhijeet Banerjee felt that rs 3000 per month was the realistic possible UBI in India.  Taking that as our figure, we get 

`Yearly UBI = 3000 * 12 = 36,000 rs per month `

Now, for the entire country, the total UBI budget would be 

= 180,00,00,000 * 36, 000

= 6480000,00,00,000

**~ Rs 65 lakh crore**

India's yearly budget ~**25 lakh crores**

So, in order to support UBI, India will have to tripe their budget somehow, which is impossible. 

However, if we set more realistic standards, maybe we can achieve some form of partial UBI. We can gradually extend UBI to entire society as our economy increases 

**phase 1**:

 This phase will target the poorest 20% of India. 

**The estimated budget would be 13 lakh crores**

This is definitely achievable. If state and center both share the costs equally, UBI phase 1 would be definitely possible. 

Just the advantages of UBI phase 1 would be immense :

* immediate expansion in income of poorest 20% of India 

* increase in consumption for domestic economy leading to prosperity for everyone 

* reduction in inequality

7667,"Can Indians grow a spine already?I am so sick of Indian men and women being pressured into arranged marriages. I am sick of the whole virginity being the sacred bowl of purity, sick of aunties who will keep on nagging you to get married. This is absurd. 

Everyone puts up the whole, 'Arranged marriages are done with consent' bs. Are they though? Deep inside everyone knows that the majority of the Indian population is pressured into marriage. 

Let's see, if someone pressures you to have sex, it is *sexual assault*, right? It is a crime. You shouldn't be pressured into *anything*, not even marriage. I can't believe how manipulative parents can get, 'I will slit my wrists if you don't get married', 'You will see my dead face if you don't get married'. Here's the thing, taking your own life needs a *lot of courage*, trust me, I have tried. *Your parents won't take their own lives for this*. You are an adult, probably earning, you can take care of yourself and take your own decisions. *Please don't be pressured and ruin two lives*, hell maybe 3 lives, if we assume that you will have a child. I am from a dysfunctional family, arranged marriage, of course, and my life has been hell. I remember wishing that my parents never got married, even if it resulted in me not being in this world. 

Here's the thing, life's already complicated, you need to earn, do your job, take care of yourself and others, etc, why make life more difficult with things that don't need to be complicated. Socialize, date, make friends, find common interests, know each other for *years*, marry. That's how biology of the body is. 

Some say that arranged marriages have a courtship period, but how long does it last? The maximum amount of time I have seen someone just being engaged in an arranged marriage is 1 year. Not to mention, the courtships can be in an controlled environment and fixed meeting and schedules. How can you be sure your partner wants to marry? Hell, how can you be sure? Is it because *this is just the next step*? What if your sexual libidos, kinks don't match?
 I, for a fact know that I won't marry someone until I have know them for atleast 3 years! It's sad to see where the society is going. You can say that that's how the culture of India is, but does the culture have any value if it suppresses and unnaturalizes the whole concept of love and relationships, the way biology works? If it affects mental health? After all, isn't culture just man-made? Only the positive aspects of culture should be kept. Relationships, sex, love are natural. Nothing *sacred*. If you want arrange marriage, good for you, just make sure your partner has *actually consented*.

Sincerely, a rant by me. Seeing my dear best friend in depression after being emotionally blackmailed into a marriage with same threats of suicide, 'log kya kahenge', etc has been terrible. Know that parents are not Gods, they are humans whom you should definitely respect but they *do* make mistakes. Even if love marriage doesn't work, you have yourself to blame, not your parents and part in your own terms. If you are pressured into a marriage, how can you say that you won't be pressured to no divorce? 

Stand up for yourself.

Edit: This is amusing. I would like to point out few things,

1) I am not claiming that *all* arranged marriages are forced. I have just stated how forced marriages do happen. Some people have taken it personally.  *I just feel it is projection*.
2) Many people are denying this, but it happens. A lot. To the point that it is so normalized that you don't feel it. *This is not a village thing. The friend I mentioned is from Mumbai*.
3) The ""I am a virgin, I want a virgin"". Okay, good for you, it's just, I feel that you are insecure about yourself. Atleast, that's how it looks like to me, as  a girl. (Oh, I am a *virgin* girl, so don't come at spewing shit like, ""You had sex that's why you don't want virginity to be considered""). If not, tell me why your partner's virginity matters to you, if it's not insecurity. It's a preference? Well, why is it? I mean, given the trend in the comments, most of you want to marry for sex. Which defiles marriage in itself, which you claim is sacred.
4) if calling me names, saying I am a weak shit for pointing out the obvious things happening in the society *and denying that it happens* makes you feel better, well, you do you. Classic ad hominem. Oh, you can say that I am generalising, and you know what, maybe I am, because generalizations always have a bit of truth of the society in them.
5) ""I won't get a good looking girl if I don't have an arranged marriage"". Oh my, that is so shallow. Just like a girl asking for 6 figures is wrong, then so is you asking for a good looking girl. Don't cry foul that women want money and gold diggers when you are just as shallow as them. I guess the quote should go, 'Don't judge a person until it's time for marriage'.
6) MARRIAGE IS NOT A CONTRACT AND DEFINITELY NOT A PASS FOR SEX. If you are marrying just for sex,   you are pitiful. Screams lack of confidence in yourself. People need to work on themselves, you don't get things you want just by sitting and hoping to get it. Since, most arguments are from men here, I have noticed that they are happy that they don't have to do anything and their parents get them a bride and sex while the bride gets 'financial security'. Reminds me of how you have to pay a prostitute to get sex, except here, it has a better name. 

Again, I would like to clear that I am against 'forced arranged marriages', though I am not a huge fan of the business like transaction of arranged marriages, what people want is none of concern. People have started bashing it as if I am totally against arranged marriage. Though, I have tried to counter the points which have been posted in defense of arranged marriage (and I didn't find them convincing). Though most of them argue about how arranged marriages are not bad, which I agree. *It's just how it happens here, is bad*. And I have tried to counter them too, though those have no relation to the whole point of the post. Which is how many are being forced into marriage and how it is so normalized in the present society.

Oof, formatting in reddit sucks. And I have realized that India has a *long, long* way to go. 

*Pretty ironic. A country in which romantic movies are usually the highest grossing, shuns love in real life.*

Today I would like to start a conversations on Podcast's state in India.

Recently I have been looking for Podcast for Indian listener and lot of podcast are basically on news or politics but for news or politics we already have plenty of sources...I am not saying we shouldn't we have podcasts on news or politics but nearly all of podcasts on politics or related (80% of it).

So coming back to point I as Indian listener want more of our desi podcasts related to pop culture, entertainment and many more genre, not just politics and I should not be dependent on foreign podcasts for entertainment, which I don't relate to.

There is one podcast in particular which stands out is The Awful and Awesome Podcast by Newslaundry which I religiously listen to as it is light hearted and fun to listen.

If you have any recommendations please share with me and with like minded people of Reddit.

Add this to the seats won:8

7735,"Qnet MLM fruadRecently, I was approached by one of my flatmates (say A) for a ""business opportunity"". He said his seniors are looking for someone to join their business and I am the first one who came to his mind. I thought it would be unwise to say no without even looking at the opportunity, so I said yes I would meet this senior. Now I knew he invested in some business and was quite busy and kept telling us that he's learning a lot and it's once in a lifetime opportunity, so clearly I was excited to be a part of such business. So I go to Starbucks to a mall nearby with A to meet this senior guy, let's call him VK. While I was waiting with A, he kept talking about how awesome VK is, and how much I am going to enjoy talking with him. So this guy VK comes and I meet him starts with some chitchat. After some chitchat he asks me 3 things:-

* Do I have capital or am I willing to take a loan (approx. 3-5 lakhs INR)?  
I said yes, I do have capital.
* Will I consult with someone before investing?  
I said yes I will consult my friend AM before investing as he's quite knowledgeable and I trust him.  
Then VK tries to convince me that I shouldn't because most will tell me what they've ""heard"" and might not be in my best interested.
* Why do I want to do a business?  
<Some legit reason>

Now he started telling me some stuff from business books and being a guy from technical background all that fascinated me. After a lot of business lecture he comes on what this company Qnet does. He said they have some exclusive products, they've been there for 22 years, they sponsor some football club etc. etc. and to enter this business I have to buy a product and sell it to 2 of my friends and the moment he drew a tree I knew it's a pyramid scheme but I also knew A is not idiot, he would've invested after thinking (I assumed as he is from IIT Roorkee and I knew him since 8 months) so I kept on listening thinking there might be some catch and all. During all this discussion he kept asking why I want to do a business, most probably to make me feel that this is the moment that can change my life. He starts showing off how close his mentor is to him and how everyone helps out each other and his mentor have a big house and they hang out with her and have fun etc. etc. After this he starts showing me calculations how I am going to be a rich in an year. After this he said I should invest in this business, it would be better if I do it on a loan as it will be the motivation and kept on pushing me that I should atleast lock my position now as if someone else comes before me they will get more commission then me ( a classic impulse selling technique ). They pushed me multiple times  to lock the position (which I considered as red flag) but I subtly declined (subtle as I live with A and don't want to make things awkward by being rude to the people matter to him).  So I came home started doing some research and found out a case is running in supreme court, high court declared them illegal and their original website is blocked by GOI. Supreme court gave bail to the people arrested so Qnet will use that as selling point. Dodged a bullet here. I would love to know if you have crossed your path with this entity and how was your experience.

So I went to the KYC details page and entered my Aadhar details. I was then given this error:

>Aadhaar authentication failed. AADHAAR number, Name, DOB or Gender mismatch with registered data.

Upon inspection, it appears that my employer had submitted my details without my middle name, but my Aadhar contains my middle name. It also appears that the only way to get it updated is for my employer to do it. I am no longer in touch with them.

Yediyurappa buckled under pressure and redistributed portfolios barely a day after they were given responsibilities. Pretty sure what his first step is going to be as minister.

I've recently purchased a delicate Bluetooth speaker.

To protect the speaker, I'm searching for a suitable cover. My speakers are quiet delicate and I consider them suitable for indoor use. However,if I choose to use them outdoors I would want to protect it from getting physically damaged (protect it from scratches, absorb a little shock, if it happens to fall from a small height ( as is the case with most Home/outdoor parties)

There are no protective cases/sleeves for the Bluetooth speaker model that I'm using that I could find online. 

Hence, I'm planning to make a custom silicon case for my speakers. 

Just like you get silicon cases for various mobile phones, I'm looking for someone who makes custome made Silicon cases to fit my BT speakers.

### Tl;dr

IFF has prepared a public brief highlighting the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. Technologies like CCTV cameras, location tracking and device monitoring have made it possible for employers to turn workplaces into a panopticon, and such pervasive surveillance undermines the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. We encourage you to read the brief and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee to ensure existing power imbalances between workers and employers are not exacerbated by the Bill.

### Your boss shouldn't be Big Boss

Much has been written about the exemptions provided under the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 for governmental surveillance but there is another form of surveillance which the Bill permits that we should all be worried about. Clause 13 of the Bill exempts employers from seeking consent prior to processing personal data of their employees for recruitment and termination of employment, provision of services and benefits, verification of attendance and performance assessment. With advancement in technology, employers now have the ability to continuously monitor the real time activity of their employees through CCTV cameras, location tracking, device monitoring etc. By allowing employers to track bathroom breaks, lunch breaks and meetings of employees, such technologies pose a threat to the dignity of labour and the ability of workers to unionise. 

### Recommendations 

In order to ensure that any workplace surveillance is strictly need based, context specific and minimize intrusion into the personal lives of employees, we recommend that the following changes are made to the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019.

1. The principles of necessity and proportionality should be included under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
2. A mandatory obligation should be imposed on the employer to consult employees and seek their views prior to processing personal data under Clause 13, PDP Bill 2019.
3. The Data Protection Authority should be entrusted with the responsibility of issuing a Code of Practice for workplace surveillance under Clause 50, PDP Bill 2019.
4. The Code of Practice for workplace surveillance issued by the Data Protection Authority should impose a prohibition on monitoring of any unionisation related activity and prescribe penalties for the same.
5. Trade Union affiliation should be categorised as sensitive personal data under Clause 3(36), PDP Bill 2019.

### Read the public brief and engage with the JPC

For more information, we encourge you to read our public brief on the impact of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019 on workplace surveillance. The brief highlights the impact of workplace surveillance on the fundamental right to unionise guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) and the fundamental right to privacy guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution. It further explains existing provisions relating to workplace surveillance under the Bill and discusses their pros and cons. Following from the earlier discussion, the brief finally recommends five changes to the Bill to ensure that the existing power imbalances between employers and employees are not exacerbated by pervasive workplace surveillance.

If you are a trade union or employee association which needs more information about the Personal Data Protection Bill 2019, please feel free to reach out to us at policy@internetfreedom.in. We encourage people to share this brief widely in their circles and participate in the consultation being held by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Bill. You can participate in the consultation by sending comments via email to [**jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in**](mailto:jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in) and [**mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in**](https://saveourprivacy.in/admin/entries/blog/mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in) by 25 February 2020.

Hey, I'm 15 and I just wanted to make this post cause I have a few things on my mind about our country, more specifically the people and society in general. So I wanted to share an incident/situation I faced recently which got me thinking. Basically I have a mustache as most teens my age do, you know that weird stupid looking shit. I hate it and I felt like I was looking like an uncle so I decided to shave it off completely and that seriously messed up everything at school for me like I actually got fucking bullied for that. Its not like I was an unpopular kid, people knew me, I had friends, it wasn't like I got bullied regularly before but then boys and girls started commenting on how I looked like a 'Hinjda', 'Chakka', Transgender etc. and the worst part was my math teacher embarrassed me in front of the whole class by saying I look like the male version of another girl in the glass. He also called me a 'Hinjda' multiple times. I'm already skinny and I get told a lot that I should eat more and I sometimes get pushed around but that was fine as I could handle that. But this. This was at a whole other level. I skipped school by making excuses just so I could avoid people. And this whole incident really got me thinking how the people of India (not everyone) are just so fucking toxic. Like why do people have a problem with everything? Its my mustache and I absolutely fucking hate it but no I can't cut it anymore because I get bullied if I do so. People here are extremely transphobic too which really pissed me off because why can't you just accept someone for who they are? People of India really have problems (again not saying everyone) Like the Indian society is extremely transphobic, sexist and even racist. Its filled with toxicity and people just can't let other people be themselves. That's why I decided I wanted to leave India possibly after 12th for higher studies, made a post asking for some info on Reddit and sure enough one of the comments said, ""Desh drohi"" which again comes to why the fuck do you care if I leave the country or not? Its literally a sub-reddit for people looking to study abroad. Why are you even here if you have a problem against that? I'm not afraid to admit that I don't like India anymore. I wanna settle abroad in a country where people have a good mindset. I just can't stand this toxic shit hole anymore where I can't find like minded individuals who have the same thoughts as me.  Anyways just wanted to get this off my mind before my 10th boards start in a few days. What are your thoughts regarding this? Thanks for reading. Sorry for the long post!

But not much to my surprise, voters of Delhi gave this huge mandate against the decisive policies and stood up with a progressive approach.

Now as the analysis were going on, experts on TV pointed out some really interesting traits of Kejriwal's Election campaign, which were basically some core reasons behind this victory:

>Not getting into communal vs secular scenario

>Made arguments on work profile.

>Assumed a soft hindutva position. Rejected an Idea that is Hindutva but not a belief that is Hinduism.

>Redefined 'Nationalism'. Rejected Bhajapa's version of the same thing.

>Avoided any direct, serious 'Dig' at NaMo

>Avoided Shaheen bagh

7936,"I'm so sick of being told (explicitly or otherwise) that I'm not ""Indian enough"" to speak about things.Simply because I prefer - and indeed use much more often - English. And not Hindi. In fact my major was in English Literature (I graduated a few months ago with quite a good GPA), and I'm currently also learning French (in B1 currently) and Spanish OR Russian (I will pick one to start learning by myself in March, classes are expensive and I'm not in a metro city either) . Sometimes I feel like I'm always overcompensating by wanting to master other languages, except Hindi.

(This is a long ish 4 AM rant so if you would like to check out right now, I don't blame you, sir or madam. No hard feelings. But there's so much shit going on in my personal life - depression, OCPD, suicide contemplations daily and trying to get over the loss of my dog a few months ago, whom I needed now more than ever, plus the losses of close family members over the last 4 years - that if I don't vent the smaller things like this to people, I don't know how I could go on. But this is ultimately all my problem so I'm sorry for wasting your time. ) 

Am I bad at Hindi? No. I can speak, listen, read and write easy (the latter two are a bit dicey, because I can't instantly grasp the Sanskrit-y megawords and in writing, my matra game is messy lmao). As a child I always loved languages - Hindi included - but the difference between French, English and Hindi ended up being, for me, about the teachers. I learn from warm, affectionate yet professional people. Anyone who teaches through fear will not get through me.

Perhaps a timely mention should be made about my board - CBSE. Yeah. It's changed now (not really - students are just more aware of what shit can fly or not) but CBSE Hindi teachers.... Ruled by fear. In my experience, at least. All the floor in charges, the supervisors, staff representatives - used to be these angry, bitter, old women who looked like they moonlighted as the guardians of Hades. Fuck appearances, I know that's shallow and younger me also knew it - and so I tried my hardest to learn. But their personalities were 2x worse. 

Yet, in my school life, the only two times I've been slapped were by Hindi teachers, and I think that has made the difference to me. I used to cry my heart out before a hindi exam, and my mom used to teach me - getting straight A's in everything except Hindi, in which I was grateful to get like, B+ or C. I wouldn't say exactly that it was the crystallization point, but definitely a catalyst in my estrangement from mAtRa bHaAshA (I know it's not the official language, we have like 20) 

So I get this very often - I type in complete sentences, in English, and I don't send hindi messages very regularly at all. People assume this is me being a snobbish rat, and if I send a ""Kaisa hai bhai?"" it becomes a THING. When I talk about literature and mostly fixate on western writers, it's a THING. Someone even called me white randomly when I was discussing favourite authors. I.. I may be ignorant about Indian literature (btw the curriculum taught at my college for this was TRASH, AND SO UNDERDEVELOPED COMPARED TO WESTERN LIT). I was recently arguing with my dad about the CAA and whilst he is NOT a Bhakt, he does heavily lean towards the BJP - though our discourses are often informative rather than shouting matches. He said ""You know, you sound like someone who has only been educated in English and nothing else"". Why is my opinion on the CAA related to my knowledge of Hindi?? 

Since when is this a bad thing? Since when is liking a language other than Hindi and being more comfortable in it such a horrible thing? Am I looking down on people who are speaking hindi? Fuck no. I'm talking in hindi half the time anyway.

So yes, reddit, I'm sorry for venting this but I've just been carrying this weird guilt for such a long time. I'm currently unemployed and sit locked up in my room 24/7, I keep getting told I should apply for the prestigious unis abroad and just keep studying there and TEACH there. When I say that I want to teach in India, I get this condescending look of as if ""bless, your life is going to be so tough"". Like???

On one hand I'm reinforcingly told I'm a fiRaNGI and then when I say I want to help here - like my English and French teachers took me, a 16 year old suicidal dude and gave him faint hope of being good at something - I get told na bro teaching in India is so pakao. EArN iN dOllAz anD sTaY tHerE. And there was this annoying asshole of a best friend I had in the past who wouldn't reconnect with me because I didn't go to an ivy like him (he didn't say it directly, but yes he believes it and makes me feel so small) . Like I'm sorry for not being rich??? 

It's so confusing. Also please don't drag me because I'm aware this is a micro micro 'problem', especially in view of the mess going on in our country but I will just say that this has been very real for me and I feel nervous at just the thought of going out and being a defacto Indian cultural representative when I've been made to feel like I'm a tourist all my life, when all my fondest childhood memories are such Indian experiences - trips to Vaishno Devi, Golden temple, eating paani puri, gorging thumbs up by the liters etc.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

1. Wash your hands frequently
2. Practice respiratory hygiene. Cover mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing. Wash hands afterwards and discard mask or tissue.
3. Maintain social distancing
4. Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth
5. If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Consult a doctor.
6. As a general precaution, practice general hygiene measures when visiting live animal markets, wet markets or animal product markets
7. Avoid consumption of raw or undercooked animal products
8. If you become sick while travelling, inform crew, seek medical attention early and share travel history.

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you’re ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that’s ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you’ve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It’s ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.",1581476391.0,,Coronavirus,dark,5592,755

What if BJP has decided not to rig ‘this’ elections to curb the discontent among people? 
plus, it would’ve been dead give away of EVM mal-functioning /hacking if they’d decided to have ‘favourable’ results.

I was confused as to what vaccine, because I thought there isn't a vaccine yet. They were saying  it was recommended by the  government and everyone is  taking it to be safe and I should take it too. They then told me it’s a homeopathic medicine that everyone is taking to be safe from corona virus. Its called Ars Alb 30. A homeopathic medicine based on Arsenic Album. I laughed it off and told them its all stupid whatsapp forwards and homepathy doesn’t work etc etc and didn't bother much about it.

I gave them to my sis and she asked my why I am giving her [this](https://i.imgur.com/qVKmkZQ.png). I was baffled and eventually realized this was the ""corona vaccine"". I told her to ignore it and she did.

I mean I really do love to drive but whenever I start thinking about driving during the day my heart starts to feel super heavy.
When driving I sometimes start to feel defence less as even tho something happens and it might not be my fault the other guy might get at me ( i am kinda fattu) 
Last Friday I had an little accident just a small bent (e-rickshaw crashed in me ) and at that time my heart was beating so fast although since then I feel like my anixety issue has gone down a bit . Papa bhi bol rahe tha ""thok Di na koi na ab badhiya driver hogaya hai Tu "".. sahi se Chala bhi pa Raha hu

I would love to hear from people who have had been in the same shoe as me and how they got over it : )

8130,"My own fact checking: Renuka Jain shared a possibly hoax scientific study on vedic ritualsSo Miss Renuka Jain, the one who became famous for her video saying people don't 'deserve Modiji', shared a 2011 The Hindu article claiming that an ancient Hindu ritual has been proved by scientists to be extremely beneficial for atmosphere. 
The Tweet:
https://twitter.com/RenukaJain6/status/1226702402599866370

The article:
https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/ancient-fire-ritual-has-positive-impact-on-environment-scientists/article2103881.ece#

In this, a guy named Prof VPN Nampoori is said to have been researching on an ancient Vedic ritual called ""Athirathram"" which he claimed germinates seeds at a much faster rate, etc. He said:

> “The findings would not only help dispel superstitious notions associated with Vedic rituals but also help in continuation of such tradition for the betterment of nature and the environment,” says Nampoori.

This didn't sit right with me, so I went to Google to search on this. Being a fan of a YouTuber Potholer54, I wanted to get some research papers, not media articles. And as I suspected, I found none. Even in his own profile in his University, there is no such study. I searched his LinkedIn, ResearchAcademy, etc but didn't find anything (I may have missed something, its possible). Rather I found this:

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/kerala-professor-cusat-suspended-allegedly-fudging-data-while-authoring-articles-64342

This news article accuses him of fudging data. I further found this:

https://ssmkerala.org/teamssm.html

This is a pseudoscience movement, basically trying to 'fuse Hinduism with Science', you know, the usual pseudoscience mumbo jumbo like Deepak Chopra. This professor is a member of RSS too. Joined together, this clearly indicates that this was a hoax study just like the one that ISRO used 'Vedic Maths' in their calculations for their recent space mission, circulated by right wingers. I am still searching about it, if I find something, I will update.

I am still a little shocked though as to why a reputed media like The Hindu would share such a hoax.",1581415949.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,5,64

8134,"Question about getting international driving license in India as foreignerFellows,

I'm a Canadian foreigner looking to tour around the country on a two-wheeler for a few months. Yes, I'm aware of the risks. I've been trying to get the license sorted out for about a week and I'm very confused. I know I need an international driver's license. No question about that. I have no such thing, and cannot get it from abroad. But I have my Canadian license with me. 

So far, everybody has had a different story about the process and the legalities. 

- This [website](https://www.evisaindia.org/guide-to-driving-in-india/) tells me RTO can issue an IDL/IDP from my license.

- Official tourist office told me all I need a 6-month permission to drive in India, issued at RTO.

- Went to RTO. After being sent from one guy to another, everybody trying to get rid of me, I ended up talking to some guy who told me no such thing exist as a permission, and I need to get the IDL. Multiple frustrating visits later, where they tell me to come back tomorrow, I managed to talk to someone else who told me they don't issue IDL to holders of tourist visa, only work visa. Normally, I'd take their word for it, but these guys barely spoke English and were arguing between eachother.

- Heard about photoshopped IDL. I'd rather stay away from that.

- Guy who organizes motorbike tours around the country tells me my Canadian license would be enough. 

- Many foreigners report driving on the short-term without any IDL, no problem with the police. I know people get targeted in Goa for that. Also, since I want to drive all across the country, I'm expecting to come by much more checkpoints, where I'm expecting to be prime target for any police officer. 

- Then again, heard a story about a Canadian couple who toured around the country for two months, no IDL, no problem. 

So who do I listen to? Starting without any IDL seems tempting, but if I'm gonna pay a 500-1000Rs bribe every checkpoint, I might as well just stick to the train.

Thanks!

Edit: Btw, my license is in French. It doesn't say Canada, but Quebec, which makes it even more confusing for everybody.

Edit 2: Motor Vehicles Act of 1988, section 9/a/iii says I should be able to get a license. I'm tired of arguing with the RTO.",1581427268.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,11

I  know for sure that I would be for uniform civil code even though I am  highly dissatisfied with CAB/NRC. I feel Uniform civil code will ensure true egalitarianism for all people irrespective of religion. Whatever laws exist in India, should apply to all people.

There is an  argument to be made that liberty and right to expression are threatened  because of this. If anyone feels this way, I would like to know your stance on egalitarianism vs right to expression. Where is the line that you draw? Is uniform civil code encroaching upon your freedom?

Indian politics is now in a new phase where your 'Party face' matters more than your party or your ideologyAs the final results trickle in, exit polls have been proven true that a quarter of bjp and Congress voters have switched to 'kejriwal' in Delhi elections. AAP knew that Kejriwal's popular image is their biggest strength and they used it perfectly. From a campaign centered around kejriwal (""lage raho kejriwal"") to posing this question to Delhi voters :**""kejriwal vs who""**.

Gone are the days when a party enjoys blind loyalty just because of past history. As the opposition recovers from 2019 drubbing at hands of modi, it seems that they have realised that any election campaign now requires a strong and popular leader to anchor their campaign.

All the elections in which bjp have been defeated in past few years have one thing in common, the opposition had a strong regional leader

* rajasthan : sachin pilot

* karnataka : siddaramiah (Congress got more votes than bjp)

* Odisha : naveen patnaik

* punjab : captain Amarinder Singh

* maharashtra : sharad pawar (Congress pretty much gave up in maharashtra and didn't even bother campaigning while sharad pawar was doing rallies even in heavy rains)

* Jharkhand : Hemant soren

* telangana : KCR

* Tamil nadu : stalin

* Andra pradesh : Jagan


Indian voters are smart. Political pandits think that the average voter is an idiot who can't distinguish between state and national elections.

In not even a single state election has bjp managed to even come close to their national vote share. People know that modi won't be resigning as PM and coming to their state. Moreover, state elections are fought on different issues and environment than national elections. This was clear in Delhi where while bjp was going on a rampage about shaheen bagh, 50% of the voters didn't even know about it, while the rest didn't understand or care ahout it.

8239,"Conspiracy Theory: The case of EVM tampering in New Delhi electionsIf you are looking at the results you know that AAP has won the election and Arvind Kejriwal will be the CM of Delhi for next five years. This was expected and gives India some hope.

However, given that BJP did no work in the last 5 years and spread so much hate, it looked very unlikely that they could win any seats. Anything more than 5 would be suspicious.Since they have got 7 already.. just wanted to  open this thread for discussion if there was foul play to ensure that they win a couple of seats so that they don't get under scrutiny (Coz AAP won.. and people wouldn't mind the few seats lost to BJP) 

Am I being too sceptical here? It would not harm to analyze the seats won by BJP and if it was of any significant importance to them. I am not much of a political pundit but have been following people's opinions for Delhi elections and believe that there is some foul play.. however insignificant it might seem.

8240,"Need advice in reference to corporate laws of hiring and firing individuals.Hello all, I'm not sure if this post is in keeping with the rules, and sorry for the vague title, i couldn't come up with anything better.

My brother was recently hired in a designing firm, currently on 6 month probation period before being made permanent employee. 2 weeks into this job, he had an unfortunate accident in his PG. After brief first aid, he went to the office where everyone was concerned looking at his condition and convinced him to take the day off, the HR even said that they'll see that there's no problem in him taking leave.

He had to take 2 more days of leave as his condition slightly worsened and would've hampered his ability to work.

A couple days ago, before the accident, he had talked to his immediate superior about getting 2 days of leave in March to visit his family back home. She had approved his leave. (There's no record of this leave approval as the conversation was face to face, and he now regrets in retrospect not having a physical paper trail)

Today when he went to office, he received an email from his manager saying that since he had already taken 3 days of leave, and there are only 3 paid leaves available in the 6 month probation period, his leave couldn't be approved. If he was willing to take unpaid leave, that could be worked out. He was okay with the unpaid leave, and he said so in reply.

The manager meanwhile had CC'd the CEO in the above-mentioned email, who then proceeded to call my brother in an ongoing meeting, and ripped him a new one, for taking unapproved leaves in the 2nd week of joining, for having the audacity to ask for more leaves, for his carefree attitude regarding the unpaid leave offer, and for being unprofessional and undeserving of working in a professional firm with work ethics, completely desregarding the work he'd put in in such a short time in the job, and his impeccable skill set. He then told the HR to resolve the issue of ""this unprofessional man"" in another room at the earliest.

My brother pleaded with the CEO and HR, tried explaining everything that had led upto today, and even said he'd cancel the tickets and would'nt ask for another leave in the probation period.

The HR and his manager then gave him an ultimatum, that the only way he'd get to keep his job was if his CTC was deducted by 12K for the next 6 months, and he'd take a pay cut, which would reduce his salary by quite a lot.

She then proceeded to give him 30 seconds to decide whether he wanted to show commitment to staying (which he did), or to hand in his resignation immediately.

He's currently on break, completely blanked out, just staring at his food, unsure of what to do next. I tried consoling him, but I'm a student and have no idea about the workings of that world, and I don't know what to do. Is there any recourse?


This ran a little longer than intended, thank you in advance for reaching the end.

TL;DR : Brother joins new firm, is on probation period, had to take leave due to accident, pre-approved leaves cancelled, got torn apart by CEO, asked to hand in resignation or take a pay cut. Major stressing.",1581411939.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,10

1. Feb 1st - I ordered Pizza with promised 30 minutes delivery. Order was delayed, I got the feeling and put my call setting by default to record options.

&#x200B;

1. I called the manager and of course their own service at 011-6888-6888 and talked to him and the restaurant manager repeatedly. and they ensured and the refund will be provided.
2. I called them back on 7th  - The customer Care person said it would reflect by Monday - 10th of Feb.
3. So, that was a lie - I called back on 10th and when I angrily asked - they asked me complaint number. Sorry, what? I got really frustrated. But I live here, I've never abused someone in my life, but in that moment, I thought if I had him in front of me, I wouldn't abuse by maybe smack his head repeatedly to the pillar until his brain falls apart.
4. I took a deep breath instead and told that I don't have such number - but he said, I should have one.
5. I tried the restaurant - which cried that it was too late, maybe order and they'll cut the refund amount from it. (I know this is what they always do, but enough is enough)
6. I tried talking to another representative today, and I specifically told him to transfer the call to his senior - that son of a \*\*\*\*\* put me ona hold me almost 10 mintes and then tells me that he talked to the restaurant and I should order and I'll get the refund amount deducted from this pizza's price. (another murder happening inside my head.)
7. I told him that I was going to call consumer helpline, and then logged on to  [https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/](https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/)  and there I saw FSSAI licence something, which I've no idea about. (Can someone help me with it.)
8. I didn't lose hope yet. There were numbers, and I called them. The nice machine cut my calls saying ""No agents available."" (WTF?)
9. Then I tried messaging Domino's on twitter, (I had posted on twitter on Feb 1) and as usual still no replies.
10. This is when I lost hope.

TLDR: Hi, I really need to register a complaint against Domino's India, for not refunding and then ghosting me after their promised 10 day passed. Lost hope. and If anyone knows what's their Green Park's FSSAI number?",1581427314.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,18,47

Also, I want to give him a message that, don't compare their party with other parties, be like Apple(the iPhone maker) they never compare their products with products made by other companies. They compare with the last model of that product.

8270,"My thoughts on the winning of AAP in Delhi today [11/02/2020] and some other thoughts.First things first, AAP deserves that huge win considering the condition our country is going through.

Now coming to the issue that was bothering me for a few days that the dirtiest of politics were being played before polling, be it physically or on social media. I am not going to list them here, but it was dirty. 
After polling was finished and the exit polls were clearly indicating an easy win for AAP, BJP ministers were confident that they would win in Delhi. Even before polling Amit Shah had said that the results would be really shocking to some people indicating the party's win. 

This made me bothered that why was this being discussed instead of the BJP's manifesto. Then on Saturday night I got the news that the official numbers for the voter turnout were quite delayed. EVM tampering was coming to my mind. Then when today I saw AAP taking lead throughout, I was honestly relieved that people of Delhi were not swayed by the emotion that Modi plays with. 

I mean if you look from an outsider's perspective, AAP did what a government should do no matter what: improve the current condition and provide. And they did it without talking about religion, Pakistan, the Army, anti-national, Shaheen Bagh, Ram Mandir, Hindutva, Hindu Khatre me hai, Mughals phir aa rahe hain, etc. There is so much hate, I don't know how it came. I mean for hell, we can't live with each other if we know who we support or not support. 

India is 2nd population wise in Muslims. India should concentrate in getting its stake in OIC (Organisation of Islamic Countries) and discuss diplomatic issues. What are we doing instead, ""Musalmaan is desh me badh raha hai to usko hatana chahiye. Hindu khatre me hai"". We are going backwards in that front, honestly. Religion is a private thing between the individual and God. Why make it a political issue?

India is said to be the largest democracy in the world. I felt proud of this statement growing up and hearing it in India and in a global level. But quite sadly, democracy of our country is in danger. Ridiculous things are happening. Law and order is a joke sometimes. I don't care what the students of JNU were doing, a mob came and thrashed them one by one. Police did nothing. Police tear gassed the library in Jamia, broke the mosque, hostel property, etc. No action on anybody except the students. Again students were thrashed before polling day at Jamia by the police. 
Parked cars inside homes and other property of people were destroyed by police in Uttar Pradesh. Is this what you call democracy? Is this good governance? People who question anything become anti-national and if it is a Muslim, he/she becomes a 'Jihadi'. Why? And the other times it becomes the fault of Nehru, or the Congress rule. When the BJP is the government, we will ask the BJP, no? We won't dig up Nehru's grave and question him that why our economy in 2020 sucks.",1581430694.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,13

8292,"Is there any Degree/Diploma/Certification I can achieve in a year's time?Hi. I'm a 17 year old student and I'm giving my board exams rn.

It's been a dream of mine to join the NDA and become a fighter pilot in the Indian Air Force, failing which, at least be an officer in the Air Force or the Army.

However I'm not really physically fit enough to be able to pass the SSB. I'm overweight and I've got minor knock-knees. Both can be fixed but it'll take time, at least a year I reckon.

So I'm considering taking this year off i.e not join a long 4 year engineering course or 5-6 year MBBS course like many of my friends and instead focus on myself. I want to focus on my fitness and obtain skills like being able to speak, write and read another language.

However I don't want to 'waste' this year or have nothing to show for it. So, coming back to my question, is there any Degree/Diploma/Certification that I can achieve in a year and that I preferably can do from home (i.e learn at home and give an exam kind of thing)?

This is not a final plan for me or anything but I'm just really confused and kinda scared rn. I've only ever dreamed and thought of being in the Armed Forces and I've never really considered any other career. Now that the possibility of that happening is looking slim, I don't really know what to do. I love movies and I love playing video games and I like the idea of becoming a video game developer (not as much as joining the armed forces but still) but I don't really have any idea of how to go about that either.

So I'm hoping you guys can offer me some advice here, thanks.",1581416110.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,25

8344,"Recently on one of my horny adventures online I discovered a scummy scammer thing going on in some subreddits related to Poonam Pandey and Sherlyn Chopra.Unless you have been living under a rock or are super Pawam level 10000 you would know that the aforementioned ladies have started making what can only be described as the thirstiest of thirst videos, not exactly porn but hardcore tease.

We all know the thirst level in our population is extremely high owning to a variety of reasons so these ladies are trying to make money off of it, to that I say, more power to them.

In the videos they sort of show their body parts(except for genitalia) in strip videos for which you have to download an app or go to their websites and then pay for the content but as all are well aware WE WANT EVERYTHING FOR FREE.

So these subs have popped up like pimples or acne on reddit in the name of these ladies (they have nothing with these subs) which provides the paid videos of these ladies for ""FREE"".

or do they?

It is very strange because I follow a lot of other NSFW subs and those people simply post the videos to the sub or through another site like gyfcat or giphy so that the video can be watched right on reddit but these shady fuqs are shady so what they do is post an image with a link in the comment for the download to the ""free"" video.

Now this download is not a simple download but one of those scummy 2010 website downloads filled with adware and malware or trying to trick you to click on something that starts a random download.

Sometimes unless you download the adware/malware you are not given access to the download.

I am more than certain there are a whole bunch of naive fueled by Jio data horny people that are downloading these things onto their PCs or phones. 

I found another thing through these places which led me to a softcore not so pornish porn production house website which gives you access to their amazing works for free\*. 

\*your data including you phone number as the price among who knows what else

Funny how porn sites are safer than these subreddits.

I wish we could stop links like those from being shared on reddit but I can also see that would cause problems for the legit links that truly help people instead of claiming to be altruistic but in reality being insidious like the links in these subs. 

I hope and pray that some of the people that go to those subs read this post and stay the fuq away from those links.",1581352739.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,11,48

I'm not a gamer, it's good if I can play some games in low settings, but ofcourse can go without it.

Should have a good display, not the most accurate, but reasonably bright and clear.

Should be futureproof regarding the ram, any amount of pre-installed ram is OK, but should be able to upgrade to atleast 16, (better 32) gigs, should have an SSD slot and a sata slot. 

Backlit keyboard, usb c port is needed. Ryzen 3500U or intel 8265 is enough I guess. I'm happy with either. Will be using external speaker so sound system not a priority. Backup should be reasonably good, 5-6 hrs for movies or ms powerpoint?

8534,"Why I decided to ditch the CINEMA OF INDIA and turn a Brad Pitt fan forever!Well! I always stood up to the West that Indians do make World class films, because we do make incredible movies with barely any budget in fact. But when it comes to the part they play in Social causes it's just a lot of fodder I believe. Today Brad Pitt was the first winner of the night, and immediately used his speech to attack the way the impeachment proceedings against US President Donald Trump were handled. He said and I quote, ""They told me I only have 45 seconds up here, which is 45 seconds more than the Senate gave John Bolton this week."" as Pitt probably doubts that president of the United States might have got away with Quid pro quo. I really don't care if Trump did or didn't do it just like if ""BJP is trying to represent the Hindu Communalism."" But I do care when an actor/actress in reasonable amount of safe and powerful environment rolling around in top down cars earning money out of the public but shying away from making their views public to create a positive effect especially at a time when the country is divided over CAA-NRC. Tanhaji gets a tax exemption which is ridiculous as a movie relating acid attacks, which I believe is a serious problem in the so called biggest democracy in the world doesn't deserve such an exception clearly because Deepika stood at some protest without saying a word.

I don't care if BJP is right or wrong but I expect the big guys to make a difference for the kind of money they make out of the movie goers.

8623,"Please help, my family is contemplating suicideI come from a family of four where I'm the eldest child and I have a younger brother (19) who is diagnosed with severe autism. He also has problems with his knees, so he can't walk properly and uses the wheelchair.

I'll explain the background about my brother. He was diagnosed at the age of 2 where he couldn't show signs of speech (a major red flag). The doctors advised my parents to give him therapy for improvement. We admitted him to special schools, brought in special needs teacher, etc. He did home schooling for some time but the improvement was nil. He always got stuck on numbers and basic three and four lettered words. By the time he turned 13, he threw tantrums about not wanting to be schooled by tearing notebooks, screaming and breaking pencils. My parents stopped teaching him after that, seeing that there was no room for improvement. Add to the fact that the involved professionals were only focused on getting paid well and not focusing on quality and improvement of the boy. The only good thing to consider is the fact that he can understand what we speak, and he shows what he wants by hand gestures (not official sign language). Since he grew up with me till I moved to another city for college, he behaved properly and acted in a way that was acceptable to (at least) us. I was very strict and scolded him if he created mischief and trouble for our parents, so he would keep quiet. He also adjusted if we faced any troubles.

Fast forward to today, his violence has gotten worse. By worse, I mean extremely worse beyond imagination. He hits, claws, kicks, throws plastic furniture on my parents. Every kind of physical abuse. Both of them have scars all over their hands. They do hit him back for self defense, but he gets much more abusive and violent. When my parents cry, he laughs at them. He throws groceries, tears clothes, bed sheets, curtains, all kinds of textile, etc. My parents buy them again, only for him to continue this wasteful cycle. Told him time and time again that money doesn't grow on trees but he doesn't care anyway. This is also shameful to write this in a public social media site, but he gazes lustfully at me and my mom and we don't go near him at all. It's disgusting. I know he's my brother, but I can't accept that kind of behaviour displayed to me and my mother. He also indulges in excessive masturbation during midnight (he got caught doing that when we went to check up on him in his room).

I live in another city for work, while the expected logical choice is for me to stay with my family and work from there. That's where the problem lies. Since we both grew up together, he would stay quiet even when I went to school. But now, my parents want me to resign work and stay at home to look after him 24/7. This created a strife within my family because they also suggested similar in the past. They told me to drop college to look after him. I do go home for the holidays and stay for some time. He sits quietly while I am at home and watches TV. However, if he ever tries to raise a hand on my parents knowing front of me, I hit him. I am perfectly aware that what I'm doing is participating in abuse but I cannot just sit quietly and let my parents get beaten like that. He was the one who started this first. Sometimes I take leave outside the holidays but I cannot take leave too often. I need to work because we have financial issues to deal with too.

Since the holiday season is over, me returning here somewhat boosted his abusive behaviour even more. He attacks my parents for talking, sneezing, coughing, etc. He only wants silence and on top of that, he expects this ridiculous cycle of his to be followed every single day without any objections:

-Dad should cook breakfast, go to office, come back home for lunch, buy restaurant food, got back to office return home in the evening and cook dinner.

-Mom should only cook lunch. Vegetable chopping should be done in front of him. But he will eat only restaurant food for lunch and of there's a favourite dish of his, home cooked food also included in his plate.

-No leftovers must be remaining. They all go into the trash.

-He will only watch sexual content shown on music channels on TV. If any educational or news content was running, he'd glare, get up and hit my parents.

-He pees and poops in his pants on purpose to see my parents suffer. A baby would be better in this regard because it learns. My brother is only regressing at this point and is worse than an animal.

Additionally speaking, we have relatives in name only. My parents' relatives and friends ostracized us from their circles and treat us like unwanted beings. Even my friends chose me as a target for them to bully because I have a brother like this and didn't try to understand and support me (except in college and work). What's so wrong about a challenged person? They're human beings too, they just need more special care and attention. Our neighbours drag their children and run away from us as if we're the Addams family. It's not like autism's contagious. Those people running away at the sight of us know this too. Relatives only tried to take advantage of us but we didn't relent so they resorted to slander and humiliation since they weren't able to successfully scam us using this boy as an excuse. As a result, we're really isolated from the rest of the world. We have no one to help us at all.

Now it has escalated to the point that my parents are thinking of committing suicide. I literally shouted at them after hearing this. I can't keep my cool. Very often I told them to take them to a new therapist but that suggestion falls on deaf ears. Also suggested them to admit him to an institute but they don't want to because they think he will die or get killed from neglect. There's a limit to spoiling him. It's because of the past experience where the professionals only took money and didn't really do anything to improve him. I know I've written some mean things about him but I hate him now. I hate him for the fact that he's abusing my parents and making all of us helpless. I hate how he enjoys making us suffer.

Trust me, I even was about to call the police to come and take him away but before I could do that my parents stopped me. My friends are telling me not to go home too often because that would lead to give up on my career. I am stuck between continuing my career and looking after my family. To my parents, the only solution to control his behaviour is for me to give up my job and look after him 24/7. Then why did they make me study? Am I selfish for wanting to do work?

What am I supposed to do now? What is the solution to this problem here? He is showing no signs of changing for the better. He's creating stress for everyone.

TL;DR: Autistic brother abusing my family and I am helpless with the situation. Need a solution to deal with this.

**EDIT1**: Thank you for reading and giving answers and support! I am grateful and right now, I'm looking for a list of institutes for him. Hope my parents agree this time.

**EDIT2**: forgot to mention he had first epilepsy at the age of 12 and the last time he had one was 3 years ago. His abusive behaviour reaches its peak whenever there is a full moon and new moon. We are puzzled as to why this happens and it's not a coincidence. Observations regarding this were made for 1 year.",1581326882.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,63,205
8624,"Online video streaming and TV are not the same. So why is the IAMAI trying to make it so?&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/8eg115wm63g41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4d3f525378619929710e095120e911c67ca2ab5c

## TL; DR:

On 5th February, 2020 the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) announced the launch of its Code for Self Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers. Among other things it provides the basis for the creation of the Digital Content Complaint Council (along the lines of a similar system in place for TV) to oversee content creation and distribution in the online video streaming space. Although there are only four signatories (as opposed to nine in the case of a previous iteration), there are rumbling that the group is seeking government endorsement of this initiative. We have written to the IAMAI and copied the letter to both the Union Ministries of Information & Broadcasting; and Electronics and Information Technology highlighting how this will lead to self-censorship to the detriment of internet users, creators, producers and competition within the market. Based on these grounds we have asked the industry body to roll back the code and asked government authorities to refrain from endorsing the framework.

## Background

This post is to update everyone that there is a risk brewing in India’s online video streaming space. And said risk could see us sleep walk into a scenario where online content in India, mimics its formulaic television counterpart. On 5th February 2020, at its annual India Digital Summit, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) launched its *Code for Self-Regulation of Online Curated Content Providers*. It follows up an earlier *Code of Best Practices for Online Curated Content Providers* the industry body had  put out in January 2019.

Unlike the previous code which had nine signatories, the latest iteration has just four signatories namely, Hotstar, Voot, Jio and SonyLiv. Prior signatories including Netflix, Zee5, AltBalaji, Arre and ErosNow were conspicuously absent at the new code’s launch. Other major players like Amazon (Prime) and Google (YouTube Premium) have stayed away from the process since its inception. Considering India has more than 35 online video streaming providers, the Code is not really representative of the entire industry’s position. So then why are we concerned if it is only being carried out by such a small number of players?

## Our Take: This is a precursor to self-censorship and for online streaming to go down the path of TV

Simply put it is the first step towards broad basing self-censorship as industry practice in India’s online video streaming space. If that is indeed the outcome, it would adversely impact internet users in India, creators, artists, production companies and so on. It is also likely to harm competition, innovation, investment and would facilitate industry capture by a few firms over the ecosystem.

The framework essentially builds on the original code of best practices through some key changes. First and most importantly, it seeks to establish an independent enforcement authority called the Digital Content Complaint Council (DCCC) to oversee a signatory’s content related practices. This DCCC mechanism is eerily similar and largely derivative of the [**Broadcast Content Complaints Council (BCCC)**](https://www.ibfindia.com/sites/default/files/Guidelines--Term%20of%20broadcas%20changes.pdf) (under the Indian Broadcasting Foundation) which essentially governs content on non-news and television channels in India.

We all know what that has meant to Indian television and how that has led to a largely homogenous content ecosystem, inundated by typical saas-bahu programming devoid of much creativity or pathos. Moreover, how often do we watch our favourite international content on TV and get bummed out that a large chunk of the programming has been edited out? In this context, the online video streaming space was a breadth of fresh air for Indian audiences who were fans of global and local storytelling. Further, it provided opportunities to local storytellers who had until then been rejected by traditional television, theatrical and radio media.

## The legal basis and policy need for this effort is questionable at best

In this context, it is disconcerting that even though there is no legal mechanism which empowers the DCCC, its ties with the Government are undeniable. The proposed DCCC is meant to be chaired by a retired High Court or Supreme Court judge. Also, the DCCC is designed to include three members from national level statutory commissions like the National Commission for Women (NCW), the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)  or the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). Its composition would also facilitate incumbent business capture as the DCCC is meant to include three industry representatives and two online curated content providers (likely to be signatories to the Code). Considering the opaque manner (with no public/stakeholder inputs) in which the Code has been developed, and the public facing impact such a privately designed framework can have-- the legal validity of this effort remains dubious at best.

Second, such codified structures essentially provide the Government a parallel avenue with little to no legal accountability to apply pressure on businesses to censor people’s views and beliefs. It erodes channels for dissent and satire-- and is arguably incompatible with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under the Constitution of India.

Third, like the previous code on best practices, the new code for self-regulation talks about “prohibited content”. What is particularly dangerous is that the newest draft has been modified in a manner which makes the grounds for censorship vaguer. This would afford the DCCC with more discretion to remove certain speech/content which would otherwise be legal under the Constitution of India and also applicable laws like the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  This is compounded by the fact that the DCCC does not envision membership of stakeholders from research, academia or free speech backgrounds, to act as a safeguard for people’s right to receive and impart information. Therefore, it may be concluded that this Code is merely a liability reduction initiative which is being pushed through at the cost of plurality, diversity and creativity-- all cornerstone’s of the right to free speech and expression.

## Our letter to IAMAI

In a [**letter dated 17th January, 2019**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LKE-1DkhtFY3ZWWXpRdnRuVEpwWmMzYW1kR21yejA3d2g0/view) we had previously written to the IAMAI voicing our objection to the initial Code for Best Practices. We argued it was a slippery slope which would act as a precursor towards self-censorship in the Indian online content space. Our beliefs are reinforced by the latest Code for Self-Regulation and we have [**sent a representation to the IAMAI**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b3eJQghsUwOJEYU1ri0ah2roO0BVSju0/view?usp=sharing) requesting them to roll back the effort. In addition, we have shared a copy with both the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB), to brief them with the issues of endorsing the framework.

8647,"Failure: No Take Backs 

""It is a great move. You just don't understand. Trust the government. It will be better. Give them a chance."" 

We all know what exactly I am talking about. I don't claim to be a political science studen, an IAS officer or anyone with a crazy set of qualifications. But I cannot help but realise that the biggest failure of this government wasn't their making bold moves, it was them taking big risks that they couldn't tak back or do damage control on.

If you remember reading Eragon, the worst spells are the ones that can take all your energy and kill you. Those that you cannot stop. Just ask Bron what he had to say.

We saw this for the first time with demonetisation. Not only did it fail becasue the rich and corrupt are still rich and corrupt, it also inconvenienced the fuck out of all of us. In fact, reports now claim that a good portion of fake notes in the market are Rs 2000 notes. 

And what about roll-backs, in taking out notes from the market and making people stand in line, not getting to be productive. In causing people to suffer with now cash in case of weddings and medical emergencies, the damage is unreparable. We now see the state of our economy as well. This is without me considering their refusal to take advice and feeback.

They did something similar with GST, put everyone into a crazy state of confusion. No feedback taken. ""BJP is making big steps"".

Now look at CAA and NRC. We see people in Assam with their nationality in question, while we see immigrants getting free citizenship. The communal tension they created too cannot be rolled back. The damage to those in captivity cannot be undone. Again, implemented without a trial time they just implemented. Now instead of trying to understand the perspective of those opposed, they call them anti-national and insist they will implement it no matter what happens.

Why is it that every decision they make puts the nation into turmoil?

Are big decisions just by default likely to create tension and unease? Maybe. But there is a difference between growing pains and putting your citizens through shit.

Let's look at another big decision.

The decision to make Mumbai a 24/7 city. They are going to start with a trial period, so nothing is set in stone. If it works out, it can be built on, if it doesn't work, they can go back to their old ways without any tension.

This way, any concerns can be monitored by people and we can see how it affects large and small business owners, public safety and everything else.

The same with Odd-Even. Yes it was inconvenient, but they chose to implement it on a trial basis. So worst case scenario, people can go back to their lives.

I want to re-iterate. It is not an issue of balsy decisions changing and shaking up the world. It is unrevokable mistakes fucking us all.",1581342469.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,1,22

This was supposed to help in division of power, wherein each arm, keeps the other two in check. With the advent of media, it became the voice of the people.

Right now, India doesn't have this separation of powers. Legislative and Executive power have been merged under the blanket term of 'Narendra Modi'. The SC is more in control of the ruling party, rather than the other way around.

And don't even get me started on the media houses. They have given in to capitalism and outrightly support a particular party. Censoring themselves.

Apart from that, we have ample proof that the election commission is not being the watchdog it was supposed to be, and plays the role of a passing bystander. 

With all this, it is suffice to say that India is no longer a democratic country. The largest democracy in the world is crumbling. 

My question is, what can be done about this? How do we change directions and move towards a country where healthy debate is encouraged and development is prioritized?

He was vehemently against that since, as per him, religion permits marriage between a biological male and female and no one else. I pointed out that his belief went against his stand for UCC and he stated that dharma is sacred and can't be tampered with. The irony was strong with him.

And sometimes a week

Even imaginary happenings

Ones of your own mind's convoluted contraptions

Will sustain it for decades together

You pride on reigning it in

But it's only after it has dealt its blows

It looks like your pet is more in control of you

Than the other way round

What will it ever take you to set your pet free

It will never survive this world

Without you to feed it

Then you will see that you are more than your pet

That the human lurking in you

Now hidden somewhere underneath

The whole wrath and froth

The burning eyes and flaring nostrils

And gnashing teeth

And smashing fists

And flailing arms

And scratching nails

And kicking heels

8767,"Need Advise regarding career as a UI designer (just design)A little bit of background, I have a masters degree in electronics and communication stream of engineering. Even though I have relatively good cgpa (8.9 or 9 i think, out of 10) (although my bachelors grade was bad, have backlogs), After Bachelors, did a programming course (software testing automation) and joined a service based company (only got manual testing tasks), due to my own lack of awareness and confidence (change from living with family to suddenly living alone in a big city was not handled by me properly, in hindsight, used to run home every chance i got) in all this chaos, i forgot about my probation requirements and kept doing shadow work, HR let me go after 8 months (the next day i received project credentials, but it was too late), this was a bit of a shock, so, for some reason, i declared i wanted to do m tech (now i think, seems like i just wanted to escape from being an adult for 2 more years), anyway, finished m tech with great reluctance (i had realized that i wasn't doing justice to my studies and i was extremely dissatisfied with the work i've put to earn the degree, didn't publish my thesis as quality was not upto mark and i felt like a fraud to publish in some paid journal, so instead i took the marks cut, still haven't collected my degree certificate out of shame, because despite having good teachers and highly qualified guide, i feel like i did them a disservice) where am i even going with this, sorry! (also forgot all the programming in those two years)

Meanwhile, i got to know about UI/UX designing, and my pupils just popped, even since as a kid i always had a pull towards the artistic but never dared to pursue out of fear of lacking approval from family, although i did have a history of doing graphic design and some photoshop gigs, learning about UI/UX just felt like the perfect thing to me, so i just jumped into it, 

unfortunately, for the idiot i am, i had spent all the money i saved from the 8 month job on m tech and a very low end laptop , i now lack the proper instrument to display my (very limited compared stuff on behance and dribbble) artistic talents to the highest capacity, But, THANK GOD FOR FIGMA! I basically learned figma and found an opportunity in a small new start up, i didn't even care that it was unpaid internship, and by second week i happen to show some work to the management, looking at the new UI of their product compared to old, they offered me job on spot, i said yes in excitement, but, didn't think about salary, which was less than half of my previous job, despite the advice of not to downgrade your pay in career i cared about none of it because i had somehow managed to get to do something i truly wanted.

But, this turned to stale quickly, because i thought i would be doing UI work (which there is a LOT of in their products) but i was keep getting request to do do print designs (even though i have no experience whatsoever) and after comparing what i gave them vs what they were getting from design consultants, they started increasing my workload, adding new thing and even after requesting that i really wanted to do UI since thats what they hired me for, no changes, instead i basically get handed over all design and branding work (I want to clarify that, i still love the work, i like designing those too and don't mind it, it only makes me hone my craft more),

This has made me spread myself way too thin and i feel extremely stressed out about handling this enormous responsibility of a whole company given my experience level, i been putting in almost 18 hours daily and am falling physically sick, i am really afraid, i really like doing this sort of work and i don't want to get sick of it by overdoing it, the amount of work and responsibility feels too much compared to the compensation and the fact that all the work is protected by strict ndas, so i can't even brag about getting credits for the effort i'm putting.

I feel suffocated and stressed out and even my family is unhappy about it and is telling me to find another job in a big company like before, their argument is if i can find job in a big company with the terrible grades i had in bachelors, that i should score easily with the grades of my masters, if i say what i am pursuing and what i studied is unrelated, they say so was the case in BE too, to be honest even i also feel like i should be trying for better opportunities.

But the thing is, my experience isn't even about 2 months and the only evidences of my work are some generic 30 foot long hoardings, and the actual few screens i have designed will take a very long time to reach production. I also feel like i might be kicking away the opportunity i basically got handed to me, at the same time the unbearable physical exhaustion and illness and the thought of the years it would take me to buy a proper laptop to make any real progress in terms of skill ( i know this sounds stupid, but trying to get machine learning work on my weak laptop was a big slap of reality and the when i opened raw files from a pro on phostoshop).

What to do, what to do, I AM SOO conflicted, Should i try to jump or should i endure ( i also decided to lose weight and this had ruined my routine too), my head is feels like its undergone thermonuclear equilibrium (exploding and imploding at the same time)

Here is what i want, regarding this I have some clarity, I am interested in UI design ( don't care about UX or development) , my further goal is to expand my skills towards UI -> video -> vfx -> video games -> movies /art direction, thats the kind of path i want to work towards (i am really scared being a nobody while looking at the works of those that are already doing or those with proper training and education in the field) but i really want to do this..

I really need some sound advice here (also, my parents want me to write banking and government exam, it makes practical sense, but i know for a fact i wont be happy with my life working in a bank or as a government clerk), so many things, don't know what to do, I'm almost 27, but i'm still a kid, i still think like one, and being an ""adult"" terrifies me. I badly need some advise on what to do, i don't want to screw up things right now..

1. I got matched with this girl, texted her but she never replied.
2. Got matched with this girl, chatted for a few days. Went from tinder to fb and then to whatsapp. We use to have decent conversation I cracked even used to crack some adult-ish (but decent) jokes in conversation. Everything was fine but I realized she was immature, she used to talk childish things so I didn't proceeded further But yeah, the experience was fine.
3. Matched with this girl, she didn't replied and unmatched me after 2 days.
4. Matched with a few more girls but they seemed to have attitude problem, would reply after a long time which is a big turn off (I'm not expecting super quick replies but everytime replies after a few hours is something I don't like)

Takeaways:

I saw that a lot of girls match with guys and never reply them. This happened with my friends as well and I find it weird, why would someone match and then just ignore?

Have a honest bio, most guys fake their bio, when you get match and talk she would know you are not the same person you claim to be.

Have amazingly clicked picture where you are wearing neat and fit cloths but at the same time don't upload pictures where you look completely different person.

Personally I feel Facebook/Instagram is way better than tinder. Facebook gives you friend recommendations, sent request to someone you feel is interesting and have mutual friends (Mutual friends increases trust) and be decent when you approach someone and no ""bob and vegna"" crap.

8808,"What are some of the Ancient Indian Philosophers who have dealt with important topics such as metaphysics, consciousness, logic and science?A quick google reveals works of Nyaya-Vaisheshika school that saw implementation in science, more specifically, atomism, Mīmāṃsā saw critical analysis and thinking, Yoga is, well Yoga - the union of mind and body and of course Advaita Vedanta that insist on spirituality and non-duality between beings and the divine.

Clearly, there is a lot to be learn in the Indian past, but the lack of a proper syllabus prevents me from even understanding where to start such a journey.

> Mīmāṃsā theorists decided that the evidence allegedly proving the existence of God was insufficient. They argue that there was no need to postulate a maker for the world, just as there was no need for an author to compose the Vedas or a God to validate the rituals.[69] Mīmāṃsā argues that the Gods named in the Vedas have no existence apart from the mantras that speak their names. To that regard, the power of the mantras is what is seen as the power of Gods.[70]

[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C4%ABm%C4%81%E1%B9%83s%C4%81#Atheism) interpretation of Atheism in the Mimamsa School of Indian Philosophy is very refreshing where one critically questions the existence of a ""God"", which is ironically often blindly believed today's modern times. 

Would anyone know how to begin and what kind of books to read in order to understand the different school of Indian Philosophy (and dive into one down the line)?

Thank You!

8830,"We need to raise awareness campaign against rampant casual self medication being done by Indians (especially old people)I have seen several people who carry out casual self medication. They buy popular pills or medicines without any doctor's approval and start taking them regularly. Pain pills, cough pills, etc, even if they don't need them. Many a times, they use their own half knowledge and self medicate their children too.

So many people don't finish their prescription course and save the leftover medicine to use / consume in future when they have similar symptoms (even if they have a different disease).

8839,"Tips on Selling a House in IndiaHi guys,

Typing out this post to hear some advice on how people have sold their house in India.

We have a resedential apartment in Pune in one of the best localities. (Baner - for people who know about the city) and have been trying to sell it for the past one year. The agent network has failed us, and the people that have shown real interest are the people who saw our property on NoBroker. However, nobody has shown the real intent to buy it - the discussion ends at ""We will let you know""

Can someone with experience in selling their property on what could be going wrong? What can we do further to get genuine buyers with real intent? We've posted our property on 99Acres and Magicbricks, and the only interest comes from brokers who were randomly searching for properties. We've had good experience with NoBrokers, but then again there is no final step of sealing the deal.

&#x200B;

Any advice on what further can done would help a lot. Thanks!",1581268880.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,8
