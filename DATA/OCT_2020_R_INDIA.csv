5,"Why does India export [buffalo] beef and import electronics???A byproduct of the milk industry, most of which is from buffaloes, are male buffaloes. Since male buffaloes are no longer used on farms, only a few are kept for breeding purposes and the majority are butchered as soon as they reach optimal size around 2 years of age. The meat thus obtained is then shipped off mostly to China via Vietnam. In return the money earned by these exports is used to purchase electronics and other high tech products from China. 

***Isn't this a most STUPID thing to do?***

Buffalo meat is probably among the most nutritious food that there is. Also, if cooked properly it can be among the most delicious food. The Indonesian dish, Rendang, made from buffalo meat, was vote the No. 1 most delicious dish of the World's 50 most delicious foods: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendang). 

So, isn't it better to feed buffalo meat to the local population, so that undernourishment is eliminated and vast numbers of Indians do not become physically and mentally stunted and instead grow to their full potential? 

Such a well nourished population can then create its own high tech products, instead of importing them at high margins from a hostile country.",1572457863.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,9,0

I usually score a match or two across Tinder/Bumble here in Delhi around once every week or two

I have noticed that when I travel, my matches go up like crazy, upto 10-15 within a day or so in the new city.

This time, after coming back from Bangkok, I learned that I got like 20 potential matches, that I can no longer swipe on, 'cuz Tinder no longer shows profile stacks from your previous location.


Now, Tinder Gold has 2 main advantages- it will allow me to view and swipe on said match, and also has a location changing feature, which will allow me to change my location and swipe anywhere in the world. And yes, the new location profile boosting feature does apply when you use it.


On the other hand, its 600 bucks for one month, and automatically renews the subscription at the end of the month unless you cancel it and reading through the TaC, cancelling sounds like a giant pain in the butt.

The dealer gave a quotation of 30K for car and 20K exchange bonus which I accepted. On delivery day after I transferred the complete amount the dealer started saying that since car is not mine or blood relation the bonus offer can not be availed. This was after the documents of old car were signed up. This was not communicated earlier. I have not taken delivery of the new car and asked for cancelling the booking. More on principle than having to pay more. The dealer is now threatening me to pay additional amount and take the new car. What are my options? Any help is appreciated.,1572453536.0,,,dark,4,14

351,"A guide to anti-particulate masksI live in Gurugram and it's that time of the year when the air's out to kill you. I see very few people using anti-particulate masks around me. Now, I don't know if that recklessness, ignorance, badassery or dumbassery, but I am going to build on a comment I made on an earlier post by /u/UndeniableDork and write a guide to buying an anti-particulate mask. Before I start, resistance or immunity to particulates or pollution isn't a thing. Don't be an unscientific dumbass. Protect yourself and educate people you care about.

Down below are the different categories of masks along with an example Amazon link for the class. I do not endorse any of these products. These are just masks I've used over the last four years living in NCR and I don't have any complaints regarding their effectiveness. All of these, besides the exceptions mentioned, have protected me from breathlessness, irritated throat and upper respiratory tract infection.

1. I see a lot of people using the green surgical masks that are used in hospitals. This **DOES NOT** protect you from particulates. It works for airborne germs and will protect you from that guy who'll sneeze in your face while commuting on metro, but it does little for pollution. Most of the anti-particulate masks listed below help with germs as well, but if you're in an elusive unpolluted town with job opportunities, you can just get these to protect yourself in flu season. Price: [Rs. 5 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Filtra-4-Ply-Loop-Surgical-Face/dp/B00IIIKZK6/)
2. The cheapest anti-particulate masks are disposable ones that are sold in sets of one, three, five or ten. I used 3M, Honeywell and Dettol and they are all fine. I'm partial towards 3M and Honeywell because they have been making these masks and selling them as industrial personal protective equipment for decades now. Also, 3M and Honeywell masks sell well among the residents of other polluted cities around the world. Price: [Rs. 13.5 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/), [Rs. 33.9 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004-Particulate-Respirator-White/dp/B0146DETH6/)
3. The next tier is disposable masks with exhalation valves. The exhalation valves prevent moisture buildup inside the mask keeping is less humid preventing it from getting warm and uncomfortable. 3M and Honeywell sell these masks as well. Depending on the time duration you'd like to wear them and the amount of physical exertion you're likely to undertake, you'll have to get a mask with a single exhalation valve or two exhalation valves. Price: [Rs. 37 per mask (80% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/3M-9004GV-Particulate-Respirator-Mask/dp/B01LF2QMRQ/), [Rs. 127.8 per mask (95% efficiency)](https://www.amazon.in/Honeywell-Pollution-Foldable-Exhalation-Valve/dp/B01I9PVOPW/)
4. Then, there are high performance masks like the ones sold at Decathlon. You'll need these if you're planning to jog or cycle in a gas chamber. They also have dual ~~purification~~ exhalation valves ~~which are the main filtration component in the mask~~. The mask itself is reusable, but the purification filter must be replaced when you feel the air flow is getting limited. They admit more air flow than the ones above and they'll let you get more oxygen into your lungs while also blocking out particulates. *I haven't tried these masks and I cannot vouch for their effectiveness.* Price: [Rs. 499 per mask (Mask + Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8398131_sport-mask-light-blue.html#/254-), [Rs. 149 per filter (Replacement Filter)](https://www.decathlon.in/p/8397813_sport-mask-light-filter.html)
5. The most expensive ones are pretty looking masks like Vogmask and Cambridge mask that are made of cloth on the outside with a particulate filter inside. They also come with one or two exhalation valves. Some of these can be hand-washed an reused, but not with a detergent. Please remember that detergent fumes are carcinogenic. There are also masks with replaceable filters like the Decathlon one above. Some of these masks come with additional features such as activated carbon filters. These masks generally claim 95-99% efficiency. Price: [Rs. 299 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/PureMe-Reusable-Pollution-Activated-Filters/dp/B07KXMHNL7/), [Rs. 449 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Tdas-Anti-pollutiion-dustproof-Washable-Reusable/dp/B07YCWT6JY/), [Rs. 499 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B07NC8DW9Z/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Dettol-Anti-Pollution-Cambridge-Newton/dp/B07JP8RBQ2/), [Rs. 2000 per mask](https://www.amazon.in/Vogmask-Noir-CV-N99-Large/dp/B01J6KOW62/)
6. Nasofilters are an indigenous (AFAIK) product that is a filter that sits at your nostrils rather than functioning as a mask. So far, I've heard mixed reviews about them. The issue is see with them is that they don't filter air that will enter your respiratory system through your mouth. [Rs. 33 per pair of Nasofilters](https://www.amazon.in/NANOCLEAN-GLOBAL-Nasofilters-Pack-Boxes/dp/B078X6YFC6/)

A mask is only as effective as its fit around your nose and mouth. Honeywell masks, in their product guides, have a good way to test the effectiveness of what your wearing. If your mask is sitting right, it will puff up a bit every time you exhale and collapse a bit every time you inhale.

EDIT: Some corrections regarding high-performance sports masks. If you're looking for a mask for a child or an infant, look for smaller sized masks since adult-sized masks do not fit their faces and can end up causing suffocation for them.

Get an air purifier for your bedroom. Sleep quality improves when the air around you isn't full of shit. If you're unwilling to spend money on an air purifier, you can buy a PM2.5 filter screen for your air-conditioner ([Rs. 350 for a pack of 2](https://www.amazon.in/3M-Non-Woven-Electrostatic-Purifying-Filter/dp/B06XY536LF/)).

TL;DR: Wear an anti-particulate mask, there's a mask for everyone whether you're a broke-ass student or someone who makes 1.6LPM.",1572457583.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,18,54

374,"A speech impaired autistic 16 y/o boy from Mumbai has been missing for the past 29 days. Is there anything we can do to help?On October 1st, Tarun Gupta got swept in a political rally from Colaba Market area, he then reached Flora Fountain and couldn't find his way home. Tarun's parents lodged a FIR on the same day, at CSTM Police Station.

Upon investigation, it was found that Tarun was at Panvel Railway Station for two days (October 2nd to 3rd). Annoyed by the kid asking for water every few hours, On Oct 3rd 1:30 AM, Panvel Railway Police officer Monu Singh Tomar, decided to get rid of him by boarding the poor boy on the luggage compartment of Tuthari Express, a Goa bound train. This was confirmed by the CCTV footage.

Tarun's parents and relatives reached Goa and searched for him in every station, but could not find him. 

The poor boy was seen at Sawantwadi Railway Station in CCTV footage, on October 3rd. He then boarded Dadar bound Janshatabdi Express (train number 12052) from Sawantwadi and is believed to be in Panvel-Dadar.

The family is taken out ads in print and digital media, Tarun's father Vinod Gupta even posted about this in this sub several times, but they still haven't found him.

Tarun Gupta, a speech impaired, autistic 16 year old kid, who usually doesn't leave his apartment alone is now hundreds of kilometers away from home alone, hungry and scared.

This happened because of a negligent piece of shit Monu Singh Tomar, a railway police officer.

29 days later, there is no word of the kid.

Is there anything r/india can do to help? Does anyone one of you have a contact in media who can shed light about this situation?

How about mass tweeting under a specific hashtag so we can get the authorities' attention? Would that help somehow?

520,"Is there any way to earn a decent living while working as farmer/silviculturist in Himachal Pradesh?I explored almost all the jobs in India and all of them gave me a feeling of ""meh this sucks"" because while doing such job you lose contact with nature.

Now nature is in madhya pradesh or maharashtra too but those regions are hot and humid for 6 months.

Becoming trek leader in Himachal for India hikes is not easy. I was once crossing a jugadu bridge for small river in Himachal. I felt dizzy and was about to fall. Plus mountaineering course requires you to be strong and climb mountains and be good with rope knots.

Becoming a school teacher... maybe yes. But then teaching kids sucks.

If I get a job of a story collector for a journalism company in which I talk to Indians in public transport and write things, it would be awesome. Can improve my english for this.

523,"Would like some help comparing and contrasting the US and Indian government for a term paperEdit: I am not looking to discuss which side of my prompt is what India should do, I’m just looking for help identifying differences between the US government and the Indian government, like the title of this post says. 

I am writing a term paper about liberal vs realist views for the development in India for my international relations class, and would like this subreddit's help. I was born in India, and was raised until i was 12 there, so my grasp on the government isnt the best. 

So my hope is the subreddit can help with the differences between the US government and the Indian government, as i want to give my professor a good frame of reference of what the indian government is, before going into my prompt.

The prompt for my essay is:

> Should India focus on the poor and reducing inequality, or should they focus on concentrating macro-economic growth and building the military? 

It was pointed out to me that the prompt seems loaded, and i agree, so below this is the full prompt:

> This essay will focus on strategic issues to be pursued by a developing nation, that is a powerhouse, in terms of potential and population. It will focus on a Liberal Vs. Realist point of view of where India should focus its development, and labor force. There is a large amount of inefficiency in the Indian government which is causing a fair amount of issues, including the marginalization of backward groups of the population. This essay will focus on one of the major factors, the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), which historically has had a lot more change on social issues, but has had its effects on change slow down a fair bit, as other factors have been introduced. Someone who follows liberalist ideas would say we should focus on fixing the efficiency issues for the sake of the marginalized, and start working with organizations like the United Nations, UNICEF, and civil society to push India into a position similar to a 1st world country. On top of that push, India should also focus on reducing inequality between the rich and the poor. A realist on the other hand, while pushing for similar things, like stimulating the economy and starting to stimulate its economic position to the point where other countries want to trade with us for both goods and services, would have completely different reasoning for it. They would want the economy to be a powerful, so that India can start focusing on faster economic growth and strengthening the Military, without as much concern for the process issues involved in improving grassroots administration, as long as the Indian economy and Military was powerful enough to protect itself from other threats around the world. 

My nana-ji just wrote a book on part of the issues im look at, and is helping me with this essay, but i want as many viewpoints on what is different between the US and Indian governments. [What Ails the IAS and why it fails to deliver: an insider’s view](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9353286484), Sorry its an amazon link, its not affiliated in any way, i just figured it was the best place to link to, apart from maybe Google?)

Edit: and if the flair should be switched to Politics, please PM me, and ill switch it.

TL:DR: I’m writing an essay and would like help Identifying differences between the US and the Indian government.",1572408907.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,4,4

i don't know how it will all go but i hope he winds it down some day. i am no intention of taking up his factory. i have a happy job at a good company. i don't want the stress of running my own thing.

i get this fear that if he faces some health issue and he is not able to work all of a sudden will i have to take up his factory? he usually takes loans from banks and contracts from clients and executes on them. like will the bank and his clients and employees come after me if he is unable to fulfil his duties because of ill health?

i am also worried about any labour laws that apply to his employees and we can't fire them etc.

I have suffered from low self confidence all my life. Bullying and relatives constantly asking when I am going to gain weight does wonders :P. I am not physically attractive(all attempts to fix that have failed) and I am extremely introverted. Not that I did not ever had chance to find a partner, but foolish teenage me fucked up by going after the attractive girls instead of the one's that actually liked me.

As far as arranged marriage is concerned, I am very much against it, having seen what that has done to some of my cousin's lives. While I could easily get someone to marry me because mostly money is what matters to people getting arrange marriage, and I have a high paying job. But in no way I am going to fuck up my own life, and more importantly, someone else's life just for sex.

At this point in life, I have found it to be in my best interest to just accept that relationships and/or sex is not something for me, and that loneliness will be an integral part of my life. It's better for my mental well being than thinking about how I could be with someone who likes me(or maybe not) and be having sex(or maybe not).

So whenever the topic of relationship comes up, I say that I am not interested in arranged marriage, and that I will find someone for myself (that's a lie. I am not even trying). Then my sibling suggests me to try Tinder / <put popular dating app here>. Everyone tells me how bad it would be for me to live alone, how I can easily find a partner through arranged marriage(because of my salary). They come with innovative new reasons every time, eg. how I would die alone when I get sick because I won't get medical help, and no one would find my dead body.

I just need them to realize that all this only ends up making me feel shitty/miserable. I spend the next few days regretting the life choices I made, feeling shitty about how much coward I have been. Then I start feeling bad about everything. Trying to watch a educational video? Trying to masturbate? Trying to read news? Browsing reddit? I should be dating instead. For few days, I am unable to do anything. And then this repeats.

There was a thread on a previous post here on r/india where a guy said that increasing minimum wage will push business owners to move their industry outside delhi. But Kejriwal has requested the owners to think in the long term.


Kejriwal said that increasing minimum wage will allow the poor to buy more goods which will increase production which will increase jobs (4:10 in video)

Then Kejriwal appealed to business owners that in short term these owners might think that their costs will increase, but in the medium and long term, their sales will also increase when the poor will buy more goods because of the increase in minimum wage.

I think it's our responsibility to explain the truth to them.When I told my mom how much good things he has done for women, she replied ""But my friends are saying that he is a lunatic. That he is wasting the tax money on free schemes""

Then I explained two things to her and she realized that she needs to avoid the gossips of her friends from now on. The two points were.

1 - I told her that free metro and bus rides for women will increase participation of women in the economy. The free rides will help women who are presently not able to go to job just because they have to beg for money or lift from their dominative husbands. I told her that the free ride scheme was for her and she needs to be thankful to Kejriwal.

2 - I told her that Delhi Government has lots of tax money that it can afford to give these free services. It's just the previous government spent it on their own greed. But this government is spending for the people. I told my mom that she had become used to dishonest politics and now honest politics is a huge shock for her. I told her that tax budget of delhi has doubled up and there is nothing to worry.

Please educate your boomer parents, millenials.

If you can not educate them yourselves, send them the links of the videos of Aam Aadmi Party channel on youtube or the content published on the app called ""Arvind Kejriwal"" on Playstore.

As it is quite a huge surgery with its own issues , I wanted to know if there was anyone else who'd become circumcised as a teen or an adult here. I'm a teen so its awkward to ask others in real life.

893,"What speed should I be driving my scooter at ?I was a NRI in the country I lived in it was a norm to drive at 100+ km/h on the street and a minimum of 80km/h.
When I used to visit India I noticed  people driving at 20km/h  the main reason I felt was the quality of roads and the scooters weren't that good in braking or the traffic.

Fast forward to a few years I moved to India the roads are almost as good as the ones in my country the scooters are really good in braking. But people haven't changed one bit they still drive at 20-30 kmph  even on empty roads.

I own an Ntorq and when I immediately bought it I was doing 75+kmph on one lane roads because I didn't have a grasp on how fast that is considered here I was a rash driver there too.

I slowly changed now I rarely go over 80 even on really good roads and usually cruise around 60kmph but my classmates still tell that I am a very rash driver.

I tried riding below 40 once but I couldn't concentrate on the road because it felt like riding a cycle.
 If I don't feel I am fast enough my mind wanders of to some other place and there are chances that I could get into an accident if I am riding at 60 kmph my scooter comes to a stop in 2 seconds but if I am riding at 40kmph I react at least 1 second later which makes the total time to stop the same.

I never speed in areas where people are likely to cross and above 60 I constantly look at both the extreme sides of the road to look out for dogs people don't jump in my area. 

I would also like to mention the other reason why I have to drive fast is because even people who drive at 30-40kmph reach their destination before me because they never follow the traffic rules break the signals speed at intersections don't slow down at gap in median or just go straight ahead without looking left or right.",1572326069.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,10

909,"Business/Data Analysts, how do I find a job at a top firm as a BA with 1 year of experience?I've been working as a Business Analyst (Business Intelligence and Analytics) at a startup for 1 year. Couple of employees, including me, were kind of let go because the company isn't doing financially well. This sucks because most of the job listings ask for 3+ years of experience, and it's proving to be hard to find a job with just 1 year of experience.

I've started applying for BA roles on Naukri and LinkedIn, but haven't had much luck. I realized that I need much more experience in working with Python and R as right now I'm just a beginner in these. Right now, I'm going through tutorials and trying to learn as much as possible about these tools.

Joining a top firm is the only way to learn and gain proficiency in the skills needed and have a fulfilling career going ahead. Ideally I'd prefer a full-time job, but I'm totally okay with an internship (3-6 months) as well where there's a facility to convert to full-time job after satisfactory performance during the internship.

I'm a B.Tech graduate from one of the 7 old IITs in case it matters. I can provide my resume as well through DMs. I'm in dire need to get back to work and can start working right away. I'd really appreciate any leads/references. Thanks.",1572346427.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,4,9

2. Our soldiers would want us to work hard in our jobs/businesses and increase the GDP and per capital income of the beautiful nation they are guarding. 

3. Our soldiers would want everyone in their country to not spit paan or throw cigarette butts on the roads and public spaces of the beautiful nation they are guarding. 

4. Our soldiers would want us to not bicker amongst ourselves in the name of caste, language, religion, state etc and maintain the integrity of the beautiful nation they are guarding. 

5. Our soldiers would want us to guard their families and kin in their absence while they guard our beautiful nation. They would want us to not support any mindless War Mongering by any sides because they have families too. They know their job well and have been doing it amazingly well. 

6. Our soldiers would want us to work hard to end poverty and improve world hunger rankings of the beautiful nation they are guarding. 

7. Our soldiers would want us to ensure that every child is educated and is safe from trafficking etc in this beautiful nation they are guarding. 

8. Our soldiers would want us to stop discussing rubbish time waste stuff about politics, religion etc and make our politicians, irrespective of their parties, accountable for better roads, infrastructure, hospitals, public transport projects, waterway projects, law enforcement etc. in their areas so that they know the beautiful nation they are guarding is progressing. 

9. Our soldiers would want us to behave at our best behaviour when we go abroad and on social media forums as we are representing  the beautiful nation they are guarding. 

10. Our soldiers would want us to be worthy of guarding. 

P.S.- I will always stand up for our national anthem but I'm sure our soldiers expect more than that from us and for us to focus on building a better nation that they can continue to be proud of guarding.

(Translation – “The land is ours, Ram is ours, where did the people with Masjid appear from?” Excuse the poor translation)

This certainly goes against NBSA guidelines on how to cover Ayodhya land dispute case. The NBSA strictly advises against speculating supreme court verdict or showing celebratory images of a particular side, calling panellists with extreme positions on the case. These guidelines have been brazenly flouted by almost all news channels.

Will immediately benefit 55 lakh workers.Delhi government had tried to raise the minimum wage in 2017 but this had been taken to court by a number of associations of employers. High Court ordered against the hike in 2018, which was then appealed to Supreme Court. 

Delhi government then constituted a Minimum Wage Advisory Committee in November 2018 that finalised the wages. This amounts to Rs14,842/month for unskilled workers, which was submitted before the Supreme Court. The SC has now accepted Delhi Government's proposal. 

Comparison with some other states:

> Delhi ₹14842

> Haryana ₹8827

> UP ₹5750

> Gujarat ₹8190

> Maharashtra ₹10411

> [National Minimum Wage](https://thewire.in/labour/delhi-minimum-wake-hike) ₹ 4,576 (recommended, but not implemented ₹9,750) 

Of course Delhi has a higher cost of living, but I can't imagine other cities like Lucknow being 3 times cheaper. Therefore other state governments also need to look at their wages and revise them. 


> A Bench of Justices U.U. Lalit and Aniruddha Bose, in an order passed on October 14, permitted the Delhi government to bring into effect its draft proposal to revise minimum wages of unskilled labourers to ₹14,842, ₹16,341 for semi-skilled, ₹17,991 for skilled workers, ₹16,341 for non-matriculates, ₹17,991 for matriculates who are not graduates and ₹19,572 for graduates and above.

> In an affidavit filed on August 26 this year, the Delhi government said it has proposed the revised minimum wages taking into consideration “the average prices of food items and clothing component and other prescribed percentage of other components i.e. housing, light & fuel and education/social obligation”.

2. Work/study hard and try for one of the BIG4 or any good product based companies.

3. Move abroad to USA/Canada for masters. Investing 25-30 lakhs seems reasonable for the returns, once (if) I get a job there.

4. MBA. Don't know what the fuss is all about but looks like there's good money involved.

PS: I'd rate myself as an average programmer. Not a programming wiz, not a robot either. Can solve most of the GeekForGeeks/DS/Algo questions. And if I'm stuck at anything at work, I'll figure out shit and find my way around it.

I am a 4th year student in a Tier-2 college in Kerala, India. A student of Electronics and Communication engineering. Although I know a bit of C, Java and Python, I lack advanced knowledge in all. 


So I recently got placed in a MNC (TCS) for the Ninja Profile (3.36lpa). I did attend interview for the Digital Profile (7lpa) but my lack of knowledge of ML and data structures didn't help. 

When I think of it, I'll be making a net income of only about 10k per month if i join. That won't help me in future savings.

Also i want to go abroad and if possible, study in a good university so that I can develop my skills. The only issue is that my family wouldn't be able to afford that. I do have over 8 CGPA currently. 

So,

1. What are my chances at TCS and how much growth will I be able to attain?

2. Any good foreign university that is affordable (M.Ba?) 

3. Or any other company I have a shot at?",1572269075.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,6

1171,"Read Politics before you ask politics!Last month, I moved to Mumbai for my new job as a Digital marketing manager and side by side, I'm hustling running a service that reviews and promotes books of self-published authors.

Getting bored of the job and having nothing much to do, I decided to start a YouTube channel where I'm gonna ask random people random stuff.

I've done this kind of stuff in the past and I know what it takes to make such videos (you can watch one [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHsPYVuhaW0)). Though until now, I've only talked about books but I'm confident to talk about anything else too.

So, I went to Marine drive last week and after vacillating a lot amongst infinite options, I chose '***politics***'.

My fear was that I don't know much about Politics and if someone argues about something, I won't be able to counteract that but my friends insisted on doing that only.

I then started asking people about what do they think of our govt. (which is right now BJP). Most of them denied to answer and the ones that did, are either from left-wing or right-wing. So, I met an uncle who was 80+. He was totally against BJP & RSS, and he talked to me about that for a while. He said that BJP & RSS are utilizing the term 'Hindutva' in the wrong way and people have started to disparage the other religions indeed.

It's him who said that and not knowing much about politics (as mentioned above), I then asked a person the same thing that uncle said to me like how other religions are being disparaged and BAMM!!!

In a minute or two, I was encircled by 4-5 men who were castigating me for my thoughts. I then told them that I don't know much politics and it's just someone told me this, so I linked it to my question and asked you.

They were all praising RSS's work and in that came a topic of Subhas Chandra Bose. Someone said that he was the leader of RSS, to which I replied that no, he wasn't. In fact, he was against the RSS. And that's when things got bad!

I heard them castigating me for maligning the religion and I was on the verge of cry.

I literally touched everyone's feet and said sorry.

Since that day, I'm reading politics for most of my day. I've decided that I'm not gonna do any such thing again in the future but for sure gonna have knowledge of politics.

Also, I did read about [Subhash Chandra Bose](https://www.booxoul.com/top-7-books-on-subhash-chandra-bose/), and he was against RSS.

See, I don't understand politics. Like how minds of people work. Like how fragile it is to talk about religion.

My order was dispatched in 2 days using Gati (even though the product page said Amazon Delivered within 3-5 days), and then I stopped seeing any updates on the tracking page. The estimated delivery date said 22nd October.
At the end of day on 22nd October, I called Amazon support, and instead of explaining where my order was, they just updated the status to ""Delivery Delayed upon customer request..."", even though I was dying to have it delivered ASAP.
Since then, I have called Amazon multiple times asking about my order. Each time, the rep from the ""Large Appliances"" team tells me they have `escalated` the issue and I should wait for 24-48 hours, but the product hasn't showed up yet.  
A few days ago (Friday), Gati called and blatantly said that I should carry the fridge from their location because they didn't have men, or I could wait till Saturday. I called Amazon again and mentioned this, and again the CSR ""escalated"" my issue and promised that this time he had raised the issue to some urgent team and I would definitely receive my product on Monday. because Sunday was a holiday etc.  
On Monday (28th Oct), Gati called again and said I should collect it from them. I called Amazon again, and once more the CSR said they have ""escalated"" the issue and I will definitely get it within 24-48 hours.

1. Both are mostly vast plains most of which is very fertile and supports agriculture.

2. This allows for various societies to spring up across the entirety of the region from a common base but evolving into distinct identities. Both India and Europe are multicultural entities.

3. From a broad religious perspective, both India and Europe are to a very large degree homogenous, India happens to be dominated by Dharmic faiths while Europe is dominated by Christianity.

4. Both India and Europe have been usually politically fragmented and only briefly ever politically unified (or even culturally dominated by one stately entity). For example: Romans in Europe and the Mauryas in India.

As I can see from the above points India and Europe share some very similar geographical, historical, and cultural conditions. Are there any more similarities?

It has an exceptionally complicated variant list and I'm confused between the two engine options on offer.

**1.4L turbocharged petrol engine:**
-
Max Torque: 242 Nm @ 1500-3200 RPM

Max Power: 138 Bhp @ 6000 RPM

Fuel Economy: 16.1 kmpl

**1.5L turbocharged diesel engine:**
-
Max Torque: 250 Nm @ 1500-2750 RPM

Max Power: 115 Nm @ 4000 RPM

Fuel Economy: 20 kmpl

I have generally been a fan of diesel engines because of the low-end torque it offers and the higher fuel economy. But this 1.4L turbo-petrol puts out numbers which are compelling.

Well, it's not about the girl but I wanted to feel a bit inclusive and expose myself to the events that this city has to offer as I literally dulled my mind by being an introvert. I know I am full of good things and if not great skills with a liking towards public speaking, debate and discussion.  I want to hone what I have.

KIIT National Youth Parliament Competition is going to be held on 16th and 17th of November

[https://www.lawctopus.com/kiit-national-youth-parliament-competition/](https://www.lawctopus.com/kiit-national-youth-parliament-competition/) (link if you are interested)

I was selected and was allotted the portfolio of Digvijay Singh in AIPPM.

I know nothing about politics with my last affiliation with politics was when I was in 10th grade(still a bit skeptic about the grade). I've been taking a bit interest in politics as I am growing up and it'll most probably affect my life to a certain extent but still my knowledge is nowhere near what is considered as basic for a common man .

While simultaneously asking for help, I would also do my diligence and search about the aforementioned competition

I need help regarding how to start this or a general direction and I also want to improve my English and public speaking skills.

Working towards this would certainly give me knowledge,experience and most definitely boost my morale and confidence .

I thank you all for helping me or even taking time to read it.

Thank You.",1572235015.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,5

Spending most of your childhood and early adulthood studying and training to land a middling job in a company is what is defined as success today. People want security and stability - something these companies seem to promise. Yet, there have been an incredible number of stories about people getting laid off for no other reason than the company hit a rough patch for once in several years. 

&#x200B;

And then there are startups, the latest in a list of Ponzi schemes designed to drain the finance out of people looking to make money. With scumbag CEOs who are able to raise funding based off of their networks from ivy league colleges (that their daddy paid a dear amount to get them into), who have absolutely no business acumen, giving themselves salaries in millions of dollars, while the wide eyed, naive poor people or immigrants who have worked hard their entire lives in the hopes of bettering their lifestyles struggle to pay rent till they are laid off, what are we even doing here?

My husband and I had a love marriage 7 years ago. We've stayed apart mostly because of my transferable job, but we have 2 kids.

When i was pregnant with my second child a couple of years ago, I felt he wasn't taking care of me during the horrible first trimester, so I came home to my mom's to get better. I thought he would apologise and would make some changes to his health and lifestyle (he's obese, eats out most days and doesn't exercise). We have always had a problem with cooking where neither likes to cook, and we had a cook for most of our time together. He's also had a problem with alcohol, where he zones out after 2 drinks and doesn't remember how much he's drinking. he's also used to drinking at least once in 2 days - it's always been a sore point for us, especially after the first child came along.

Two months ago, husband (37 years old) had a brain stroke and had to get 2 stents in his right brain. He and his parents are in denial that it is due to his eating and exercise habits. Their version is that his wife left him to fend for himself and caused him to undergo tremendous stress, causing the stroke to happen.

One month after the stroke, he left for his parents' house to recuperate. He said I wouldn't be able to give him the care that he needed. I told him the children needed him too, but he wanted to go to his mom and dad. 10 days after going there, he called me up and said he wanted Rs. 15 lakh for his brother who was setting up a retail outlet. Our combined savings are at around Rs. 95 lakh, all in equity and MF instruments. I was aghast and said that we should give about Rs. 5 Lakh and give out the rest in smaller chunks.

He's taken offence to it and now has asked me to transfer his entire money into his personal accounts (these are in my investment accounts as of now - i asked him multiple times to get on these accounts but he never got KYCed). His total contribution to our family fund is around Rs. 55 lakh. He's liquidating all the mutual funds, saying he will reinvest for the good of the children as per his terms and conditions.

Is there a way I can salvage this? His family refuses to talk to me or my family, thinking that I'm the villain here. Am i the villain?

I would really appreciate some advice from the community.

Update: he withdrew 14 lakh within a matter of minutes yesterday from the Mutual Funds, most of which were allocated for the children's college education (we were planning to send them abroad for graduation).

I finally came to a breaking point and transferred the balance by giving him all 'my' emergency funds and borrowing 3 lakhs from my aunt. If I wouldn't have done this, he would have withdrawn another 13 lakhs from the college fund. I couldn't bear to see my children's future decimated like this. He on the other hand, feels it was minimal damage and he will reinvest as per what he feels right.

Update2: he doesn't have experience in investing, so he relied on me to do it. He hasn't shared any plans with me on how he intends to invest the money. He also did not say outright that my investment decisions were bad ones. He basically gave no reason for withdrawing from the college fund, except that he should have the money in his account.",1572258682.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,18,13

Anyways,I'm regretting it a lot, eventhough it happened like long time ago. I lost all my friends from previous school. I became extremely lonely and got depression and anxiety.i was bullied alot,i mean a lot,even sexually harassed at some point. I wish I didn't change school.

My big concern however is that I missed the chance of the privilege of studied in an ICSE syllabus school rather than a shitty school.

Few days back I have got message that Panvel Nanded train no. 17613 has been partially cancelled and I have to take train from Pune instead of Panvel.

So please help me if anyone knows how can I get exact information. If running from pune the train will depart at 7:40 pm. Should I leave for Pune or cancel the trip.

[Update]: it was a total shitshow. The train was cancelled and I could only find this out when a mutual friend visited Pune station. I could still see the train on all those websites even on Indian railways official sites, shows train has left Pune an hour late and running. But actually my ticket says its cancelled.

Both of our families are typical middle class Hindu families from small towns. We met at my previous workplace, it just started off casually and things clicked very well between us. In the beginning, I thought the language and the cultural differences wouldn't matter much in the long term since we're very comfortable conversing in English, confident of learning each other's languages to be able to hold everyday conversations and also given the proximity of our states, cultural differences aren't too many. Once we revealed it to the parents, both of our sides were initially reluctant but didn't oppose in a strong way. But as the time passed on, they kept coming up with every little problem, like we can't mingle well with each other's relatives, both our families can't interact, there will be lots of differences and problems created in the long term which may seem small now, but would matter later. They keep warning us that we may not be happy and making a mistake, why do we have to go through all this with the problems and compromises right from the beginning when they can find someone as good from our own state and community. Although we're strong with our decision, my gf is starting to get little apprehensive of the potential problems in the long term.

1431,"Book review: I too had a Dream:An Autobiography -Verghese KurienVarghese  Kurien is a professional bad-ass. He was as Mallu as anyone could ever  be — an opportunistic self serving hot-head who jumped at the sight of a  government job which guaranteed to take him abroad. Once this came to  be he tried his best to scoot away from the contractual agreement for,  the job he was offered post-foreign studies was, according to him,boring  and underpaid.A farm in India is no place for somebody with a physics  degree from a western university.The authorities didn’t take his  rationale too kindly placed him on the wrong end of the gun and  threatened to sue him and so he had no choice but to go to Anand,Rural  Gujarat amidst a group of farmers. The rest is history.

Kurien  figures out the structural infirmities that was resulting in low  efficient milk production. One by one he moves on to fix these, what  makes him different is that instead of waiting around for kindness from  the government coffers, he encourages Farmers led by an awe inspiring  Tribhuvandas Patel to set things in order and skyrocket milk production.

‘Anand  Model’ became a thing- why wouldn't it? The cooperative was contesting  directly against industry leader Nestle. The guy busted the then  prevailing myth that curd couldn't be made from buffalo milk. What  follows in Varghese Kurien’s life is an avalanche effect — *the more he succeeded, more doors opened to him.*One  of the key points in his success story is how he was invited by Chief  Minsters of other states, and even the leadership of Pakistan to  replicate the success at Anand. Anand Milk Union Limited *aka* ***AMUL*** soon had its unique marketing campaign, a movie of its own [*Manthan,(you can watch it here*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=91qliAxU1pA&t=953s)*).*

What  was the secret of Kurien’s success? for one thing he was at the right  place during the right point of time.When reading the book, what one  learns is that most of the problems in Indian agriculture was a result  of lack of adequate leadership. Though Kurien addressed himself as a  servant of the country and of the farmers of Anand, he had total power.  This was power he acquired as a result of his competence in his field of  work. It seemed that Kurien was unchallenged.Even people whom he  managed to pissed off seemed to like him.This is visible in the case of  Kurien’s relationship with Guruji Golwalkar. Kurien thought the man was  crazy and the book tells of incidents where Kurien joyfully acted out in  attempts to annoy the Sarsangh Chalak. But on his deathbed, Golwalkar  sends a disciple to Kurien to wish him all the best. This action  acquires a divinity when you realize that it happened in the per-virtue  signalling era.

Another  interesting aspect of this book is the small nuances it pluck off  Indian Personalities. For instance Dr Kurien was one of those rare  people of the non political class of India who could ring up the PM ,be  it Rajeev Gandhi, or Indira Gandhi or Nehru on ther personal line, and  talk to them and get things done. There is an instance where he calls up  the PM and asks him to call a halt on milk imports in India. And there  was a time when the Agriculture and Finance minsters granted him total  freedom to use everything in their power to get things straightened up.  The political class really looked up to this man, and that spoke a lot.  Probably the only other Indian who commanded so much respect from them  was Mr Kurien’s contemporary - Vikram Sarabhai. Those were marvellous  times in Indian History.

The  book reaffirms the reader, that India isn't as shitty a place as the  news media portray it to be. Though not as fast, things are really  changing, and what we need are prime movers like Varghese Kurien to  carry the country forward. Recommended reading for anyone interested in  Indian History.",1572256385.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,4,47

Although, he still doesn't see a viable alternative to Narendra Modi as the PM, he also started to acknowledge that Kejriwal is doing in his own words, ""some good things in Delhi that media isn't reporting""

Don't lose hope if you are facing the same situation at home. Keep on making the rational arguments and tell them the facts. You'll get through. If anyone can change the minds of your parents, it's you.

Can I call the police to arrest these kids or their parents for violating the law and increasing the noise pollution? It is getting on my nerves.

1614,"What are some easy and interesting things you can get with money in India?Happy Diwali everyone. End of month is coming and salary comes with it. I'm not spending anything at all except for my regular learning (courses and stuff). I should buy some clothes though. But what else have you bought with money that was really interesting that not many people know of or think it could be expensive but it really isn't? I've thought about investing but I don't know a single thing about it, so I haven't gone that route yet but am willing to look into it. 

(Provide me with anything where I can learn about investing, if you have any. Mind you, I'm really not that good with understanding finance related stuff.)

1616,"Delivery boy made mistake. I asked him for a total refund.

Through an Android App, I orderd items worth Rs 800 from Dominos to a friend in Delhi.

Friend recieves and 5 minutes later tells me the items were not what she ordered. They were like worth Rs 400

I call the delivery boy and he tells me he made a mistake. In a case of negligence, he gave A's box to B and B' box to A.

The delivery boy said to me on call in hindi

""Bro, please forgive me, I am a poor guy. People celebrate diwali with an extra earning whereas I will give up my earnings back to you from my own pocket just for this punishment. Let it go, do not take this refund back""

I took 5 seconds to think whether I should give him the freedom or should I just grab my money back. I said to him in hindi

""No bro, you made a mistake and you will have to pay back. My friend to whom you gave the wrong order is very angry now. Give me the refund.""

He said ""Okay sir, as you wish""

Then disconnected. At this time I felt like he will send some goons and thugs to throw stones at my house lmao. Which is possible.

But I just want to know what you all think of this as there is a guilt inside me. 


Option A - If I refuse the refund, I will incur loss of Rs 400 in pizza terms. The guy will be in no loss. The dudes who took my pizza will get profit of Rs 400 in pizza terms.

Option B - But if I accept, I will get money profit of Rs 800. The delivery guy will suffer loss of Rs 800. The dude who took my pizza still enjoyed Rs 400 pizza terms.",1572205491.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,12,5

1633,"So Flipkart just scammed me.. I know Flipkart is a great shopping site and all, they give a lot of never before seen offers and stuff. But they just did a number on me with the Gamezone. 
 
 I usually play games in the Flipkart Gamezone, which is really rewarding if you can complete the game in time. I have recieved some rewards from it too. The rewards take some time to reach you, like one month or so.
 
 So recently I won an Itek Powerbank from the game (just won in the game, with the alert that I can claim the reward before October 4th. So I waited. At somewhere like September 30th, I was unable to play any Flipkart games. When I open the game section I just get a message that 'We encourage fair play in line with our terms and conditions'. I have never been able to play any game ever since. 

http://imgur.com/a/IEzgZMY

  I tried the customer service which was of no use. They just said that I am unable to play and was not provided any reason as to why it happened. When I called the customer care, they just cut the call after putting me on hold for sometime.
 
 Well what more can I conclude than Flipkart just scammed me big time? They do have a statement in their Terms and Condition that say they can block me from Gamezone anytime.


Why do they even give so much offers if they can't actually manage to give them? Nicely done Flipkart.

Edit: Please don't take me as a kid who is whining to get free stuff. I don't care very much about that too. It's just that they simply blocked me from doing something that they so blatantly advertised.",1572168761.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,7,8

1684,"[NP] My Scariest Diwali Was 12 Years Ago | And that experience still scares meWe had recently shifted to our new home, it was my parents decision to shift due to financial reasons and I was too small to have any say in it. I loved our old house as all my friends lived nearby that place. Here I knew nobody and I did not even see anybody my age after almost a month of living there. My elder brother, who was 14 at that time, did not mind it so much because he could ride to our old place on his bicycle within an hour. But I was not allowed to go anywhere outside 5 minutes of walking distance. It sucked big time and I was not looking forward to having a diwali without friends. But my parents had promised me they will take me to our old neighbourhood on Diwali night so that I could celebrate with my friends.

But fate had other plans. Surinder uncle, my mom's sister's husband had been admitted in a hospital since the last few days. That whole year he had been suffering from some terrible condition, I was too young to understand that he had blood cancer, my parents never used that term in front of me, I just knew that his pain was extreme and I used to feel very bad for him. On Diwali morning we got a phone call from his family that it could be the last day of his life. There was a lot of crying on my mom's part and I was too shocked to see this happening on a festival day. Life had never been like that before, I think it was the first time in my life that I tasted the feeling of complete despair. I cried too much with my mom that day.

It was decided that mom and dad will leave for the hospital in the afternoon while my brother and I had to spend diwali all alone at home. My mom promised me that she will try her best to come back before too late and take me to my friends if there was still time, but I knew even then that she was only lying to comfort me and it was not going to happen. I was prepared for the most depressing diwali of my life but I did not yet know all that I was in for.

Soon after they left, my brother told me that he was going out to meet his friends. I tried to stop him but he became very angry and pushed me away with a force making me hit my head against a wall. I'm sure he did not intend to hurt me like that but I felt extreme pain and started crying loudly. He was shocked and impatiently tried to console me and promised that he will make it up for me (he never did) and then threatened me to keep quiet and not tell our parents anything about it because he was supposed to look after me in their absence. Then that asshole went out leaving me sobbing in our new house all alone by myself. Happy diwali to me.

In the hours that followed I had listened to all my favourite songs on full volume, had eaten a lot of food and sweets that mom had left for us, watched my favorite shows on TV and was now reading my favourite Tintin comics in bed. I remember that it was titled The Black Island, and I was enjoying every panel by focusing on the little details and imagining all the scenes in my head. The time must have been around 8pm then and my brother was not yet back and neither were my parents. Mom had told me that if they didn't come back by 9pm I should not wait for them but prepare for bed and go to sleep without waiting for them.

The doorbell rang while I was still reading the comic, I thought it must be my brother so I went to open it without being prepared to see a full grown man standing outside in the dark. I told him that nobody is at home but he confidently came inside quietly as if he belonged there while I just stood aside. When he stepped into the living room I realised that it was Surinder uncle and I was happy to see him. I asked him dutifully if he wanted a glass of water to drink, as my mother had taught me to ask all visitors, but he declined. He asked me to sit with him so I sat down next to him on the sofa.

He was wearing a black jacket and looking healthy. It confused me because mom had been crying over him the whole morning and here he was sitting with me while my parents were at the hospital looking after him. Wait! I suddenly felt perplexed and some kind of fear quickly took over me. A sinister feeling crept all over my body making my hair stand on end. I will never forget that feeling of creepiness as long as I live. It still gives me shivers to think about it.

I gathered all my courage to ask him about his health, whether he was feeling well. That was a big mistake I soon realised. Instead of answering me he opened his jacket and put it away. He was not wearing any shirt inside it, there was no hair on his body and his skin was completely covered in dark purple veins with bruise marks all over him. Have a look yourself, he said. I was filled with disgust when I saw that most of his skin looked rotten and a strong nauseating odour was coming out of his body. My stomach jumped and I choked with vomit in my throat. I was getting up in a hurry when he grabbed me by the hand and told me to stay there with him, I was helpless and fell back on the sofa. He force hugged me tightly and told me repeatedly that he loves me while kissing me over my face.

I was thoroughly repulsed and I did not want any of his love, I just wanted to get away from him and vomit out my stomach's contents. I was terrified beyond belief and I could have fainted right there when suddenly I saw a very bright light descending from the ceiling of my room. That strange light was making the whole room vibrate with its energy. I felt the vibrations all over my body and inside my head. It is difficult to explain but I felt like how a cellphone must feel (if it had feelings) when it receives a call on vibration mode uncontrollably. It was extremely unpleasant and I wanted to scream at the top of my lungs but I was unable to no matter how desperately I tried. I was paralysed and unable to move or speak. The light was pulling everything in the room towards it. My head was spinning and the whole room was shaking and getting enveloped by that extreme white light.

And then nothing remained except complete whiteness, it was inside my head and outside it too, every neuron of my body was shaking. I was still paralysed when I lost my consciousness. I woke up on my bed just after 9.30pm by the ringing of the doorbell. I was too scared to open the door. I was hesitantly standing behind it when my brother shouted from outside and I opened to him with relief. He was also very scared when I told him what had happened and he asked me to not tell our parents about it. They did not return that night anyway. I learned next day that Surinder uncle had died the previous night and I feel that he had come to pay me a visit before leaving this earth because he loved me.

Last year I told some close friends about this experience and one of them told me I must have experienced sleep paralysis. I don't know what it was but I still get nightmares sometimes in which I revisit that scene for brief moments of traumatising hell. It is absolute torture for me to even think about that diwali, but I have written this as a therapy to console myself today.

Thank you for reading. Please let me know your thoughts and opinions about this. Do you think that spirits exist? Do dead people visit their loved ones in spirit form before they leave this world? Is there an afterlife? Have you or anybody you know experienced anything like this?

I never really celebrated diwali after that day and I'm looking forward to a quiet time by myself tonight. Happy diwali.",1572180400.0,,Non-Political,dark,43,85

It's very long but here are the portions that stuck out to me:

#His role in the 2002 riots

That same night, Ehsan Jafri, a 72-year-old former MP for Ahmedabad, called his granddaughter Anika in Surat with some disappointing news. Ensconced in his home in Gulburg Society, a mostly Muslim upper-middle class neighbourhood in Ahmedabad, Jafri, a veteran Congress politician, already sensed it would be risky to attempt a journey to Surat the next day. On the phone, he told Anika he wouldn’t be able to come. “But it’s just a shutdown, and he should make it,” she protested to her mother.

At around noon on 28 February, Anika called her grandfather again. “Have you not started?” she asked him. “Beta, the situation is not good here,” Jafri answered. “There are mobs everywhere.” He told her he needed to put the phone down, since he had a lot of calls to make.

A huge mob had already gathered around Gulburg Society, armed with petrol bombs, cycle chains and swords, shouting slogans like “Take revenge and slaughter the Muslims.” Many of Jafri’s neighbours, as well as Muslims from neighbouring slums, had come to his house seeking safety, expecting that his status as a former member of Parliament would afford them protection. “He must have made over a hundred phone calls for help,” Jafri’s wife, Zakia, told me. He called the Gujarat director-general of police, the Ahmedabad police commissioner, the state chief secretary and dozens of others, pleading for their intercession. A witness who survived the carnage later told a court that Jafri even called Narendra Modi: “When I asked him what Modi said, [Jafri] said there was no question of help, instead he got abuses.” Word of Jafri’s frantic calls for help even reached Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani in Delhi: a BJP insider close to Modi, who was with Advani on 28 February, told me that the BJP leader had even called Modi’s office himself to ask about Jafri.

By 2:30 pm, the mobs had broken through the gates of the housing society, and a flood of men converged on Jafri’s home. Women were raped and then burned alive; men were made to shout “Jai Shri Ram”, and then cut to pieces; children were not spared. According to records later submitted in court, Jafri was stripped and paraded naked before the attackers cut off his fingers and legs and dragged his body into a burning pyre. The official police report indicates that 59 people were murdered in Gulburg Society, though independent inquiries put the number at 69 or 70. Jafri’s wife, Zakia, and a few others who had locked themselves in an upstairs room survived.

To this day, Modi maintains that he had no knowledge of the events at Gulburg Society until he was briefed by police officers later that evening. But Sanjiv Bhatt, who was then the state deputy commissioner (Intelligence), says that Modi is lying. (Modi and his administration have vigorously contested Bhatt’s account, as well as the testimony given by several other police and government officials.) Bhatt insists that Modi, who also served as home minister, was in regular contact with the senior police and intelligence leadership throughout the day, and well-informed of events on the ground. Bhatt told me that he spoke with Modi over the phone several times before 2 pm, and reported that a mob had circled Gulburg, and that he met Modi at his office in the afternoon to report that the situation demanded immediate intervention.

“His response was very strange,” Bhatt told me. “He listened and then said, ‘Sanjiv, try to find out if in the past Jafri has been in the habit of opening fire.’”

“Outside the chief minister’s office, in the corridor, I bumped into the former chief minister Amarsinh Choudhary and former home minister Naresh Rawal,” Bhatt continued, referring to two Congress leaders. “Naresh Rawal was my minister earlier, so we talked. They told me Gulburg Ehsanbhai has been giving frantic calls, and they came to meet Modi. I said I had briefed the CM, but you also go and tell him,” Bhatt told me.

“I then got a call on my cellphone from my informer on the site at Gulburg,” Bhatt continued, “telling me that Jafri had opened fire. I was surprised. And when I reached my office, a short report was lying on the table saying Jafri opened fire in self-defence. That was when I realised that this man [Modi] knows things even before I came to know of things.”


#His interactions with businessmen

Modi was joined on stage by the heads of two venerable business families, Jamshyd Godrej and Rahul Bajaj, as well as the director-general of the CII, Tarun Das. If Modi expected a friendly welcome from Godrej and Bajaj, he did not get it. After recounting an incident from the previous month in Mumbai, when an Oxford University professor had heckled Modi at a public event meant to celebrate his election, Godrej called on Modi to use the mandate from his victory to ensure the safety and security of all Gujaratis.

Bajaj was even more outspoken: he began by declaring that 2002 had been a “lost year” for Gujarat. Looking at Modi, he asked, “Why don’t we get investment in Kashmir, the Northeast, or Uttar Pradesh and Bihar? It is not just the lack of infrastructure, but also the sense of insecurity. I hope this won’t happen in Gujarat—all this comes to mind because of the unfortunate events last year.”

Bajaj turned once again to Modi: “We would like to know what you believe in, what you stand for, because leadership is important,” he said. “You are today the undisputed leader of your party and government in Gujarat and we want to know you better …We are prepared to work with governments of all hues, but we also have our own views on what is good for our society and what works for it.”

Modi listened patiently to the torrent of criticism, silent but furious.

“You and your pseudo-secular friends,” Modi roared at the leaders of Indian industry, “can come to Gujarat if you want an answer. Talk to my people. Gujarat is the most peaceful state in the country.” Tension filled the room. Modi continued, turning to Godrej and Bajaj: “Others have vested interest in maligning Gujarat. What is your interest?”

Modi carried his fury back to Gujarat, and quickly set about showing the CII who really had the upper hand. Within a few days, a group of Gujarati businessmen close to Modi—including Gautam Adani of Adani Group, Indravadan Modi of Cadila Pharmaceuticals, Karsan Patel of Nirma Group, and Anil Bakeri of Bakeri Engineers—had established a rival organisation, which they called the Resurgent Group of Gujarat (RGG), all of whose members threatened to withdraw from the CII on the grounds that it had humiliated and insulted Modi and all Gujaratis. The RGG issued a press statement swearing by the pride of Gujaratis, and demanded that the Gujarat chapter of the CII resign for “failing to protect the interests of the state”.

Faced with an open revolt from a crucial state and its powerful business community, Tarun Das had good reason to worry: more than 100 companies from Gujarat were threatening to leave the CII, which would cripple the organisation’s presence in Western India; back in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government began to limit the CII’s access to its ministers, jeopardising the group’s core mission as a lobbying organisation.

Das reached out to the BJP leader Arun Jaitley, then the Union law minister and a close friend of Modi, seeking to make amends. Over a two-hour conversation at his house, Jaitley quizzed Das on the CII and its intentions, and then told Das that he would raise the issue with Modi, who was expected to come home for dinner one day soon.

A few days later, Jaitley told Das that the issue could be resolved: Modi wanted a formal apology from the CII. Das was eager to oblige, though not without some hesitation, as he later recounted in a long post-retirement interview with Business Today:

“The evening I was leaving to meet Modi [to deliver the letter of apology], my wife accosted me, ‘You just can’t do this….’ Among our close friends are Anu Aga, Azim Premji, Jamshyd Godrej and several from the Parsi and Muslim communities. My answer was that I had two options: I could quit and say I will not do this. Else, I had to look after our members.”

#His Days at the RSS

The pracharak related an incident that took place during the Emergency: “We in the ABVP were told to organise agitations against the government, from neighbourhood to neighbourhood, and one day we were holding a meeting at the Bhullabhai Char Rasta in Ahmedabad,” he said. “We were supposed to speak against the government, but in a sober tone, because that was the Sangh style, and also the police and the intelligence agencies were watching over us. But while the meeting was on, Narendrabhai passed by on a cycle. He was furious at the composed serenity in our protest. He jumped onto the stage, grabbed the mike and began giving a rabble-rousing speech, spitting abusive words, and not hiding his anger against the government.”

“The audience loved it. But that night, at Hedgewar Bhavan, the senior Sangh leaders scolded Modi for his detrimental and unwarranted act—for a nearly-underground Sangh pracharak to come out in the open. ‘Forget about speaking,’ they lectured him, ‘you shouldn’t have even gone there. Even if the meeting failed, it would be okay, but discipline and obedience to one’s role is superior to all.’”

For all his allegiance to the Sangh and its ideology, the organisation’s structure and style—placing the group above the individual, restraining one’s anger, respecting the protocols established by the leadership—did not mesh with Modi’s personality.

Shankarsinh Vaghela, who was senior to Modi in the RSS and the BJP, and later became chief minister of Gujarat and one of Modi’s bitter rivals, recalled that even as a young man Narendra chafed at the strictures of the Sangh. “Modi used to miss the morning shakha quite often by sleeping late,” Vaghela said. “He always used to do things differently from others in the group—if all of us wore long-sleeved kurtas, he used to wear short sleeves, and when all of us wore khaki shorts, he wore white shorts. And I remember one day the visiting RSS leader Golwalkar questioning Modi in public for keeping a trimmed beard.”

#His economic record in Gujarat

In the wake of the 2002 riots, Modi skillfully painted any criticism of his government’s misdeeds as an attack on Gujarat and Gujaratis. Over the past few years, and with considerably more subtlety, he has achieved the same thing with the story of the state’s development miracle. The government has relentlessly provided the media with positive stories of efficient administration, rapid construction and economic growth.

Modi likes to flaunt the fact that Gujarat is a power-excess state, and almost every big-picture story about the “Gujarat miracle”, from Business Today to The Sydney Morning Herald, highlights this fact. But farmers, led by the Sangh’s own farmers’ union, have been protesting for almost a decade that their electricity needs aren’t being met, and government statistics show that the share of power diverted to agriculture has fallen from 43 percent to 21 percent between 2000 and 2010. More than 375,000 farmers are still waiting for electricity connections for their irrigation pumps.

Even the headline figures for Gujarat’s economic expansion in the past decade diminish under closer examination. The state’s GDP growth has only slightly outpaced India as a whole over the past decade. But this is to be expected: Gujarat has long been an industrialised state—and in fact, growth rates under Modi are not significantly higher than they were in the prior two decades. Though Modi has presented Gujarat as the clear leader among Indian states in attracting foreign direct investment, it ranked fourth among states on this measure between 2000 and 2009, and in 2011 fell to sixth place, after Maharashtra, the National Capital Region, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh; Maharashtra has foreign direct investment inflows almost nine times greater than Gujarat.

Data from the Planning Commission, meanwhile, show that in spite of Gujarat’s economic growth, the state lags behind even Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in rates of poverty reduction. According to the 2011 India Human Development Report, Gujarat also scores poorly in several social indicators, with 44 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, worse than Uttar Pradesh.

By themselves, these statistics hardly constitute an indictment of Modi’s record. They merely suggest that his carefully constructed image as an economic miracle-worker has been the result of a well-managed public relations campaign whose false premise is that Gujarat stands head and shoulders above every other Indian state in growth and development—and that anyone who presents data to challenge this narrative is only twisting the truth in order to malign Modi and every Gujarati.

#How he deals with opponents inside his party

AT THE TIME OF THE 2002 RIOTS, Gordhan Zadaphia was Gujarat’s minister of state for home affairs—junior to Modi, who also held the home portfolio—and like Modi, he stands accused of complicity in the violence. A VHP leader in Gujarat for 15 years, Zadaphia joined the BJP in the early 1990s. “The RSS told me to work in the BJP, and I became a general secretary for the party in Gujarat,” Zadaphia explained.

He is also one of three prominent leaders in the Gujarat BJP—all of them with impeccable Sangh credentials—who spoke out against Modi’s autocratic style within the party. The first, Haren Pandya, who had served as Modi’s revenue minister, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 2003. The second, Sanjay Joshi, who had become a general secretary in the national BJP, was forced to resign when a CD containing pictures of him with naked women—later determined to be fake—was anonymously circulated to top BJP leaders. And Zadaphia, the third, was pushed out of the cabinet by the end of 2002, and subsequently ejected from the party.

“Modi understands only one alphabet, and that is capital I,” Zadaphia told me. “I was threatened with death by Modi himself.”

“It was in February 2005,” Zadaphia continued. “I noticed an intelligence man from the state police following me, and when I confronted him, he told me he was instructed by the home minister’s office to shadow me.” A few days later, Zadaphia said, there was a meeting of BJP legislators with the chief minister. “I asked Modi in the meeting, ‘Narendrabhai, what kind of spy activities are you doing against your own party legislators?’ I asked, why is an intelligence man following me? Then Vajubhai Vala, a senior minister, took the microphone and said ‘Okay Gordhanbhai, cool down. We will look into it, but this is not a question to be asked now.’ Modi didn’t speak at all, but I got a note from his secretary that said ‘Please meet the CM.’”

“I met him at his chamber after the meeting. [Deputy home minister] Amit Shah was sitting there. Modi asked me, ‘Why are you asking these kinds of questions in public?’ I said, ‘What shall I do? It is not a private matter.’ Then he looked sternly into my eyes and said, ‘Khatam ho jaoge Govardhanbhai…’—You’re going to get finished.’”

“I asked him, what kind of finishing? Physically or politically?”

“He said, ‘You complained against me to LK Advani and Om Mathur in Delhi.’”

“I said, of course. There’s no option for me other than to complain to the people in Delhi. But if you’re saying you will finish me off, let me tell you, I’ll die when my time comes. Don’t try to threaten me again.”

Zadaphia moves around with a police escort and a dozen armed security men; as a former deputy home minister—and a controversial one at that—he was offered protection by the government after the riots. Pandya, however, did not have security guards. “Haren was bold,” Zadaphia said. “He thought nothing would happen to him. That was a mistake.”

A tall and handsome Brahmin with a fine RSS pedigree and excellent connections in the media, Pandya was a formidable political rival for Modi within the state BJP. The two clashed publicly for the first time in 2001, when Modi was in search of a safe assembly seat to contest after his appointment as CM. He wanted to run from Pandya’s constituency, Ellisbridge in Ahmedabad—a very safe seat for the BJP. But Pandya refused to yield to Modi’s wishes. As a state BJP functionary recalled, “Haren said, ‘Ask me to vacate my seat for a young man in the BJP—I’ll do it. But not for that fellow.’”

In May 2002, three months after the start of the riots, Pandya secretly gave a deposition to an independent fact-finding panel led by Justice VR Krishna Iyer. Modi could not have known what Pandya said, but written records show that Modi’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, instructed the director-general of state intelligence to track Pandya’s movements, and in particular those related to the fact-finding panel. The intelligence director took down the instructions in a register—the entry for 7 June 2002 reads as follows: “Dr PK Mishra added that Shri Harenbhai Pandya, minister for revenue is suspected to be the minister involved in the matter. Thereafter, he gave one mobile number 9824030629 and asked for getting call details.”

Five days later, on 12 June 2002, there is another entry in the register: “Informed Dr PK Mishra that the minister who is suspected to have met the private inquiry commission (Justice VR Krishna Iyer) is known to be Mr Haren Pandya. I also informed that the matter cannot be given in writing as this issue is quite sensitive and not connected with the charter of duties given to State intelligence Bureau vide Bombay Police Manual. It is learnt that the telephone number 9824030629 is the mobile phone of Shri Harenbhai Pandya.”

News reports soon revealed that an unnamed minister in Modi’s cabinet had deposed before the Iyer commission, and described for the first time the meeting at Modi’s residence on the night of the train burning, at which Modi allegedly told his top police and intelligence officers that there would be justice for Godhra the next day, and ordered the police not to stand in the way of the “Hindu backlash”.

The leak provided sufficient evidence for Modi to press a case of indiscipline against Pandya within the BJP, and two months later Pandya was forced to resign from the cabinet. But Modi was not finished. The state elections were due in December 2002, and Modi saw an opportunity to deny Pandya the Ellisbridge seat that he had refused to vacate a year earlier. “Modi never forgets, and never forgives,” the BJP insider close to the chief minister told me. “It doesn’t help a politician to have such longterm vengeance.”

And so Modi denied Pandya the constituency he had represented for 15 years. The leadership of both the RSS and the BJP objected and asked Modi to relent, but he refused. Near the end of November, RSS leader Madan Das Devi went to meet Modi at his residence, carrying a message from the RSS supremo KS Sudarshan, his deputy Mohan Bhagawat, LK Advani and AB Vajpayee: Stop arguing, don’t create division before the elections, and give Pandya his seat. Devi stayed late into the night, but Modi held his ground, the state party functionary said: “He knew he would start getting phone calls from [RSS headquarters] Nagpur and Delhi, since he did not listen to Devi. So that night, by 3 am, he got himself admitted into the Gandhinagar Civil Hospital for exhaustion and fatigue.”

Pandya, according to the party functionary, charged to the hospital to confront Modi. “Haren told him, ‘Don’t sleep like a coward. Have the guts to say no to me.’” Modi refused to budge, and the RSS and BJP leaders finally gave in. Modi left the hospital after two days, and handed Pandya’s seat to a newcomer. And in December, he came back to power riding the post-Godhra wave of communal polarisation.

Pandya, for his part, started to meet with every top leader in the BJP and RSS—in Delhi and in Nagpur—telling them that Modi would destroy the party and the Sangh for his own personal gain. Senior BJP figures, who still regarded Pandya as a valuable asset to the party, decided to transfer him to headquarters in Delhi as a member of the national executive or a party spokesman. “Modi even tried to scuttle that,” Zadaphia told me. “Pandya going to Delhi was going to be harmful for Modi in the long run.”

Three months later, in March 2003, on the day after Pandya received a fax from the party president ordering his shift to Delhi, he was murdered in Ahmedabad. The Gujarat police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) announced that Pandya had been assassinated in a joint operation between Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and the Dubai-based underworld don Dawood Ibrahim. Twelve men were arrested and charged with Pandya’s murder, but eight years later, in September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acquitted every single one and rubbished the entire case. “The investigation has all throughout been botched up and blinkered,” the judge said. “The investigating officers concerned ought to be held accountable for their ineptitude resulting into injustice, huge harassment of many persons concerned and enormous waste of public resources and public time of the courts.”

Pandya’s father, Vithalbhai, has publicly accused Modi of ordering his son’s killing, and moved a petition in the Supreme Court calling for the chief minister to be investigated, though the court dismissed it, citing a lack of evidence.

RB Sreekumar, who headed the state intelligence for a year soon after the riot, told me that he had been asked by the chief minister’s office to regularly give details about the movements and activities of Haren Pandya.

“I’m not saying Modi got Haren Pandya killed. I have no evidence. But the fact remains—anyone who speaks against Modi from inside the BJP gets finished either physically or politically,” Zadaphia told me.",1572190532.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,29,103

1879,"Why is Adultery and Extra Marital affairs a big social taboo in India when the Supreme Court has Decriminalized it?I saw post by a guy here who was shocked by his mother's affair with another man.

If I ever found my father or mother involved in such extra marital relationship after taking each other's consent (I am against cheating), I would never have any problem with it. They are just enjoying life maybe because they are bored of making love with each other, which is common if we think of it from a psychological perspective.

I once spoke to a guy in Canada. He said ""Adultery is good. It saves marriages."" There must have been a reason why european countries like Germany legalized Adultery in 1960's itself whereas India is doing it in 21st century.

We really need to discuss the truth about Adultery.

So the question remains... ""Why is Adultery after taking consent of your wife/husband considered wrong in India?""

Edit 1 : Correction : What I meant was Open marriage, not adultery.

Going by oxford dictionary and not legal terms, Adultery is sex between a married person and someone who is not their husband/wife

Adultery can be divided into two

1 - Cheating in Marriage - Having sex without consent.

2 - Open Marriage - Having sex after consent.

As far as solution to the problems that married couples are facing these days is concerned, I believe live in relationship of one year, followed by an open marriage to raise children is the best solution. This will also end the need to have a divorce.",1572164579.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,51,5

But despite all the cultural history wrestling is not a sport ever present in Indian schools while American schools all have a good wrestling team with them.

This seems like a result of bad mentality among Indians that sports are a waste of time and study is everything that matters.

**Happy Diwali Guys**

In this thread, we write down our prediction of one thing to come until Diwali 2020.

You can make prediction about absolutely anything and you do not necessarily have to justify them. Obviously you have to keep them India-centric.

Some examples at the top of mind: escalation in war, a particular party coming to power in your state, some criminal getting acquitted/found guilty, a bollywood movie breaking records, Sensex levels, exchange rate

Take your pick and some redditor in the Diwali of 2020 will dig out this thread and see how well r/India did.

Last years thread-https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9uxnic/diwali_2018_mark_my_word_thread_and_link_to/

1928,"In link to the post made about the bus ladySo i read that post about the bus lady not willing to let a man have a ladies seat. I was reminded about something that happened last Sunday which i initially thought of sharing here but later I just let it slip.   
  
So last Sunday after taking part in Airtel Delhi half marathon I was on my way back home. So i reached rajiv chowk to take the blue line metro to NOIDA. As the metro arrived i quickly tried to get a seat as i was pretty exhausted since i was up early that morning and ran.   
Just after that some old lady came infront of me and out of my willingness i gave my seat to her. Weirdly enough most of the passengers in that compartment were ladies just a few males sitting here n there. So few station go by me standing next to the door. A old fella easily over 65 gets on the metro.  
Now to my surprise no one immediately offered him a seat. Then he tried to get close to those seats reserved for elders but the ladies sitting on those seats avoided making eye contact with him. He stayed there for a while desparately trying to make a contact so that lady would feel ashamed and give him the seat but No. Then he moved to another seat but No, every woman just turned their head around.    
At this point i was already furious from the behaviour of all these ladies. But i just couldn't step in unless that old guy at least tried to utter a few words which he just didn't. I wanted to but couldn't help him.   
I always offer my seat to the needy or anyone who asks for it, but seeing this i feel do these people even deserve this gesture. Yeah there were few assholes sitting there but not one lady not even the young ones nor the ones sitting on the seats reserved for the olds offered him the seat.   
  
This turned into a pretty salty rant, i tried to keep it as sane i could. Am not a good writer.

For a moment it felt like someone has slapped me hard at my ear only the pain is not there but the feel is exactly the same. There was a loud ringing and I could feel that the hearing has definitely reduced in my right side ear.

Guys be safe in this madness of crackers. Don't get me wrong, I love the Diwali season, the vibes, the lights, the happiness, sweets, new clothes, cleanliness and all. The day of Diwali right from the morning feels different, it feels good, good positive vibes all around, until the pollution takes over at night. Then the air feels bad, it feels contaminated.

Hi guys,

I'm studying Computer Science in Germany and was asked to look into the Indian dairy market to build digital applications for Indian dairy farmers. I did some research and noticed that the majority of farmers just own 1-2 cows. That's why I'm asking: Has anybody a clue why that is? And why farmers don't expand their businesses to make more revenue? I'd be super thankful to get some insights :)!!

Thanks,

i hear this quotation a lot when people say "" India once had a share of 30% of the world economy and that colonialism shrank and industrialized India, well this is at face value makes sort of sense but a. in AD 1000 the Indian subcontinent made up 28% of the worlds population and the industrial revolution played an important role. the simple result is .. as Europe industrialized their economies grew substantially larger than India or china , during and after the 1840's the result of the industrial revolution led to European economies growing and overtaking India and china , the once great silk road trade and spices were now dwarfed by northern European mechanical industries.

Some context regarding this. I have been using the Airtel SIM (I will denote the number by A) from 2015 to 2018 in an old phone which didn't support Whatsapp. Also, I got a new phone in 2017 but not a sim (I got it later, will denote the number by B) and used Whatsapp on my phone using the previous number (A) as I didn't feel the need to change. However, in 2018, my old phone carrying number A stopped working and I stopped getting any messages to that number. However, my whatsapp account was still active using A. Recently, it came to my notice that someone was using that previous number when I got a message on the account that someone registered on facebook using that number. I had exams coming up, so I panicked, did some quick google search on the problem and saw numerous people advicing to delete the account which I did as instructed. On further queries, I came to know that my number has been given to someone else, quite recently I presume since only last week the FB account was opened. I am going to contact the customer care soon, so keeping my fingers crossed for that. 

Apart from that, is there anything I can do? Is it possible for me to get back my number. Also, what would you people recommend me to do so as to get it back?",1572107787.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,9

2185,"Mobile Recharge DilemmaHi,

Not sure if this is a place to ask this question. I recently got a fiber internet connection at home, so I don't need data packs on my phone while I'm in my home. I barely step out of the house. And when I go out, I only need data for essentials like maps and basic messaging on WhatsApp (which amounts to maybe 500mb for a month). I want to cut the costs and save as much as I can. I have two sim cards and both are important for me, one is an airtel (primary) and the other one is Jio (secondary, used for data and outgoing calls).

I usually make recharges of Rs35/month on airtel (to keep incoming on & outgoing SMS/calls for essential stuff) and 1.5gb/day plan on Jio (for data and outgoing calls).

Now I need both numbers active for incoming and atleast one for making outgoing calls. And one number with data of 200mb per month (for *going-out*) I'm willing to port networks if that fulfils my needs.

I've considered the Rs.45 plan of Vodafone which gives full-talktime but that doesn't have any data, so that's a bummer. And it would be Rs.90 for a month for two sims, which is a lot considering that I'm not even getting data benefits.

Can you guys please help me out choosing the best plan and cutting costs as much as I can?

My location is Karnataka circle.

I came in thinking "" I won't like finance, its not for me. I'll take marketing!"". Turns out that I hate marketing(just feel its a lot of fluff) and loved the finance subjects here. But I have no finance background and the only roles that seem like a natural jump while placements are underway are PM roles. I wanted to get into consulting but my CGPA is not that great.

I'm really confused and anxious about my career, but in some corner of my heart I want to try what the finance field offers. I have no finance background like the other CAs/CFA L3s/ Bain, BCG consultants.

Even when Jio reduced the 4G price, I benefited as a consumer and now when Amazon/Flipkart offers deep discounts, I am benefited. So, why should I even complain?

Basically, all this talk about ""predatory pricing"" is nonsense because neither flipkart, nor amazon are in that kind of monopolistic position to affect prices everywhere, online shopping is done by only a small percentage of urban dwellers.

Nobody has the right to interfere in a free market and especially not the govt. The kirana/local-trader lobby is fighting hard to push their agenda due to their dwindling market-share but hey, what about my right as a consumer?

What needs to be done?I keep seeing posts about India all over reddit and the news is always very negative. It sounds like India is stuck in a time loop of the middle ages. Surely people are doing something about this? I am tired of seeing casual racism but I am also tired of denial too. There has to be a level headed answer. I do not agree with tumblr moral relativism but I also do not agree with the neo Nazis that seek only to demonize Indians.
So I want to make a repository of social justice issues afflicting India and a ready reference for what Indians are doing to fix this.

The first thing that comes into my mind when I ask why India is still developing is the fact we are lacking true motivation. Let us go back to the time when we were born. If a female kid was born our parents give birth to one more child hoping that it might be a boy. This is because they are afraid they have to save huge lots of money for the marriage of a girl and not for her dreams. DEAR PARENTS OUR DAUGHTERS ARE ALSO A HUMAN BEING, THEY HAVE DREAMS. PLEASE DON’T BLIND FOLD US. Remember those days as what you were told by your relatives/society, if you are boy ” hey you need to study well and get a job because that will fetch you a good wife”(What did they meant by good wife or husband). And if it was a girl “hey you have to learn cooking, this will secure you a good husband. This way we have rejected 50 percent of our own future gems.

This is the reason we are still lacking innovation and poor NARENDRA MODI is still doing foreign visits or else he would have been in our own country and listen to us. He is going to foreign to ask them put their companies in India which can provide us jobs. Can’t we be innovators ? Yes we can ..So where and what is the motivation ? I told that I want to opt for ‘Civil engineer’ and they told if you choose civil engineering you are going to lose entertainment. Is opposite sex is there only to entertain us ?? Can’t we find entertainment in education ?? If you truly love what you are doing then that is called HAPPINESS and Entertainment is just a minute part of happiness. Show us true motivation to opt the field we want. I am sorry that we are not investing so much into Research and Development Department. This is the reason most of the students who have opted for ‘Electronics or mechanical or any other field’ are doing ‘software jobs’. We need to fix this big gap so as to walk hand in hand. We forgot about arts, economics , law and the list goes on… If only when all the intelligence /education is equally distributed we will move forward. Let it be distributed in Law, politics, literature, arts …

“ DOWRY ” :- I was born and the GENDER has divided me. Our relatives or parents say ” hey you have to put on or cut back weight ” so that you won’t be facing any problems when you ask or being asked for dowry. DUDE !! Seriously ??? “Daughter you have to cut back some weight, by doing so that ‘bridegroom’ can decrease the dowry by 5 lakhs and yes use this ‘fairness cream’ if you become a little fair and there is a room that 5 more lakhs can be reduced. Dear Parents I beg you, instead of investing the amount on getting her married to a unknown guy please trust your daughter and please ask her opinions or dreams and your daughter will be more than happy .She is not a toy. Your daughter is good at quilling or painting or boutique or dancing or embroidery or what not and not to forget cooking (Engineering is already added as it is a default subject ). This way we can bring out ENTREPRENEURS. If you yourself is not accepting your daughter’s potential how can she or someone can motivate her ??

Let ‘health consciousness’ be the motivation to put on or cut back weight. I recently heard a 22 year guy died doing work out in a GYM ..

I don’t know why is still DOWRY prevailing now a days. OK let us go to past and say that girl is going to live with her husband’s family so she is paying for the ACCOMMODATION and FOOD, but dude you have made her work like a slave , cook for your entire family and she also has given kids and took care of them , so this should gets nullified right ?? Now , coming to our generation where females are also working, what is the need of asking/giving dowry when both of them are staying away from their family. And I don’t know why females are still cooking and taking care of kids ? Both should have equal hands on everything right ??? come on!! ask or else they will bend you and drop to their feet …

“ MOVIES ” :-Movies are the things we choose to watch them voluntarily and it is not like our education which we have opted it by opinion of others or by the manipulation of the society. So, movies have direct impact on us as we have decided to watch them .

The things we love will enter directly into our mind because they stimulate us and we want to imitate the same. In my opinion most of the Tollywood and Bollywood movies has only shown how to attain the opposite gender, flirting and getting married or how to move on after break up or some racist/sexist comedy movies. I can barely name some movies which has shown how to love yourself, I mean how to be passionate for a goal or how to think greatly or how to find motivation. Yes entertainment is necessary but not at the cost of discouraging or misleading someone/other tribes.

First of all we need to address the problems in India before we can begin. I will start by listing some of the issues that tend to get posted all over reddit, and see if the community here can help to point to steps taken by the government, society or Indians to change things for the better.

I'm aware about the current unemployment situation in this country and how the mass number of engineers are unemployed, but the reason for this can also be favored to the lack of quality and practical education in the country from most of the institutions, as one report says ***94% of engineering graduates are not fit for hiring.***

Apparently burger King has got this 3 minute delivery policy and it had just passed 3 minutes for her. Hearing the commotion everyone turned towards her and I couldn't believe my eyes.

Behold! A true fine specimen of the famed Karen stereotype. She had the proper hairstyle and was yelling ""I need to talk to your manager"".

I was like ""omg! I just found a Karen"" and then we were talking about how disgusting she is for making such a scene over a trivial matter.

She kept repeating ""No! Three minutes is three minutes. What is the penalty? I need the penalty"". You could literally see the disgust in everyone's face. Poor manager tried reasoning with her but she wasn't having any of it. 

So! even though angry, manager simply gave her an extra glass of her drink. That's when a man standing close to us for the entire duration walked upto her and put the glass back on the counter.

It was her husband and poor guy had heard everything we were saying. But Karen wasn't having it though. She was like ""no no no... That is my penalty. There has to be a penalty"" and put it back on her tray.

If you saw this in person, you would literally feel sorry for that poor man. He gingerly followed her to their table, all quiet and gloom. We genuinely felt so bad for him and his life.

And that's how we found our first Karen in the wild. And yeah! Even though I am paraphrasing, those are almost her exact words. In fluent English and she looked very well off. But no! Had to be a Karen over few seconds and a cup of Pepsi. Some people are just disgusting.

>Apple removed 18 apps from the App Store on Friday for violating the company's policies on adware.


>The apps, which were discovered by security company Wandera, span fitness, productivity, travel, and other categories. They were all published by India-based developed AppAspect Technologies Pvt. Ltd. ZDNet was the first to report that the apps were removed.


>Wandera researchers found that the apps contained trojan-clicker malware, meaning that the apps could open links or webpages in the background and click them without the user's knowledge, which can artificially inflate traffic and generate ad revenue for the owner. Known as adware, it isn't necessarily as dangerous as other forms of malware, but it can drain a device's battery life.
An Apple spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that 18 apps were removed for having code that allowed for the artificial click-through of ads, which is a violation of Apple's guidelines. A spokesperson told told ZDNet that Apple had updated its security measures to prevent similar apps from making it into the App Store in the future.


> AppAspect Technologies also has apps for the Google Play Store. Because of weaker security protections on Android devices, the malware was able to do more harm on the devices, including gather private information and signing users up for expensive subscriptions, 9to5Mac reported.


> Ten of the apps removed by Apple were still available in the Google Play Store as of publishing, including Daily Fitness Yoga Poses and Placefinder.

2250,"Just dodged a bullet! Beware of cyber criminals!Today at about 10:30 am I got a call. The guy was talking in Hindi. He said he is speaking from Phonepe company and he said that I have 1800 rupees cashbacks pending to be transferred to my wallet. I had uninstalled Phonepe app a month ago and I had not linked my bank account. So he asked me to install Phonepe and link my bank account so that he can transfer the money to my bank account. I downloaded Phonepe and linked my bank account. I even gave him my Airtel number, so that he can call me in that while I can use internet in the other sim card. I have tried linking my bank account to my Phonepe account before and it took a lot of time for Phonepe to fetch my bank account details, like a lot of time. And therefore I had uninstalled it. Now, again it was taking some time and I asked him how much time does it take to load. He said he can make it load if I go to Google play store and install ANYDESK APP. I searched for the app in playstore and saw it was a remote access app. I felt something was wrong with this guy and so I asked why do I need to install this app. He tried to convince me but I stalled him and finally my bank account details were ready. Then it showed me to add the last 6 digits of my card and expiry date. Quite cunningly, he asked me to tell him the last digits of my card. I  was almost going to say it but I told him to wait while I add in the details. 

Then finally with my bank and card linked, I expected the money in my wallet but I got a request from safe gold company having a name Annu Roy with a bank account ××××××××8637 to pay them 1799 rupees. He didn't say me to click on the pay button, he said me to click on the button that says P, A, Y. Now I know these mind tricks. And I was convinced this guy is a professional fraudster. I asked why should I pay this person 1800 rupees when YOU should give me 1800 rupees? He said I have to click on that button so that he can transfer that money to my account. I said him that even if I did click, I don't have that much money in my account. He said me that I shouldn't fear if I don't have that much money. I asked him what if my money gets automatically debited later when I deposit. He said if I don't believe him, then it's fine. I said OK. Then he stayed silent for sometime and then he cut the call. I declined the request by safe gold. 

Later, I found out from my sister that one of her friends has lost 10000 rupees by a similar call! That guy also asked him to ANYDESK APP and by using that app he had access to all her details and stole 10000 rupees from her bank account. Now, either he was going to use my account to pay for the gold from safe gold OR he was going to debit all my money( but since I am broke currently, he could have waited till I made a deposit). He can definitely view my bank account details from my number, I don't know how. But I am not sure if he can access my account. He needed that app to be installed in my phone so that he can have access to my screen that would show my OTP and password. If it's possible to hack a bank account by just a number then please inform me.

Please beware of such fraud calls and think twice before giving out any details. I gave him only my Airtel number that is linked to the bank account and he could say the name of my mother(it's my mother's bank account). Do not download and install softwares that are not trustworthy and ask for permission that may compromise your personal and financial details, definitely not ANYDESK APP.

2252,"Are Indians just a cheap commodity to the worldWhilst it's nice to see India represented nicely in the World stage, against the tidal wave of memes about us being Gang Rapists, Street shitters, curry eaters and tribalistic cavemen (I can go on and on big you get the picture)... I feel people look at Indians as a commodity instead of as people. This is a bit of a rant, but I'll elaborate.

For example, before the last Cricket world cup, reddit cricket was awash with a few Footballers and athletes from different sports taking selfies with Indian shirts saying ""I support Team India"".

/Cricket was awash with fawning Indian fans. Granted, I know most will be young fans, but something didn't sit right with me. Its clear that these stars dont even know what cricket is, let alone there is a WC going on.... It was clearly just a PR Strategy. 
The similar thing was done by alot of companies when it comes to Bollywood.

I just found it soooooo patronizing and condescending. They know Indians would eat that shit straight out of their hands. The know quality doesnt mean anything but quantity goes along way. India has a very fad based culture. So consumerism of merchandise is easy $$$ for International companies.

I dont blame the companies, its basic marketing. I just wish Indians would be self aware and appreciate that these people dont give a shit about Indians except our wallets and want us eating out of their hands. We make ourselves look desperate and pathetic.",1572087159.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,33,108

2260,"I wasn't sure about posting this..I've finally witnessed something that I'm having a hard time to fathom the reason for. We all see these type of things on internet all the time but to experience it in real life sure did put a grimace on my face and thoughts.

Okay so what happened is I left the office and continued to board one of those ""RTV"" buses to the route back home and after a meticulous scan of seats I found one of them to be empty. There was a lady sitting on the other half of that seat middle aged..

So as soon as I proceeded to sit she furiously yelled "" This is a ladies seat"" and proceeded to roll back her eyes as I looked at her with a expressionless face. It indeed was a ladies seat but there were no ladies in the bus to sit on it. So I told her that there are no ladies in the bus and if a lady comes I'll just stand up in a polite tone. She declined again and put her handbag on the seat. It's a fairly long route around 2 hours and her reasoning was not too strong. Everyone grew uncomfortable at this but decided not to speak till this point. I again tried to request her to let me sit as most of the offices were close today and there was a hood chance that no lady will board the bus. Like...what the heck is this lady's problem? She declined again and started blaming it's because of people like me ladies can't travel in bus. Like what the actual fuck is wrong with her... I told the conductor and he told her that I can sit unless a lady boards the bus. She declined with that same angry tone. The conductor grew loud in tone too.. telling her that she can't do this and she isn't someone special who won't let someone sit..At this point other people were telling her to take a Ola if she have that snowflake personality. And she just continued to give damn stupid reasons like they should take the Ola and what not... it was so very fucked up...but after a fair amount of pressure from the others I was allowed to sit. Then a lady boards the bus and the moment she got on the lady sitting next to me started blaming me again that because of men like me women don't get to sit when I already gestured for that other women to offer my seat but she declined because her stop was literally 3-4 minutes away. 

Idk what the fuck was that but I sure as hell would never want to experience a person like that in life.",1572106392.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,45,196

Yesterday, Dushayant Chautala gave support to BJP and today his father Ajay Chautala has been granted furlough from jail.The BJP had failed to secure the majority Haryana assembly. Dushyant’s JJP, won 10 seats while fighting and campaigning against the BJP. However on Friday he met Amit Shah to pledge his support to the BJP.

Ajay Chautala and 53 others were convicted for appointment of 3,206 junior basic teachers. In January 2013 a New Delhi court sentenced Chautala and his father Om Prakash Chautala to ten years' imprisonment under various provisions of the IPC and the Prevention of Corruption Act. This sentence was upheld by High Court and Supreme Court.

BHIM sends you a money recieve request, you open the app, go to transactions, accept it, double accept it and then finally order is placed. Too long.

Now here comes our Papa Payment. In Phonepay, there is some window that pops up from bottom, you tap on pay and boom... in just 5 seconds, your order is placed and you recieve message from your bank that money has been debited.

2401,"Startup Companies in India are Fighting PovertyWith a booming population and competitive economy,[ India](https://borgenproject.org/top-10-facts-about-hunger-in-india/) has made a mark in the global playing field. However, nearly 60 percent of India’s population lives on $3.10 per day and 21 percent (250 million people) live on $2 per day. The uneven spread of wealth leaves many people in poor living conditions. The top 1 percent of Indians own [58 percent of India’s wealth](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2017/10/world/i-on-india-income-gap/), meaning 16 people own the wealth of 600 million people. Unfortunately, over 70 percent of the population still lives in rural villages and work labor-intensive jobs with minimal profits.

The extremely high growth rate of the population leads to [a strain on resources](https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/society/poverty-in-india-and-its-causes). This leads to growing illiteracy and a lack of health care facilities and services. Some expect the total Indian population to reach 1.5 billion by 2026 which means the country will require 20 million new jobs to sustain its people. There is now a desperate need for a better solution to pull people and their families out of poverty.

#### The Nature of Startup Companies in India

The economy in India continues to compete on a global scale as highly intellectual individuals are progressing with new businesses and startups. In fact, India is the home of 48 million new businesses, which is more than twice the number in the United States at 23 million. The startup companies in India have unlimited access to [software and intelligence](https://www.inc.com/aj-agrawal/the-differences-of-entrepreneurship-in-india-compared-to-the-u-s.html), making it a competitive playing field. Due to the startups, India has the fastest growing economy and market place in the entire world, taking over China and the United States.

The number of startup companies in India is continuing to grow from 3,100 companies in 2014 to an expected number of 11,500 companies by 2020. The current day and age make India an ideal place of startups as entrepreneurs have access to the internet, educational initiatives and experienced mentors. All of these factors [improve the success](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ajayyadav/2016/08/18/how-startup-culture-in-india-differs-from-the-u-s/#11ec3496bedb) of startup companies. India has the third-largest startup ecosystem in the world, which was worth over $32 billion in market valuation in 2017. The ever-growing field has drawn in numerous foreign investors leading to a 167 percent growth in 2016 alone.

#### How Startup Companies Create Jobs

The Indian government has recognized the growing startup companies and has created a plan for ‘New India.’ This involves encouraging employment among the youth. The millennials in India can take advantage of the possible employment ventures as startups create an open atmosphere for innovation. With new information trends every year, these creative companies are creating jobs for people and reducing poverty as people can better support themselves and their families. The startups alone create [one billion jobs for millennials](https://yourstory.com/2017/09/startups-jobs-1-billion-millennials-india/). Companies such as Flipkart, Ola and PayTM have an equity of $1 billion, inspiring young entrepreneurs to take risks and start companies. In 2016, India had the most job creation of all countries in the Asia and Pacific Region.

#### What Now?

Despite the high poverty rates in India, there are new opportunities emerging for people to improve their living conditions. The startup companies in India are extremely successful and allow for families to improve their financial standings. The nature of the startup ecosystem makes it easier for people to start new businesses and become successful. Startup companies in India are changing lives and the same could happen in other countries.

I have worked in reputed research labs (both academia and industry) and  have a background in Drug delivery and molecular biology.

But did you know that none of these nations were democracies when they accumulated their wealth? They were either monarchies or voting was restricted to a very small number of people like land-owning males above a certain age (for example, only property owning, tax-paying white males could vote in the US which was about 6% of the population, this was the case for around the first 100 years of the history of the US), did you know that the reason they invade these countries to push democracy is so that the country becomes wide open to foreign meddling? Why do you think they are trying to push democracy on China so much, even though they are doing do well?

So my question is, do you think democracy is the reason India is failing? China was also raped and plundered yet has managed to become a world superpower in 70 years, meanwhile India is still not very powerful and is regarded as a joke abroad, no matter how much Indians boast about X% of [Insert American founded company here]'s employees being Indian, we will always be regarded as an extremely dirty country which is only good for cheap IT service and outsourcing call centre jobs. None of our universities are in the top 200 in the world while many Chinese universities are.

Democracy in my opinion can never allow India to realise it's full potential, democracy is nothing but media rule, the media company owners will always promise to give positive coverage to politicians in return for tax cuts or policies that benefit their other companies, they will never speak truth to power.

2447,"Can somebody explain it to me why it is wrong to prohibit women in Sabarimala?I want to have this discussion in good faith. So please don't downvote and kill this thread without even reading. 
Please convince me and tell me where I am going wrong. 



I see nothing wrong in prohibiting women or men in a particular temple or mosque or church. Or in certain sections of said mosque church temple. 



--Hinduism is made of thousands of different sects, belief systems, ideas etc so much so that if anyone tries to limit it to a set of beliefs like the RSS or. BJP sometimes do.. They will be in the wrong. 


-- This particular sect States that the deity is a celibate and does not want to come in contact with fertile women.

Why should it matter that it is stupid or intelligent or smart or foolish. 

It is a belief. All religious beliefs are man made and stupid according to me. But people are free to believe whatever they want to. This is religious freedom. 

-- As long as nobody is imposing their beliefs on others, and the belief is not causing harm to others...
We should respect it. We can critique it if we want to. But we shouldn't impose our own belief system onto others forcefully. 


-- Now somebody will say that this prohibition is causing harm to women. How? 


If you are a genuine devotee of Lord Ayappa or whatever the lords name is.. And you believe in this particular sect. You will believe that he doesn't want to come in contact with women. So why would any women want to do what the lord specifically did not want them to do. It is like a jain person doing animal sacrifice. Going completely against the basic tenet of the sect. 


That is why no women believing in the sect wants to go there.


And if you don't like this sect and its prohibition of visiting the deity in the temple, then change your sect, change your religion, become atheist...do whatever you want. 


And I don't see any harm if you don't get to go to this particular temple where the deity specifically wishes you not come. 


Go to other temples man. Or pray from the base of the temple or whatever. 


-- But what if I want to reform the religion, one might ask. I want to have a lord ayappa sect which welcomes women to touch the deity and take selfies with deity etc etc. Or whatever reform one wants to have. 


So start your own temple. Your own sect. Nobody is stopping you. If somebody stops you, then they will be wrong, and I will fight for your right to your religious freedom. 


Start your own lord ayappa sect and add many other idols of women around it. Make it only for women. Do whatever it is that you want to. Preach your new sect. 


For example- Homosexuality is prohibited in all abrahamic religions. 
A gay person cannot become the leader of a mosque or a church (technically).


You cannot force Delhi Jama Masjid or Kalkaji Church to allow a gay person to become the imam or the pastor who will lead the prayer. This is against religious freedom. 


But at the same time, gay Muslims and Christians can open up lgbt mosques and churches and welcome all people there. 


Gay Imam in LGBT friendly mosque in South Africa 
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-safrica-lgbt-religion-idUSKCN1PU0J9




-- Forcing your own belief systems onto religious sects and beliefs is wrong and stupid. 


If there is a bali sect among Hindus where goats and cattle are sacrificed, it is improper for other vegetarian Hindus to force them to stop their balis.

You can try and reform. You can try and convince. You can start your own counter sect. But you cannot force. 


This is wrong.

People who are neck deep in corruption cases, people who's sole experience is in acting/sports, people who went to/are in jail, people who are accused in bomb blasts are getting elected.

Why is it then that we don't see anyone taking the effort to get into politics? Is it such a bad field? Surely, it can't be worse than being a mechanical engineer in TCS. Are the returns so small when compared to efforts? Are the initial ""investments"" so high that a common man can't even imagine? 

Is it the innocent bystander effect?

I was on my way to work this morning in a narrow road and the activa in front of me made a sudden stop with out any warning. I was doing about 45-50 kmph and even though there was some space between us it wasn't enough and I hit him. His vehicle fell on its side and resulted in broken taillight and scratches on the body. The rider thankfully got away with just a few bruises on his hand.

Now when he was up on his feet he straightaway came to me and accused me of not maintaining distance and said the whole thing was my mistake. He agrees that he had applied sudden break but says it is my job to keep safe distance.

So after arguing for a few minutes he demands that I pay him Rs 6000 for the damages caused (broken taillight and scratches on the side). I don't know how he came to that number but he says he is quite sure that it would come up to that much. I straightaway refused to pay any money and told him I'll be willing to take him to a nearby garage and get it fixed there in my presence and pay. He did not agree to it and said that he will file a complaint against me to the police. Before I could say anything he took a photo of my vehicle number plate and went away.

Who will take him to the hospital? 

Once the doctor recommends bedrest, who will cook food for him at home? Who will serve him and take care?

How do these sick people manage without any one else?

It could be a guy who lives alone. A wife whose husband has to go to work while her children are too young.

 So many cases I can think of.

Edit 1 : What do you all think of getting yourself admitted in a subsidized government hospital for few days/week/ a month while that illness lasts?

Maybe Kejriwal's Delhi Hospitals have a good system for such people where the nurses would  professionally attend them and will be at the risk of losing their source of living if they show any neglect? I am not sure if it exists in Gov hospitals.. so asking.

Nursing Bureau's are simply impractical for average middle class. They are expensive.

Because I am not in favour of depending on Family, relatives and friends..who I call the free labourers. Even if these free labourers ignore you during emergency, they lose nothing as it is not their job to save your life. They owe you nothing. You are not paying them.

2768,"A take on the situation around the telcos of India (Airtel/Voda-Idea/Jio)The amount owed by the current telcos after the recent Supreme Court ruling is:

Airtel - 21,682 Crores

Vodafone - 19,824 Crores

Reliance Jio - 13 Crores

https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/agr-verdict-jio-emerges-winner-as-airtel-voda-idea-face-7-billion-bill-119102500335_1.html



What does the government think is going to happen now? 

Airtel and Voda won't have money left for the MOST expensive spectrum (5G) in the world, because:

A) It's fuuuucking expensive. Look at any frequency range, 2G, 3G, 4G and you'll find that India is in the top 3 most expensive in the world, making our spectrum one of the costliest in the world. 

B) India has the cheapest data rates in the world. A Gb of data costs 26 cents ($0.26) in India. The global average is $8.53, while in UK it costs $12.37 so we're essentially selling one of the world's most expensive spectrums for the cheapest rate in the world. 

https://www.livemint.com/Industry/JJtrg2bBRl0kuchQ8imHWI/Indias-airwaves-among-the-costliest-in-the-world.html

https://m.economictimes.com/tech/internet/india-has-the-cheapest-mobile-data-in-world-study/articleshow/68285820.cms



On top of this, the courts recently upheld a ruling on favor of Reliance Jio in which they were theoretically acquiring 5000 Cr worth of assets for 900 Cr investment. Airtel had participated for this bid against Reliance Jio in which the contract entailed that all of Maharashtra government offices would be connected by the Telco over fiber.

The catch was that the government would waive off all road digging fees which the telco would have to pay to undertake this project. The total worth of these road digging rights was 5000 Crores which would've been paid to the government under normal circumstances. And the Telco obviously could use the same fiber for their other clients thus opening up the potential for a lot of profits. The cost for putting the fiber was around 900 Crores which the telcos would've easily recovered, and would get 5000 crores of assets in return for their 900 Crore investment in fiber.

Reliance put in a really low nominal, almost zero and it went through. Airtel tried to put in a negative bid - basically that they'll give the government money to do their project instead of charging them for it. Airtels negative bid wasn't accepted by the computer systems running the bid. Airtel appealed against this in court AND LOST to Reliance Jio. Airtel should've been allowed to put in a negative bid but the court ruled in the favor of Reliance Jio.

The second group of people loves music. Who doesn't? Have you met anyone who says ""I hate music with a passion"" No dude, everyone likes to listen to music.

## Tl;dr

Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of Kashmir Times, had filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the communication shutdown in Kashmir. Two journalistic bodies- Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union- had intervened in the case to support press freedom in Kashmir. Yesterday, the State Government filed an additional affidavit stating that the communication shutdown was necessary because of cross-border terrorism and it has declined to provide any further explanation or materials to the Petitioner or Intervenors.

## State Government files Additional Affidavit

On the factual aspects, the Government has argued that Jammu and Kashmir has a history of cross-border terrorism and the communication shutdown is necessary because terrorists *""not only physically penetrate the Indian borders""* but also *""digitally penetrate to take advantage of certain local situation.""* The Government has also cited the three month long internet shutdown imposed in the State in 2016 after the death of Burhan Wani to cast aspersions and demanded that the Court seek an explanation from the Petitioner about why she did not approach the judiciary then.

With respect to production of orders, the Government has annexed specimen orders which do not provide any clear reasons for their issuance. The specimen orders are extremely vague and merely state that data services should be suspended or slowed down to 2G speed *""in view of apprehension of misuse of data services by anti-national elements.""* The Government has characterized the demand for production of orders as a *""roving and fishing enquiry""* which must not be permitted. The Government has also strenuously objected to the Petitioner and Intervenors being provided access to the material based on which these orders have been issued but has agreed to let the Court view it.

Regarding the applicable legal standards, the Government has urged the Court to defer to the opinion of the administrative authorities in Kashmir because they are aware of ground realities and such decisions always involve an element of subjectivity. Further, the Government has cited a case in which the Supreme Court upheld a complete ban on the slaughter of bulls and bullocks (State of Gujarat v. Mirzapur Moti Kureshi Kassab Jamat) to argue that a total prohibition on exercise of fundamental rights is justified if there is no lesser adequate alternative. Finally, the Government has reiterated its stance that the communication shutdown was a temporary and need based restriction which was aimed at *""pre-empting inflammation of passions, rumour mongering etc.""*

## Supreme Court adjourns matter for oral arguments

Although the case was originally supposed to be heard on Friday, 25 October 2019, it was unexpectedly listed a day earlier. To the best of our knowledge, the change happened because the judges were busy with another matter tomorrow. The Court indicated that since all parties have filed their pleadings, the lawyers could commence their oral arguments on the next date and listed the case for hearing on 5 November 2019.

During the brief hearing, the Court indicated that the Solicitor General should provide a clear time frame for easing of restrictions, and even if the restrictions were justified in public interest, they should be periodically reviewed. The Counsel for the Petitioner, Ms. Vrinda Grover stated that the orders of the Review Committee should be produced if the Government is claiming that it is constantly monitoring the situation on the ground. In response, the Solicitor General raised the specter of cross-border terrorism again and criticized the Petitioner and Intervenors for acting like ostriches with their heads in the sand. He also launched ad hominem attacks against the Petitioner and Intervenors and sought an explanation about why they did not approach the Court when internet was suspended in Kashmir for 3 months in 2016 after the death of Burhan Wani.

As internet services continue to remain suspended in the Kashmir Valley, we hope that a substantive hearing on merits will take place on 5 November 2019. The Government's approach so far has been vaguely citing ""national security"" and delaying effective adjudication of the dispute by refusing to disclose any relevant or  specific information. Without access to specific information about actual incidents threatening sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the State or public order, it would be difficult for the Petitioner and Intervenors to demonstrate the unreasonable and disproportionate nature of the restrictions. Therefore, the Court must direct the Government to at the very least provide aggregate facts and figures about the ground reality in different districts of Kashmir and the burden should be placed upon the Government to prove how each piece of relevant information which is being withheld can threaten national security.

However I am confused. Do I need both? The pyrolitic oven can reach higher temperatures than the steam oven.

Also, I am concerned that the standard built-in oven is 60cm in size, and I am having a bit of trouble finding a bigger model without spending stupid sums on a Wolf oven.

Should I get a range like Bertazzoni/La Germania or Elica instead? Those will come with much larger ovens.

But nothing happens  if you harm your child in subtle ways as a parent.

Nobody cares.

You can scold him, taunt him, block financial support in case he raises his voice for the right thing, spend money on lavish things but ignore the child if he asks money for actual need, persuade the child towards a career path of your preference, enforce your stupid decisions on the child, beat him and if he becomes another liability for you, just kick him out of your house.

I have read multiple cases like this here on r/india where parents treat their child as a labourer who is expected to behave in a certain way, because well, they have born and brought him up.

I don't get it. If I will ever give birth to a child, my goal will be to just to feed and nurture him untill 21 and then he shall be on his own.

As the title says, my company (financial software/services) is setting up a new office for developers in Noida, India. They are asking for volunteers to help set up the new office and spend ""some time"" (not sure how long) there to help set up the office. The idea is interesting to me, but I'm a white American who has never visited India and doesn't know much about the culture. Although I've heard of some cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore), I'm not familiar with Noida. I'm interested in living somewhere new for a bit and being exposed to a different culture, but really don't know what it would be like! I'm 31-years-old and single, if it matters. Edit: I'm male.

A few questions:

* My company would try to put me in a safer area, but is Noida generally safe?
* How hard would it be to get by only speaking English?
* How are Americans/Westerners typically treated? Would I be a target? Would people stare at me?
* I workout/bodybuild -- are there gyms there? What is gym culture like?
* What is IT/developer office culture like?
* What do office workers usually do after work or on their days off?
* Do you think it's a good idea for me to go?

Any other advice appreciated!

## Tl;dr

The Standing Committee of Information Technology is holding a meeting on October 25, 2019 where it will be briefed by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on safeguarding citzens online. We provide the Committee with a few issues to enquire about from MEITY on the issues of community data, transparency processess and even the investigation into the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

## Concerns we think need to be raised

The Standing Committee of Information Technology will hold its 4th and 5th sitting on October 25, 2019. The agenda for the meeting will include a briefing from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) on the issue of 'Safeguarding citizens’ rights and prevention of misuse of social/online news media platforms including special emphasis on women security in the digital space'.

We provide the Committee with a few issues to enquire about from MEITY on the issues of community data, transparency processess and even the investigation into the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

As this is such a vital issue and a perfect opportunity to engage with MEITY, we write to the Committee with few suggestions the Committee might consider in their discussion:

* ***Committee on community data:*** With the constitution of the Committee of Experts to deliberate a Data Governance Framework by MEITY, we request the Standing Committee to enquire about the criteria based on which the composition of the Data Governance Committee was set up, as there is not only do the members not sufficiently represent both government, industry and civil society organisation but more worrying is the appointment of a chairperson who is an individual from a private industry and likely to put first commercial interest rather than the interests and protection of individuals. We also highlight the concerns with forming Data Governance Framework without even establishing a data protection law prior to this.
* ***Enabling transparency:*** We continue our requests for transparency especially with rgard to the a privately held consultation on the draft Information Technology \[Intermediary Guidelines (Amendment)\] Rules, 2019 and the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 held by MEITY; and also toward the submissions put forth by MEITY during the meeting to be held by the Standing Committee.
* ***Cambridge Analytica investigation***: As the previous IT Standing Committee opened an investigation into the Cambridge Analytica scandal, we ask that the Committee provide the status and any insights from the investigation.

Considering the issue of safeguarding citizen rights online and the environment in which this concern was raised, our representation also flags the need that in future deliberations there be representation by officers from the Election Commission of India due to the recent intertwining nature of social-media platforms and elections.

I have noticed that on educational videos on YouTube (especially related to math), Indians continuously comment on how their exams like IIT and NEET are extremely difficult and the topic/questions presented on the video are extremely easy and they had studied it when they were in their mother's womb or something. This occurs especially in channels that cover mathematics questions and different question papers around the world. If it were 1 or 2 people doing this, it wouldn't be so noticeable but there is literally a metric ton of people doing this who get hundreds of likes on their comments.

3292,"Scams in public places.I Recently started encountering these scams people are coming up with at railway stations and bus stands. They approach you, very friendly, and state they missed their bus/train and ran out of money/got mugged and then ask you for help usually just ₹20-30. I saw one guy at the railway station, but I was out of money, so just said I'm sorry. Then when I went to the bus stand there was this other guy with the same excuse I ignored him and decided to follow him quietly. And he was doing this at random every 5-6 mins , to avoid suspicion. I pointed this out to the police before boarding a bus and they pulled him aside for questioning. Then the other day on the road, I had my bike parked on the side, when a guy approached on his bike asked me if I got change. I asked for how much he needs... His reply was can u lend me ₹50, I forgot my wallet and needed it for fuel. I said sorry I just have my card, he asked if I could Paytm him. I bugged him off - he just seemed sketchy ... He was in a Nearby school uniform and it was 11 am, no way he could be out by now. He was upto something wrong.... if Anyone has any such experiences please share so that others don't fall prey.",1571838043.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,1

I could easily handle boards,maybe CET too but this kind of stuff is out of my league. 

I haven't exactly had any kind of ambition as to what to do after 12th ever. Dad keeps sitting me down and telling me how important it is to know,but to be honest,my whole life I've just let everyone else take decisions for me. It was mom who decided to put me into Sanskrit for 8th - 10th (which I despise myself for not speaking against) and put me into science for 11th-12th even though I'm way out of my depth with these things,and it's her that'll probably put me into engineering after all this,cuz what else am I supposed to do. I got 84% in 10th and I happily accepted everyone's congratulations but deep down I knew it didn't mean shit,any moron with half a good memory could catapult himself into the 90s zone because such is our education pattern. 

And it's not that I've ever had anything forced on me,it's just that I never have an answer to what else I'm going to do. 

Back to the topic,I find myself befuddled with most JEE advanced questions, like an Alzheimer's patient may feel when their sons & daughters try to remind them who they are, and I barely scrape by the mains ones,and it's particularly maths that gives me a very hard time. And based purely on working my ass and memorizing a little (or a lot) I could conquer 12th (especially with the much easier paper pattern) but no matter how hard I work,I'm just not poised for excellence in JEE. To quote Ralph Cifaretto from the Sopranos, ""I know it's *traaagic* to think this way,but you can't argue with the fucking logic!"".

But yeah,I'm still gonna have to get some mud on my face two months from now,and probably more so in the April JEE (no way I'll be getting out of that) and it's gonna keep distracting me from the boards, something which I CAN do good at. I'm busy doing some ionic equilibrium shit right now which I just can't grasp no matter how hard I try,for no reason other than because it's part of the unwritten code for the path in life. FML.

Long story short: My girlfriend might be flying out to India for a wedding, in November, up in Himachal Pradesh. She was just about ready to buy the ticket when she stumbled upon a news story about the zika outbreak that hit Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh last year.

Now she's slightly worried – as am I.

Would you guys say there's a risk here? Or are we being silly?

Our understanding is that there have never been any reported cases of zika in Himachal Pradesh – is that correct? – but even so, yeah, we're slightly worried...

Whoever who has seen congress campaign in Maharashtra, must have observed that they were nowhere to be seen putting up a fight in most of the constituencies due to lack of funds ,diminished morale and senior leaders joining BJP / Shivsena.


I do remember when demonetisation happened most of opposition  leaders in UP were left cashless and were relying on party funds to fight the election.
But just before elections , BSP official bank account was freezed by income tax ,it had close to 107 crores . 
With the money in its primary UBI account under the scanner of the ED and the I-T department, and therefore unusable, the BSP was forced to fight the election with whatever little money it had

I am a beginner at the things I'm doing now but I'm certain I will be able to pull it off once I connect the links in the right order. I have no clue about Indian machinery market, few people(mostly sales agent of these companies originating from the same location) suggested me that the machinery of the kind I require are best available in places like Kanpur, Surat, Coimbatore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Raipur, etc. All I'm getting is mixed opinions from different people and since I cannot travel to all of these places to validate their points, it gets very hard for me to decide what the right option is. Things that matter to me are the build quality of these machines, their standards, and their prices.

I have done little research on these machines. I contacted a few manufacturers from all the places I mentioned. The basic knowledge I gained is the machine is automatic; it packs nearly 250 sachets per minute and costs near to 1.5 lackh including GST in all these places. But I'm not getting serious information about quality and maintenance. All I want to feel at the end of the deal that the money paid off in the right way.

Also, I am told that companies from the northern side of our nation show you a good quality product but while shipping they send a lower quality one. Which if we go for settlement will burn our time and money.

And that is why I turned up to Reddit to gain some unbiased opinion regarding my problem. Even if you are clueless as I’m, but you know someone who has knowledge on this matter please pass my query to them, every insight will be a great help for me.

If you are curious about my product, well, it will be a mouth freshener similar to any other mouth freshener available, but I have tweaked with the recipe and came up with a different one, which is my trade secret.

Also, in the coming days, I will be posting more queries since I'm a noob noob at enterprising.

3449,"I am studying in IGNOU and I can use some help regarding government jobsSo, I am in BA II year (psychology) right now. IGNOU has 2 sessions: July and January. July session duration is like the usual academic duration, like from July 2017 to June 2020 for 3 year degree. 

The January session duration is from January to December, like from January 2018 to December 2020. 

Now, I didn't complete engineering when I could; and my academics was on a hiatus for few years due to personal problems and apathy. So this BA degree is really important to me as time is short due to age limit in government jobs.

I will give final year exams in December 2020 and will hopefully graduate with God's grace getting okayish percentage (got 68.5% in I year). My question is: **what government exams can I apply for in final year before result is out?**

I know I won't be able to apply for UPSC and RBI next year. I have been studying for UPSC since 2017, but I'd be a fool to dangle all my hopes on it and don't want to waste year 2021 too. Plus, final results should be out before Mains exam which is held in Sept-Oct so UPSC 2020 is out of question. RBI requires candidates to be graduates, and usually cutoff date for educational qualification is August of given year. So that's out of the equation too. 

Yesterday SSC CGL 2019 notification was released. They put education date on 1 Jan 2020. So if next year the same routine follows I may be eligible at 1 Jan 2021. But SSC never follows same routine. Moreover, I won't have final year marks just 1 week after the exams.

Unfortunately however the stamp books in which he had stored these stamps were not kept properly by my family and they are in bad shape, although all the stamps are intact - their glue has come off, or is weak but they're in proper shape and their color has withstood the test of time. 

 I want to get this collection of stamps valuated to see if they have any monetary value. 

Would any of you be aware of where I can get this done in India, preferably in either Mumbai or Delhi. I stay in Mumbai but I travel to Delhi often. I can also go to other cities too if required.  

I'll post pictures later as a separate post but there are stamps from countries which dont even exist anymore. Another interesting page is one which is full of Hitlers face - the whole page, with 5 columns and 7 rows is full of Hitlers in different colors. My favorites are the ones from Italy as their stamps are really beautiful depicting different scenes, and so full of color.

3470,"How did you tell your friends and family about your mental illness?**WARNING:** There's some mention of suicidal thoughts but please understand hurting yourself (for whatever reason) is not the answer. If you're not in a good place, just know that things will get better (they always do).

**tl;dr: live in a typical Indian society where mental illnesses are still somewhat stigmatized. The family tried to understand but couldn't. Afraid friends won't be able either (long-time girlfriend couldn't). Not sure how to explain my erratic behavior.**

Hi. Lol. Talking about this feels weird already.

I am cyclothymic (it's a less severe version of bipolar disorder). My family has known that my father has bipolar disorder II and I always thought I was different and that my mental health was, tip-top. 

Well, turns out, it wasn't. 

Anyway, my manic episodes are okayish. I don't go crazy, just get excited and start setting unrealistic goals but the depressive episodes have worsened. Recently (last week), I had a bit of setback in terms of career (nothing major) but a domino effect ensued and by 3 am (Monday night) I was standing on the edge of my first-floor balcony, holding back tears, and thinking if I jump headfirst, I might die.

Yeah. 

Of course, I am not going to do anything stupid. I just really wanted to, that night (for many reasons but mostly because I felt like living is tiring). 

Here's the worse part though. After that little incident, I sat on the stairs and blocked my friends on WhatsApp and then blocked their numbers on my phone. I uninstalled all social media and made sure they couldn't reach out to me.

Today, after two days, I looked at my blocked messages and calls and one friend, in particular, was, you know, worried. A lot.

And it just feels wrong. I want to explain why I am happy and dandy most of the time, cracking jokes, and just being a very happy person but then every once a while, I just vanish (I've blocked my friends before  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ )

So yeah, just wondering how you did it. What was your experience?

**Honestly, I am just looking for advice from people who've gone through what I am going through.**

**Follow-up question:**

To be honest, I am not sure if my illness has progressed to full-blown bipolar disorder II and if it has, I kind of don't want to acknowledge it. I feel like by acknowledging it, I am giving it more power.

I know there's science behind it and I try to control my episodes as much as I can but if you've had depressive episodes, you know it's nearly impossible to be happy or do anything productive.

Who do I talk to? Yes, a therapist would be nice but I don't have the time to regularly go to a therapist, I genuinely don't. How do you handle it? I try to avoid stressful events but sometimes they find a way to you.

**Some extra context**

I also live a different life than my peers (a career + college, they're just going to college) and they've always seen me as a relatively stable, rock of a person when I am really unstable as fuck. I am also aware that everyone has their own problems and while all of my friends (total 5) really do care about me, there's still a chance that they might not reciprocate (either they don't know how to or don't want to). 

thank you.

I didn't bother fighting it and waste my energy for 1rs. Googled a bit about it, deleted my payments from my paystore, and set my transaction alert up to notify me for anything over 1 on that specific account. Today I got an automated call regarding a transaction approval for 16+ thousand. It was an unauthorized transaction from the above mentioned merchant. Fortunately, I was able to decline the transaction and block my card. If it wasn't for my transaction alert setting, I would have to deal with that fraudulent charge. 

I don't know how my card got compromised. I only used it on play store once few years back. And don't use this card for my daily activities. I think there might have been a breach either of play store or the bank.

3669,"Can anyone educate me about contemporary feminsm in India?I am 20M, from a small town, currently studying at a college having students from all around India and different backgrounds. Back in my hometown school, what we learn was just limited to men and women are equal before law, women should also be given education, and so on. But after coming to my college, I feel that feminism now covers a lot of things here and I am so overwhelmed. I often listen to words like *sexism*, *objectification of women*, *misogyny*, and so on in my college. More often than not, when the feminists of my college get angry due to any incident, I am not even able to understand what caused their anger. So, can anyone teach me (or give me resources) where I can learn about these. In particular, I would like to ask these questions:
1) Is misogyny real? Are there men who are really misogynist? Not only straight men are supposed to be sexually attracred towards women, I feel the idea that someone can hate almost 50% of the world's population (women) impractical.

2) Why is sexism bad? Men and women have different requirements, shouldn't treating them differently to fulfill their different requirements be acceptable too?

3) In a recent comment in r/TwoXIndia, I found that someone wanted people to address her as a woman, not female. Why? Also, I have seen the usage of womyn instead of women. Why?

4) @LifeMathMoney (a twitter handle) is hated by almost all feminists. Why should I hate its posts too? Of all the posts I read there, I didn't find any offensive. Perhaps I didn't understand them properly, or perhaps I didn't understand why are they offensive.

5) Why are IT companies doing diversity hiring in which they hire only women? Wouldn't a gender neutral hire in which they get the best candidates be more profitable for them? (I don't think they are doing this to help the women/society because they mostly don't care about the society)",1571805379.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,8

On October 5 when the students were silently protesting the Proctorial department did some manhandling with the students and later issued a show-cause notice. The students started protesting to take back the show-cause notice and to take disciplinary action against the guards who misbehaved with the students. The students protested for 9 days and they didn't listen, they then marched to the VC office with their demands on October 22nd, later that evening the assistant to the VC called some goons they foster to thrash the ongoing protest. The goons were the students of Jamia Millia and some of them were outsiders ( I'm attaching a video link of the goonism of Jamia Administration ), they beat up the students, sexually harassed the girls protesting, one of the students got hurt really bad and is now in ICU ward of Holy Family Hospital. 

Little did they knew that their actions would cause a huge reaction and will result in rather a much more huge protest and the unanimity of the students. I'm here at the protest, the students called for a university strike, the entire university is closed. About 5 thousand students are here at the VC office raising their voices.

My plan right now is to fly to Delhi, spend a few days there, and then head to Punjab and perhaps Himachal Pradesh and Haryana (although I don't know much about those two).

My questions are:

1) Is it inadvisable to go to NW India in the winter?  I'd like to spend some time in the mountains if possible.  I actually really like the cold, but does travelling become difficult because of snow?  Is it possible to go right into the Himalayas in the winter?

2) Could anybody suggest some places to visit it NW India?  Right now, besides Amritsar and maybe Shimla, I'm not really sure where to go.  I'm mainly interested in seeing historical sites (especially from around the Mughals onwards), and I'd also like to see some nature/smaller towns/villages, since last time I spent 99% of my time in cities.  I'd also like to see a few more places that are important to Sikhs besides Amritsar if possible.

3) Very specific question, but is it likely that people in Amritsar will treat me badly because I'm British?  What about if I visit the site of the Amritsar massacre...?

Any advice?

I personally have no problem with crying but getting teary while taking a stand, makes others perceive me as weak.

I usually get teary as soon as I shout at someone angrily or show anger.

I also get teary when I'm confronting someone. I have read about this, that it can signify that I have low confidence or self esteem. But I use to have these, not anymore.

I'm a confident guy now. Not so much, but yeah, average confidence.

Also, if it matters, I cry very easily when I am happy or sad --but I have no problem with this, it's natural to cry. I don't hold back.

3705,"Postpaid connections restored in Jammu & Kashmir but access restricted due to charges levied. 

https://preview.redd.it/zomxrlxj68u31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a3ab26452874731674dd8041f18ef7ee8cd2415

### Tl;dr

As per a press report in the Quint, the communication shutdowns in Kashmir was partially lifted providing postpaid users access to voice calls. However, while having regained access to voice calling facilities are required to clear payments for services over the last two months in order to make use of their services. We write to the DOT explaining why these charges must be waived.

### Post-paid access is back, then what's the problem?

The Quint on October 14, 2019 in a press report by Shushovan Sircar informed that residents of Kashmir holding postpaid connections were given access to their connections after a communication shutdown that lasted over two months. However, although these voice calling facilities were made available, the only way users were able to make use of their subscriptions were if they cleared payments worth two months of shutdown. Further, an update to the report informed that as a ‘special gesture’ Airtel waived postpaid charges for specifically Airtel Thanks customers only.

&#x200B;

[ Airtel to Waive Aug-Sept Dues in Kashmir as ‘Special Gesture’ ](https://preview.redd.it/jgde89td68u31.png?width=688&format=png&auto=webp&s=dcb4e27f84bdad31392a606eaa36eacf9e67ba27)

In light of this targetted application of the waiver, we write to the DOT on the need to provide regulatory directions to ISPs on the waiving of fees charged during the communication shutdown in order for it to be carried out uniformly across service providers.

In our submission we urge the DOT to direct this waiver on the basis for two reasons:

* *Force Majeure*: The communication shutdown is a Force Majeure event where users should not faced with charges levied for services they were unable to use during exigent circumstances. There has been sufficient coverage of the significant amount of economic, physical and mental suffering the residents of Kashmir have experienced and the inability to make user of their subscriptions until they clear payments only furthers this as it continues to disconnect them from their friends and families.
* *Past practices*: In September 2014, Jammu and Kashmir endured severe floods where as per a press report in the Economic Times, affected the delivery of communication services. In response to this, BSNL waived charges period it was unable to provide services much like the current situation. While this sets a good standard, with no direction provided by the DOT to this effect once again creates varying practices amongst ISPs.

The waiving of such charges should not even be an ask but a given. Nonetheless, we still urge the DOT urgently direct the ISPs on the basis of their powers under the Telegraph Act and the UA License Conditions to issue directions to have such charges waived and any payments refunded for the period when the communication shutdown was in effect.

3731,"How have you been treated in regards to menstruation if you’re a woman ?There was a popular post on here about being raised as a traditional girl - and the damage Indian women get from being molded into perfect, obedient daughters and wives. Do y’all have any stories regarding menstruation ?

I remember when I first got my period , I hid it from my mom as long as I could because I was scared. Well, she found out and basically started crying which is not the comforting reaction you want when you’re 10 and terrified about what’s happening to you. 

She was just sad that it had come early and that I was a woman now- apparently early menses means early menopause so you look “old” earlier. I remember it being a family discussion where my dad, grandma, and sister were informed. I came downstairs wearing a pad knowing that everyone knew and I felt so ashamed. 

Tampons were also not allowed “in there” in case they broke the hymen I’m guessing..I was always told to not mess with that part or put anything up there. Of course they made it about them and so I thought my period was we something extremely bad and I felt guilty about it. 

After that they were a lot stricter with my curfew and I stopped playing with the guy I was friends with - I was told I was too old to have that kind of friendship with boys now. 

Religiously, I was also excluded from poojas and going to the temple. It was something everyone knew because I would not be present. 

My mom says she was not allowed to touch me when I was a baby when she was on her period and not allowed into the kitchen. She had to wear silk clothing and sit in another room and eat with separate dishes. She wouldn’t make food for anyone and religious men in my family would tell her to stay away while they did their pooja. 

When she was a child, she would hide her cloth pads from her mom and be ashamed of telling her mom. It was seen as something dirty and not spoken about...don’t know how much of it had to do with orthodox Brahmin purity (which my parents are proud of). 

This treatment of treating women as pariahs and impure has been extremely traumatic for me growing up. I was made to think of my body as this horrible, sexual thing that would tempt men so I had to cover up. I felt like a slut when I started developing curves. It didn’t help that my mom acts like a pure sati savitri who is asexual in front of the kids and an obedient wife ...never grew up knowing what was normal or had anyone I could share my feelings with. 

It took me a long time to stop feeling guilty about my own body and even now it’s hard for me to wear short clothing - which is what my parents want me to wear after complaining I’m not “modern” enough like other girls. Also because I’m marriageable age and have to look desirable to the groom 🤢

 I think religion and culture is actually horrible for Indian women- we’re brainwashed into thinking this treatment is normal. My mom still thinks women should move to their husbands house even though she’s also told me she cried the first few months after she moved after getting married. 

I’ve heard stories of mother in laws making their daughter in law eat on the floor, girl babies being referred to as “rocks” before getting a boy, not being allowed to shout in front of men-all this in my own family. My mother is proud of being Brahmin but when I asked why I didn’t get to have a thread ceremony like my brother, I was told my job was to sit and look pretty basically. 

I don’t know why pain, suffering, shame & tolerance is so normalized for Indian women. And some women like my mother embrace it and love being a martyr and being put on a pedestal. They embrace it and teach it to the next generation. Why ?",1571802562.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,29,134

I'm a German national currently living and working in China. I'm employed at a local subsidiary of a German company (though locally employed, no German contracts). We are now in early stage talks to open a subsidiary in India as well, and I was asked if I would be interested to transfer over and set up operations etc.

Location etc. are not clear yet, they are just preliminary discussions at this point.

Long preface, but now to my questions:

I have adopted a stray dog here, got her vaccinated, chipped, spayed, officially registered etc. and want to take her with me.

Do you have any pointers on what documents are required? 

Secondly, I have a car here in China that works pretty well, nothing fancy (Kia K2, 2016) but solid and still fresh enough.

I have a German driving license + International Driving Permit, and a Chinese license valid until 2023.

Would either of those allow me to drive in India?

Would I be able to drive the car to India myself through any of the land borders? (that would be optional; I could have it transported on a trailer as well, but I'd love the adventure)

Would I even be able to import the car without having to jump hundreds of bureaucratic hurdles?

And just because I know some of you will ask - yes, I'm not afraid of Indian traffic and have been driving there before. I was living in many places with terrible traffic (including Lagos, Nigeria) and am chill as an ice cube about it ;-)

Ah and if anyone knows a reliable trucking company, I've been living in China for a while and have collected a sizable household and would like to bring some with me. Any recommendations highly appreciated!

**Highlights**

* *Background:* Facebook had filed a transfer petition before the Supreme Court seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* because similar petitions for linking of Aadhaar with social media accounts were pending before multiple High Courts. However, during the proceedings, the Madras High Court had actually dropped the original prayer for Aadhaar linkage and shifted its focus to identifying the originator of information on end to end encrypted platforms like WhatsApp.
* *Tamil Nadu’s Surprise Move:* After initially arguing against the transfer, the Attorney General who was appearing for Tamil Nadu said that the State Government was withdrawing its objections to the transfer petition. In light of this, the Supreme Court allowed the transfer petition and directed it to be listed after mid January 2020.

### If there is a Lock, must there be a Key?

The Attorney General who was appearing for the State of Tamil Nadu began the arguments by saying that Section 69 of the IT Act, 2000 and Rule 13 of the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption) Rules, 2009 impose an obligation on intermediaries to decrypt. The Division Bench of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. agreed that decryption was possible and the Government was empowered to seek it because *“if there is a lock, there must be a key.”* However, there was some confusion regarding whether the intermediary had an obligation to decrypt or if it had an obligation to provide assistance to law enforcement for decryption.

### Need for Judicial Restraint

Amidst this, Mr. Shyam Divan, who was the Senior Advocate appearing for IFF, pointed out that the constitutionality of Section 69 and the Rules had been challenged by IFF in another writ petition seeking surveillance reform and the matter was pending adjudication (Read more [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-rejoinder-in-pil-seeking-surveillance-reform/)). He further cautioned the Court against making any observations regarding encryption or the proposed amendments to the IT (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 because these issues have a major impact on the privacy and free speech of millions of Indians. He urged the Court to exercise restraint because any incidental observations made by the Court may be misconstrued as a justification to impose disproportionate restrictions on fundamental rights. He also highlighted that the scope of a transfer petition is very limited and the merits of such complex issues cannot be discussed at this stage.

### Man in the Middle

Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, who was the Senior Advocate appearing for Facebook, stated that WhatsApp could not decrypt private messages shared on its platform because the key required to decrypt the message was only available with the user, and not with WhatsApp. He stated that the obligation under the IT (Procedure and Safeguards for Interception, Monitoring and Decryption) Rules, 2009 was to provide assistance with decryption to the extent possible and it was not an absolute mandate. He further argued that while some of the parties such as IFF were pro-privacy and others like the Government were anti-privacy, social media companies were caught in the middle because some users want their communication to be private and secure while others want the police to have more powers to investigate cyber crimes.

### Plot Twist

After initially arguing against the transfer, the Attorney General informed the Court that he had received new instructions and the State of Tamil Nadu was withdrawing its objections to the transfer. Due to this new-found consensus, the Court allowed the transfer petition and directed it to be listed after mid January 2020. In its affidavit filed yesterday, MeitY has stated that the proposed amendments to the IT (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011 will be notified by 15 January 2020, and the Court decided to wait till then to let the executive branch address this complex policy issue first.

The contest is conducted in the following manner:  


1.They publish parts of an Amazon gift card in 3 episodes, one part per episode and one episode per week, except for the last two digits.  


Whoever emails the code first, will be given the last two digits and thus wins the contest.   


The last video was out today and I won. When I tried the gift card, I only got ₹250.  


  


Obviously they said I could win 'upto' ₹10,000 and this does come under that amount. But they way they advertise made it seem like the amount depends on how soon we mail the code or pure luck. But this can't be right as they were showing parts of the code in each video while saying this. Thus I send them an email asking about this very respectfully.

  


Since I never used an Amazon gift card before, I don't know if they are available like scratch cards where buyers don't know how much it was worth.

  


Anyway, they gave me a rude reply calling me an entitled millennial and suggested me charities to donate the money.

  


Now, technically, they did pay the winner. But I doubt if it's morally honest to advertise false prizes knowingly.

Also, where exactly does this stand in indian legal system? They said we could win upto ₹10,000 but that simply is not true. How can anyone win ₹10,000 when they already brought their ₹250 giftcard!

  


At the end of the day, I did win something. But I think its very unfair to other contestants.

I understand this post might seem silly. But I am just curious what Indian legal system says about this as I have been informed that it's clearly illegal in UK.

4041,"Pakodanomics, Ola-Uber Theory, Box Office TheorySo when the most intellectual people of the country, honourable  Prime Minister, Finance Minister and IT Minister have made comments on the economy, I decided to go around and look in own way. 

***Note****: I am not an economist. I work in the IT sector and have been outside India from last two years.* 

Last week I visited Vijaywada, Andhra Pradesh almost after two years. All my relatives have settled there and once in a while, I make a visit there. To my surprise, I noticed a lot of changes in the way people spend money and businesses going there.

1. **Vastralatha** is a shopping complex in Vijayawada where a lot of wholesale shopping happens. Shop owners get the clothing raw materials (and clothes) from different locations and sell them there. It is almost the first stop for almost most of the clothes/clothing-material after manufacturing. On having a discussion with one the shopkeeper I came to know that his business gone down drastically. Despite Deepawali coming, there is no surge in sales. He says, ***""There is no cash in the market, how will people buy the goods"".*** Just to know more of him, I tried being naive and said that the government is promoting digital transactions and hence cash is less in the market, to which he replied showing a chart with many QR-codes printed on it, ***""I have PhonePe, Paytm, BHIM, Google-Pay as modes of payments still no increase in business after adopting them"".*** I said that maybe Amazon and Flipkart are consuming his business and he should try moving to online. ***""Nothing in online comes drops from air. They also must go from some outlet. I myself have proxies on Amazon and Flipkart""***
2. Vijayawada is almost like a business capital of Andhra Pradesh. A lot of people from neighbouring places come there to sell their products too. Hence a good number of 2-star and 3-star lodges are there in outskirts of Vijayawada. I then visited one such lodge, which is run by one of my friend's relative. I asked him about the hotel business the past few months to he replied, ***""Has dropped almost half in the last six months. Very few come now, and even those who come are unmarried couples.""***
3. The next day I visited a place called **Poranki**. It is outskirts of Vijayawada, almost a town. I like junk food around and generally eat at around 9:00 PM. The junk food stalls are open till 10:30 PM. I went out that day around 8:00 PM and to my surprise, I found almost all the shops closed. After wandering for 15 mins I found a shop where I ordered **Mirpakayi Bajji (***Mirchi Bhajji/ Big Chillies Fried***).** After having two of them I asked stallkeeper why have the shops closed so fast to which he replied, ***""Are you new to this place. It is happening almost from last one year. No one is having money. Those who have are also spending very cautiously. Due to the lack of customers, I am forced to close the shops early""***
4. The next day morning I visited my village from **Poranki**. *(I am sorry, I cannot tell you the village name for privacy reasons).* My grandma lives there. Besides her home, there are a lot of uneducated people who make materials like hand fans, mats, brooms, etc from coconut leaves and straw. They make them there and then go and sell locally or in other towns and cities. The place used to gleam with joy and noise when people used to sit together and stitch mats. All of that was absent. I asked our neighbour why. He replied, ***""There are more than 150 mats in stock not sold. What is the use of sitting and making more of them.""*** People make these products and travel via big share autos generally to towns. Autos are more frequent and easily available. The afternoon I went to our village bus stop, where autos also are parked nearby. I took a share auto and asked the driver about very fewer people at the bus stop.

 I live in a small town and hence I do not have a Vodafone store here. Now what I want to know from you guys is that why in these times of online payments and video calling can’t one have their postpaid be changed to prepaid without a ‘Vodafone Store’.

4056,"Was I wrong ?A little background: 

So as a tradition , my family just a week before Diwali distributes food raw materials to people who have orange Ration card so they can make sweets and other food items which are made during Diwali . Last year it was 1500 people and this year we estimated 1700 people. It’s basically 5-6 hour event where we check the ration card and the coupon . Take the coupon and ask them to collect the raw material . We keep extra raw material because some people come and expect to get raw material but don’t have the coupon. But don’t have coupon. 

So this what happened : 

As we where distributing to people who didn’t have coupon we decided  to close as it was getting late and start the distribution next day . A lady came and said why are you shutting , I want the raw materials now , I can’t come tomorrow. But as a rule we said we will shut it and ask her to come tomorrow but she didn’t listen and rushed to the collection center and as she started to grab things I shouted ( recollecting statement wise ) 
1) you will get tomorrow no matter what 
2) you will get tomorrow no matter what 
3) you will get tomorrow no matter what 
4) you will get tomorrow no matter what 
5) you will get tomorrow no matter what 
6) you will get tomorrow no matter what 

Things change here 
3) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 
4) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 
5) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 
6) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 
7) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 
8) YOU WILL NOT GET TOMORROW  no matter what. 

And we are not going to distribute tomorrow now. 

I don’t get angry very easily but once I get , I used to be very angry but now I control my anger. 

My brother during this whole situation was trying to calm me by saying I shouldn’t have done this in public. , I don’t have any justification for what i have done.

The person gave me my correct address. But thing is I never took the card in 2008 OR never received the card and never used ANYONE's card either. Infact in 2008, I did not even know how to use a credit card.

I recall faintly that very very long back (dont remember the year) I had seen credit card charges in my bank statement but I had complained it to bank saying that I never applied for the card and bank said that it was AMC charge and they had waived it off too. And such charges never came in my statement afterwards.

After few years I even closed my bank account. That time too bank did not ask for any dues either.

 In past 11 years - I never ever got any letter or email or SMS saying that I have to pay 2500Rs. And suddenly I am getting this call.

The guy does not sound to be fraud because he has not threatened me yet to pay. But he asked me to come and meet him some ICICI office (which is not my bank branch) but in any case I am not going there.

I told him that you have my address. Just send me written letter explaining the issue and I will visit nearby ICICI bank and do whatever I can.

But he said he wont send letter but send an email..and asked me to give my email address.. Since I had no way to verify authenticity of that person, I did not give my email address. And told him to send a letter and dont call me again without sending letter and hung up the phone.

So anyone else getting similar call? What action can I take if they continue to call me like this?

I probably dont even have any record of that bank statement.

What if someone got card in my name in 2008 to buy something without my knowledge? How can bank call after a decade WITHOUT ever sending me any intimation to pay?

Anyone has any advice on how to handle this?

Thanks in advance.

TLDR;
Someone called saying thats its from ICICI bank and asked me to pay some 2500Rs credit card charges for year 2008, shown in CIBIL. I have no clue about card and charges. I never ever got any payment due reminder in 11 years.

4091,"I came across the real reason why Jio is going to charge 6 paise/min for calls made to other companies' subscribers10 days back there were many news reports about Jio's plan to start charging for calls that go out of its network. Back then I couldn't find any report which explained why they were doing this. I had assumed that they are doing this to force people to migrate to Jio, probably because they had cheaper data. People had corrected me that data prices are now almost the same.

A few reports came out later explaining the move but they weren't as good as [this one](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/slate/all-you-wanted-to-know-aboutinterconnection-usage-charge/article9833749.ece). In case you missed it, this is the reason:

* Under the current TRAI policy telecom operators pay each other for calls terminating on a different network. This is called Interconnection Usage Charge (IUC). This is payable by the service provider whose subscriber originates the call.

* This is one of the main sources of income for older telecom providers who carry/receive more calls. A large chunk of their subscribers are on 2G, and the network costs for that are higher. 

* Jio wants to get IUC lowered or removed completely as as the number of calls originated by it are more than the calls terminated.

* TRAI is considering bringing down termination charges due to cost efficiency due to the adoption of 4G technology. However only Jio has full-fledged 4G network with others still operating on legacy networks.

* Given the financial situation of other operators, removal/reduction of IUC would be really bad for them.

* The older networks claim that the termination charge is already too low and does not even cover the cost of carrying the call.

Additional info from another report:

> More cracks have emerged in the already divided telecom sector with Reliance Jio Infocomm Ltd in favour of scrapping interconnect usage charge (IUC) from next year, while Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Idea and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd, or BSNL, opposing the move.

> Jio, however, said it believes this rethink to scrap IUC was unwarranted, arbitrary and anti-poor, and not only affects the credibility of the authority, but also sabotages the government’s Digital India mission.

> “Even after considering that 100% subscribers of new greenfield operator i.e. Jio are on 4G VoLTE, 56% of overall subscribers are on 2G/3G networks... Also, 78% of Vodafone Idea’s subscriber base is on 2G/3G despite 4G VoLTE offered by the company and also competition,"" Vodafone Idea said in its comments to Trai

______

**tl;dr**: Telecom companies pay each other money to carry a call from their network to a different one (rate set by TRAI). This charge is a source of significant revenue for most operators except Jio, whose subscribers make more outgoing calls to different networks. Jio wants this charge to be scrapped, others obviously do not want this. So the 6 p/min move is to [pressurise TRAI](https://www.financialexpress.com/opinion/smart-move-by-reliance-jio-others-should-have-emulated-it/1732350/) into removing this charge.",1571729133.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,30,38

I am not sure if this post fits here but have no idea where to ask. If you have a better place to put this, let me know please. 

I am not Indian. I am married to an Indian and live with my husband in an English-speaking country. I have been to India twice. 

My husband’s mother (my mother in-law) is a widow. Her husband recently passed away after health problems. Because of the health problems, her husband didn’t work for a long time so I don’t think they are very wealthy. They live in Uttarakhand.

After my father in-law’s expiry, I began to hear about his brothers disputing land that was divided between the family. From what I know, my mother in-law and my husband are the rightful owners of the land and lived there for a long time but I am not a lawyer nor very familiar with Indian inheritance law so can’t say that for sure. 

One uncle moved land diving posts onto the land that is my mother in law’s. She moved them back. Then he built a wall on her land and she had the wall destroyed. Now I heard that he used cement to block the water drainage on her land. All this was told to me by my husband. I am scared about her safety. Clearly we want my husband’s mum to live with us in my country but due to the immigration laws being very strict now, it may take a long time to bring her here. I am really worried about her safety and don’t know what will happen to her because this behaviour is not normal in my country and I am not sure what length these people will go to and don’t want an elder woman in my family to experience such behaviour. 

I ask my husband what we can do, he says ‘I don’t know’. I want to do something but have no idea what can be done in India or what would be smart to do (without making the situation worse). I am already doing whatever possible in terms of immigration procedures in my country.

How would this situation be handled appropriately in India? In my country we would just call the police and hire lawyers etc. but I understand things are different in India.",1571726393.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,17,38

I don't know if it's sensitive topic. But I know that Government is trying to ban pornography in India. As far as I know, watching porn is legal ( right? ). But Sharing & distribution is a crime. So I would like to ask does it also include art? Like 2D Drawings , Abstract art with a adult ( -ish ) themes. Art that is not targeted to any existing person or group?

Sorry if my question is a touchy topic. But compared to other internet places, Redditors has been more mature. The law is too vaguely defined that I can't understand it. Most people don't want to discuss about it either.

Edit : I'm referring to digital art

Edit 2 : This post is actually because I saw in a news article that before April 2020, Government will require that all Social networks to be linked to Aadhar & will be strictly under surveillance so as to prevent distribution of obscene contents, terrorism, making rude remarks about other people in social media ( like trolls i guess ). So I wanted to know where would I fit.",1571758077.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,65,50

So I work in some shitty private engineering college. Nothing exciting really happens, just same boring assignments, test and Moodle work. God I hate my job, should have gone to industry. At least I would have made some money instead of what they pay here in peanuts. So few days back I got notification that I have been appointed as Presiding Officers in yesterday's assembly election in Maharashtra.


 At first I peed my pants, because my colleague who had worked on last Loksabha election duty had very awful experience and Believe me being Presiding officers is no joke. Presiding Officers are in charge of entire poll station and if anything goes wrong it's on them + there are 100s of forms that you have to fill in and I don't know Marathi either and all of the forms are in Marathi. I tried hard to remove my appointment as private college professor should not be given election duty (as per one Reddit comment), but then I realized they have the authority to give duty to anyone and they threaten me that if I don't report to the duty, they will file police complain against me. that means I have to go.


So I did my duty as Presiding Officer yesterday and it was not as bad as people have told me about. We have reached the collection place a day before election (20 October). we had to wait for 4 hours before getting EVM and VVPAT. I never liked how government officials work but that day it was different. They were working like a well oiled machine. Yet it took us about another 5 hours to reach to polling station. It was a remote tribal village situated on foothills of Lonavala. 


The School in which polling station was located was in horrible condition, broken doors, broken chairs and tables and No water in bathroom. But villagers were nice to us. They offered us food and other things but I had to refuse because we were not supposed to receive any hospitality from locals. Zonal Officer brought us food around at 11 pm that night. After the dinner we slept at around 1 am. Next morning we had to take MOCK POLL before actual polling starts, Mock poll must start at least on 5:45 am in the morning. We woke up at 4 am, bone chilling cold out there and if you ever been to Lonavala, you might know it freaking rains all time. 

Had to take bath out in open, with cold water as we didn't have any water heater. We took the mock poll, all machines were working fine no issue found thank God or I would have to fill another thousand forms /s. Started polling on 7 am no breakfast till 10:30 just some biscuits which my wife gave just in case of emergency. At start it was very difficult for me at but my PO 1 had explained me how to fill forms. I had take count of voting from machine every two hours, match it with manual data.


 To my surprise I didn't fuck up, everything went well. Filled all forms with help of PO2. She translated everything to me from Marathi and I wrote down all data. Voting went well no troubles at all. Few people in the line tried to be rude but being as an engineering college professor I know how to handle the crowd high on hormones and tell them who is the daddy around here. Poll ended on time. and then it was little bad as sealing EVM VVPAT and CU after voting is bit difficult but I had training and saw YouTube videos already. For heaven's sake everything went well after that. 

When we reached back to collection center I realized we were one of few how completed everything on time. Submitted all million forms no mistakes, no errors nothing. I had already given renumerations to my lady polling officials and sent them home before dark. They had been nice to me and I had returned the favor. After completing some other formalities I asked my peon and PO1 to leave. It took me another 4 hours to reach home. 

When I finally reach home it was already 2 am in the morning. My PO1 reached home 4 am in the morning. That was hell of the weekend to start with. But I feel good about being polling official and I really appreciate the work by all those school teachers, peons and other government employee who go through a lot so that we could vote. If I ever get the election duty I would go back again.

EDIT: Kind sir/ma'am, thank you for giving that light bulb thing. I don't know what it is but sounds really cool. 

I have been talking to my friend this morning and I realized many people don't know how elections are conducted. So ask me if you have any questions, I will try to answer if possible. I have read all the materials provided by ECI I could at least answer some basic questions.

4125,"So we are all getting ready to live under one-party rule for the foreseeable future, right? [P]Because that is what it looks like.

Opposition will be limited to states and pockets. They will be allowed to continue, so it still has the semblance of a democracy.

Congress will be kept as an anti national bogeyman that BJP can use to scare its supporters with. It will be kept at precisely that level, and not more. The party has already lost its courage post 2 losses, and Chidu in jail. Do not expect anything from them.

Kejriwal knows this is a dangerous game to play, and will make sure Modi does not think about him a threat beyond the borders of Delhi.

The regional parties have too many skeletons in their cupboards, and if they do not, they can be bought. Like an entire opposition party MLAs were bought in Sikkim. Expect them to fight only in their own states.

Judiciary cannot be counted upon. We have all seen what's going on. What they do might be OK by the letter of the law, but definitely not in spirit.

Media has already given up, to a large extent. A couple of TV channels and some websites will be allowed to remain 'anti-national'. That's important for self deception.

We can see what most of the media is doing - behaving like how radio did in Rwanda before large scale violence.

Lynching is much more effective than large scale riots which attract too much attention. Lynching spreads low level, everyday terror and is always deniable. 

While the economy is slowing down, it is not slowing down fast enough to cause anger against Modi. And there are terror threats and Pakistan to bring in whenever the going gets tough.

Muslims across India are rushing to get their papers in order so they do not get caught in NRC. Not that it would help much. NRC has a political objective, and the actual NRC is just a tool to achieve that.

Even those who think Modi is doing a bad job do not have a leader of the calibre that can take on Modi-Shah. Such a leader takes time to rise, and will be destroyed before he becomes a threat.

So get ready. This is your future.

Once the kid is aware about how to be happy through natural things in minimal resources, how to choose career and what are the political solutions to the problems being faced by countrymen.... I believe this kid will grow up to become a happy adult who does his job properly and knows how to vote in the elections.

That will change everything.

I am an indian from Madhya Pradesh and came to United states for masters and after that started working here itself. 

Its been 6 years and I got a decent work experience and saved decent amount of money. 

In the middle I got married and my wife had to come with me and she also then started working and has 2-3 years of experience in states. 

My parents and my wife's parents and family are all in India. We miss indian culture, food, family , relatives, social life here in states. 

Life here is really good, earning good money (both combined), bought a small house so that I dont waste money on rent etc. But when I think of life in India I miss people. I have heard from lots of people that once they move to USA hardly people want to return back. Given I am thinking of returning I want to hear from vast majority of people here. 

I plan to work in India, my jobs are mostly in north(Noida, Gurgaon) or south(hyderabad/Bangalore). I am interested to move to south instead of north. 

I am in the semiconductor industry and with my wife we expect to make 25+ lakhs minimum per year.

Also when I move I will have cash to buy a house/apartment in cash hopefully. 

So guys please help me point out some pro's cons of moving to india? I know there are some issues in the system in india where it takes a lot of time to get things done and here its easy. 

The pain I am going through here in states is I am on H1B visa and so there is no stability, no freedom to switch jobs easily, restrictions on travel , unable to call parents more than 6 months. We have to plan everything in advance if we wish to travel . I hate all this  and which is why I feel returning back to india with some good finance would be good to start a life.

Private sector telcos can't make profit till BSNL exists as the base price gets fixed automatically based on what they charge the consumers. They have decided to privatize the telecom sector completely to benefit the private players. Talk about irony, Modi government came to power on the pretext of private players being benefited through the 2G scam. Now, this isn't a scam but a blatant takedown of a public sector organization legally to the benefit of private players. As they are in majority they can pass a law to remove any legal challenges. In such a situation we might see [Internet.org](https://Internet.org) kind of schemes come back to life and user may have to put up with high charges and unfair practices.

On the other hand private sector telcos are operating on much larger debt, of which a substantial part is borrowed from public sector banks. **Should the government not recover these private loans first? What if these private players make more losses and are unable to pay back much larger sums than BSNL owes, who will be held responsible in that scenario?**",1571667017.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,2,0

It was the usual 'Can I confirm your order no. ' stuff and then.... when I asked bout the refund. This hadn't ever happened to mr-- he said sorry sir AliExpress never recieved a payment for it. While the site said payment successful and refund processing... This guy said transaction was failed. I had to even send him account statement screenshot. He was adamant of we can't do anything please contact your bank. 

After like a hour of debate.

This guy says sorry sir my bad I looked up the wrong transaction. Your payment is processing and will be refunded within 20 days. 
This guy really scared the shit out of me.

4519,"IWTL How is not choosing to vote a political stance for you?I read somewhere that not choosing to vote can be a political stance.

Although it is legit and I totally get it, I want to understand exact justification if anybody is aware.

Even I don’t go to vote because I am not a native of where I stay.
I really want voting to go online now that every goddamn ID proof that I have of being Indian is interconnected with other IDs, fingerprints, biometric etc. I can’t think of any risks or malpractices if voting does go online backed by proper mechanisms. I really don’t know why no politician ever talks about this. Nobody seems to table bills for this.

So my political stance could be that I want to contribute to the govt. statistics that these many people didn’t (don’t regularly) vote. If they ever dig into reasons, I want them to find out that these people didn’t vote because their names are listed somewhere else and they live somewhere else. And that there is a need of making voting online. This could be my political stance.

I get a holiday when there are elections where I currently stay, but not when there are elections at where I am from. What is the use of the holiday to people like me? I celebrate it just like any other holiday. So, the elitists’ preachings “go and vote; don’t celebrate it as a holiday” appear shallow to me.

I also don’t want to vote for the sake of it. I don’t want to transfer my voter name to the current city so that I can ‘exercise’ my right. Because I think when I am concerned about the state of affairs at my native place, how do I voice my opinion? I don’t want to vote for a local leader of where I stay today.

This  post is not to attack Bald & Bankrupt personally, but I take high  offense that Bald & Bankrupt has gotten away with slandering India  (and Russia) to generate views for his channel on Youtube.

I  don't mind people exposing real scams, because they only help the  country rid of problems, and make it much safer + increase tourism, but  Bald lies about it in order to make it seem worse than it is. Worst of  all, he is caught doing it (referring to evidence in video).

I  do not agree with Bald & Bankrupt not because he lies for views,  but because he is dishonest about what he is doing. A screenshot from  the video shows Bald calling India a \*\*\*\*hole.

I have left [B.tech](https://B.tech) in the 7th semester due to some personal reasons with 13 reappears and a completed Diploma in CSE with 57%. I didn't have an interest in books or theories but I want to do something different and don't want to Govt. or private job.   


while graduation, I started learning Web Designing and made offline websites like W3schools within 3Months in 2015. That time I did not know about how to put online and all.  


Then I joined a night job in my city. There, I was working on Affiliates and Google Adsense. when I came back home and searched about what is Google Adsense and all. Then,  I started to learn digital marketing and do some experiments. I searched for some groups related to SEO, SMM, SEM and joined those groups. I found some clients and earn $10-$100. Its enough for me at that time. 

I continue to learn new skills but in June 2016, I met with an accident and break my knee's ligament. After an operation, 7 months of bed rest I moved to Chandigarh. 

I opened a digital marketing agency in Chandigarh with my FB friend (Now My partner cum bro :P). We got some clients in the first 2 months. We started hiring Ninjas(Now we are the team of 8 Ninjas.). Within 1 year and 6 months, we hit $600K revenue and bought 3BHK Duplex and 1 New S-cross SUV.  Huge thanks to my partner and team who are working round the clock with passion and dedication. Our company is giving a 5% increment every 4 months to employees. 

I personally recommend that in your free time learn something which polishes your skills and command on your weak points.  


Just listen to your heart and do what you love. My parents did not know about my graduation because they are happy. They know I'm earning decent money.  They want to see you happy.

4551,"Indian born Australian asking for career advice and guidance. [NP]Greetings r/India, 

Looking for some advice on my career prospects and so on.

A bit of preamble and context - I was born in India and moved to Australia at a young age. I've been living in Sydney for the past 21 years or so. I'm fluent in spoken Hindi and English. I can read and write Hindi but at an elementary level. I've lived in Bombay and Baroda for a while, caught the local trains in Bombay, and I can eat street food and drink water without getting sick (somehow, lol). 

I recently completed a double degree in Engineering (Chemical) and Science (Chemistry) from a top 50 internationally recognized university, with decent marks. I graduate this year, and I am in my mid 20s. 

I have had very little luck in finding work in my field here in Sydney, or even in Australia. The job market for chemical engineers is cut-throat. 

I have had some experience and internships, but by all measures, I am still at a very early stage in my career and I have much to learn.

I would like to work in India if I don't get an employment opportunity in Sydney, within a few months. I am thinking of moving to India early next year - both for employment opportunities and to be closer with my elderly grandparents. 

As for my experience - I have had a few internships - one with a big 4 consultancy firm, one with a large chemical manufacturer, and some smaller ones here in Sydney. 

Ideally I would like to work in water treatment or pharmaceuticals, or food processing. I am not so keen on O&G or minerals. 

* What is the job market like in India for chemical engineers ? 
* Would a degree from an Australian university be looked favorably upon ?
* What are some good/reputable job sites I can apply through ? 
* Would you advise for / against my goals to work in India ?

* If all else fails, I am very happy to spend time in India in rural / underprivileged areas doing volunteer work or with NGOs such as TeachForIndia.

* Related to the above, what would people think of someone like me doing volunteer work in India ?

* Any good NGOs besides the one I mentioned that you would recommend ?

* At this point in my career I am not so worried about salary, gaining experience and skills is my first priority. 


Your thoughts and input are appreciated.

4558,"Seperating the signal from the noise - which exit polls to follow?Now that elections are over, we will soon be flooded with multiple exit polls from every random organisation. I have been following elections for years. Here is a rating of exit polls on the basis of how accurate they generally are

#The good 

* **Axis MyIndia** - this is the gold standard of exit polls. These guys have a solid track record and are generally extremely accurate. In May,2019 - they were the only 1 out 2  polls to predict the astonishing mandate bjp got. In fact, for 4 days until the results were declared, they were mercilessly trolled by people who claimed their exit poll was inaccurate and completely wrong. The owner of the company actually cried on live TV when the real results validated his exit polls. In past 5 years, they have failed only once - in karnataka. 

* **5forty3**- he / she (don't know) is a Psephologist and one of the best in buisness. He is the second out of the 2 group who accurately predicted 2019 elections. He dosen't do 'exit polling' but has some form of mathematical model which takes a lot of different things as a input. He had an excellent track record until December 2018, when his predictions in Chattisgarh and rajasthan went completely wrong. But he seems to have changed his model and come back stronger. His 2019 elections predictions were dead on. 

* **today's chanakya** - another good player in this area. Generally accurate and reliable. They don't do a lot of show off and let their numbers speak for themselves. They were quite accurate in May 2019 too.

#The okay

* **Republic Cvoter** - they are extremely Conservative in their approach and often state their seat share drastically lower than the final ones. They get the winner right but are conservative in their margin of victory. They generally get their vote share right

* **Republic JanKiBat**- same problem as Cvoter. They get the winner right but are extremely conservative in their estimates

#The bad

* **Times Now VMR** - their predictions are all over the place

* **ABP - Cvoter** : same problem",1571662298.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,5,9

4563,"Coders - need your help!! Let’s help out our government (and future govts) a bit*Please see the linked image*

We all know, we Indians have so much potential. We are one of the first most advanced and most peaceful civilization, dating back to around 3000 BC. We have invented cotton, textiles, weapons, Ayurveda, yoga, languages, surgery and the list continues.

https://i.redd.it/qvsb1wf9vut31.jpg

Since independence, we have achieved great growth and have lifted many people out of extreme poverty. However, this growth has been slow and patchy to say the least. Our current government is resolute however slightly clueless. Topics like economy, health, education are extremely tricky to solve for a massive and diverse state like India.

We need to create a repository of ideas, and have the best minds of the country (IAS, professors of national institutes, researchers, economists, students) discuss the ideas and assist the government in prioritizing which policies to implement.

I dream of creating an invite only platform for such people to submit and discuss the ideas and policies. I want our country to move away from discussing politics and religion. I want our narrative to change towards ideas and policies that can help propel this extremely capable nation of 1.3 billion people to a brighter future.

I have attached a mock-up of how I envision the portal to look like. Key features:

* Sign up using Aadhar OTP
* anybody can view the discussion but to vote, comments and engage you need to sign up
* initially invite only for the best minds in our country
* people can submit ideas
* ideas segregated in a manner our central cabinet is segregated
* politics and religion agnostic discussion
* No advertisement

I haves full time job however I am extremely passionate about India and this cause. I am looking for people who can make this vision a reality. I need people who can code, I can myself do the designing (photoshop) and assist with the setting side of stuff. I need people to help me in marketing the platform as well to top minds of our country.

Anybody who cares for this and believes in this, please comment and DM me

I have decided that I will have to go to coaching classes for JEE. Even gave entrances and got good scholarship. Now the question is whether I should take their tie up program or not. The coachings have a tie up program with dummy schools who will take care of attendance and I have to go there only for practicals and exams. I am a bit unsure of this, my inner voice is saying to not go to these tie ups, they are very bad but my brain is saying to go else I won't crack JEE. The main problem is that all these tie up colleges are with Maharashtra board and the coachings are forcing me to take subjects like P.E and E.V.S which I hate. If I were to go to a regular school I would have taken PCM and CS in a CBSE school. So should I go for these dummy schools? What was your experience with them especially in Mumbai?

So few weeks ago I came to know that my father is having an affair with a college girl, gives her money and resources and had been physical with her too.
So I decided to collect proof like call details, chat history, call recordings, photos and videos shared so that if he happens to delete any of those I have them to make my point in front of my mother.
She's here for Diwali for couple of weeks and now I can't wait to tell her every thing however I am unable to. I don't know where to start, I'm unable to collect the courage to tell her, I'm afraid it could lead to something very bad like break up the family or she hurts herself (she's very emotional).

4652,"You guys I have problem relating to my neighbours at the back of my house that I want help with.So the house behind my house has a servants room at their back side in which they have a servant that lives with his whole entire family.

A husband. A wife. A daughter and a son.

I don’t know how old his kids are. But his daughter definitely looks like she is old enough to be going to school and his younger son also looks like he is old enough to be going to some kind of pre school also by now.

BUT the problem is that it doesn’t matter what the time of the day it is since 2018. All I CAN HEAR CONSTANTLY AROUND THE FUCKING CLOCK LITTERALLY. 

AND I AM NOT EXGAERATING. LIKE HONEST TO GOD. I SWEAR ON EVERY HOLY SCRIPTURE AND MY OWN LIFE TOO.

All I FUCKING HEAR IS THESE FUCKING CHILDERN MAKING NOISE ALL AROUND THE FUCKING CLOCK!!!!!!

LETS SAY THEY GO TO SCHOOL ON THE WEEK DAYS. THEN YOU WOULD SAY THAT FROM AROUND 7-8 AM TO 2-3 PM THERE SHOULD BE PEACE AND NO NOISE IN THIS SPAN OF TIME.

BUT NO THAT NEVER FICKING HAPPENS

THEN LETS SAY THAT THESE CHILDREN HAVE A BED TIME AT NIGHT AND SHOULD GO TO SLEEP BY LETS SAY 10 PM AT NIGHT.

BUT NO!!!!

5 DAYS BACK THESE FUCKING BITCHES WERE MAKING A RACKET AT THE TOP OF THIER LUNGS PLAYING AND FLOICKING TILL 12 AM AND PAST IN THE MIDNIGHT!!!!!


I AM SO FUCKING SICK OF THESE CHILDREN

LIKE IT LITERALLY DOES NOT MATTER WHAT THE TIME IN THE DAY IS THESE CHILDERN ARE SHOUTING AND MAKING NOISE AT ANY GIVEN TIME IN A 24 HR DAY!!!!

AND I AM HONEST TO GOD NOT EXAGERATING ONE BIT HERE.

Bc before you people think that I’m some kind of a villain that is just hating on little children for no reason I just want you to know that I am not a person that normally gives a fuck about people or children or senior citizens.

Like l don’t care and I don’t give a fuck if they are men women old people or children 

I am not person who has biases to any class of people 

But THESE CHILDERN in the back of my house ARE SERIOUSLY SO ANNYOING.


THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY MAKING ME RANT ON REDDIT ABOUT HOW I CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM?????

LIKE I AM ABSOULTY CLUE LESS ABOUT WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO DO ABOUT THEM?

Like what can I do about them if there is anything that I can do about them?

Is there ANY kind of action that I COULD take against them????

What are my options in dealing with these kids????

I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but here goes. 

I am currently working abroad, and have a PF account from when i used to work for an IT firm in India. 
I have been filing my IT returns even though I am working abroad, since there are some stock purchases that I make occassionally. 
The place where I need help is fields which ask estimated income for declaration, and total estimated income. I also need help in understanding the difference between assessment year and previous year. 
The last IT returns I filed was for 19-20. I didn't mention any income on my returns since i was not working in India, and O kept my remittance below 50k per month. As per my understanding, there is no tax deductions on remittances.

Met many indians from different areas.
I really like you guys and your history and rich cultures, amazing nature and the most peaceful people I ever met.

That aside , I found myself very curious at the kashmir issue ( don't really know how to call it)
I traveled in jammu and kashmir, and saw alot of troops and soldiers every corner.
I know it a territory issue in general.

I also met kashmiris around india , and they seem to get along and be part of the locals where I saw them (outside of kashmir) so I take it that you get along , so what I would like to understand is what is the average normal guy in india thinks about this ?

It was founded in 2011 and recently raised over 600 $ million in fundings. So Flipkart and Amazon and other ecommerce giants employ these fuckers as their 3rd party courier servie. I had ordered a product through flipkart on 2nd of october. Unfortunately this delhivery fuckers were supposed to bring my product. I was supposed to get the product on 16th october. On 17th october I recieved a call from the delivery agent , he told me he would come tommorow. Next day I didnt recieve any call so I called them in the evening. Guess what that sleazy bastard told me ? He said his legs are injured he cant make it and he will come next day. Next day on 19th I again dont recieve any call so I call him again. This time that scammer said he had tried calling me in morning but my phone was switched off. My phone is literally never switched off. I told him when you gonna give me the product now. He said he has returned the product because of not reaching me. 🤐🤐🤐 I had to eagerly wait nearly for 3 goddamn weeks just to finally not have my products. I have shopped over a lakh worth of product through flipkart but never faced such problem because delivery was always made through ekart their inhouse delivery service.I researched further about these sleazy bastard And realised this fuckers have the worst delivery service.literally everyday these fuckers get complaints about lack of delievery . Then complains about lack of customer support. Others people had the exact same problem like the agent refusing to deliver and finally cancelling the delivery himself without customers permission .Have you guys faced such problem with Delhivery courier company ?

I have stopped following a lot of people because of their back to back negative perspectives and rants on everything happening in India. They cite sources that are fake 90% of the time, they just share what resonates with their thoughts without even thinking or confirming the truth behind all these fishy news, blindly believing in them. There was a time I use to enjoy social media when people were posting funny pictures, positive thoughts, there were less opinions and more genuine social media updates. Now it's like everybody picks a contraversial matter and posts about it. What happens next, people debating, writing spontaneous thoughts, no filter as such, because you don't have to interact with that person in person. There is no confrontation, you comment, you post and that's it. There is no healthy one on one conversation where you are sensitive about other people's thoughts. I am not saying that people shouldn't debate on the issues of the society but I am against using a virtual platform to communicate such feelings/agendas especially on Facebook or instagram, lol. It's a freaking social media platform for god sake, you stay connected with your peeps, share memes, post your life stories and that's it. Use freaking reddit where there are community just for such intense discussion where people actually go and verify sources and not freaking post any shit.

Flipkart will automatically apply the Premium Trial offer on it, not allow you to remove it and also not allow you to select another offer.

The T&C of the YouTube premium trial offer explicitly states  that no other offer providing cashback or discounts can be clubbed with the offer.

Explaining this to the customer support was another pain in the ass. Firstly the support guys were very inept and to my best attempts I was still unable to explain the above even with screenshots when I attempted to contact them through the chat.

Every message or response during the call was followed by a minute or two long pause sometimes even 10 minutes (chats only) where he/she would presumably look through a list of replies/resolutions being unable to find any and then ending it up with ""I am sorry but I am unable to help you with the problem""

My previous purchase for Minecraft Java edition also went awry with the seller sending me a pirated copy with a key that was leaked back in 2012 , the product was under flipkart's recommended on the front page and getting my money took me over a month.

On the contrary Amazon has always provided competent customer support even to non-prime members.

Do note, that I have Flipkart Plus too.

* Some voting centres do not allow electronic gadgets inside with you while casting your vote. Also, they often lack amenities to store your electronics safely. So, either leave your electronics at your home when going out to cast your vote , or leave it in the car (if you came in one) or leave it with a friend or relative while you go inside to vote.

* Carry a water bottle with you to drink water. If you have to wait for some time due to some technical issues, you should be equipped with water to save you from the  Mumbai heat.

* The election officials, police working in the voting center are ordinary people like us posted on election duty. They have a lot of work before and after the voting finishes. **Be polite to them and don't be an asshole**.  They want to get the voting done as smoothly as possible too

* If you do not have a voter Id card, you can use any of the following identity  documents for casting your vote

4855,"PSA: Never use GoDaddyUpdate:

Tweet with the link, I would appreciate it if it is retweeted to create awareness:[https://twitter.com/Varun08534985/status/1186225487049179136](https://twitter.com/Varun08534985/status/1186225487049179136)

I have a dedicated server with GoDaddy that I use to host simple wordpress sites. One day I randomly decided to log into the server to check one of the sites and realized that I was unable to access the hosting. After sometime with tech support I was able to log in only to realize that my entire data was wiped clean. At first, the tech support tried to blame this to some ""hacking"" incident but when I kept asking for details such as the method of hacking, ip addresses used and other info, they reluctantly opened a support ticket. A day later they came back with a response saying that there was a problem with the server and they were moving the data which they lost somehow. They lost 25 sites that were hosted and didn't even offer an apology.

I called tech support again and they said that it was my fault for not keeping backups. When I asked for a refund for the hosting let alone the loss of data, the customer service representative asked me not to act ""smart"" as they are not responsible for anything.

&#x200B;

Strangely enough I get around 5 emails from these GoDaddy spammers about their new products and renewals everyday but they did not have the courtesy to inform me before they moved my data as well as when they screwed it up. I guess it was meant to be a surprise for me.",1571612547.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,143,1012

4862,"[NP] Victory against Amazon Cash on Delivery system for once.Well there are those moments sometimes when customer is right, which the delivery boys took it for granted. 

I ordered a product which cost 699, and mode of payment was COD. The date of arrival was today October 20, so naturally I had my cash ready and I was expecting them sometime after 12 pm or so, knowing they usually deliver at that time.

What I didn't expect that the deliver man pressed the doorbell sometime around 8:00 Am, waking up my kids who with difficulty woke me up. Papa.. Amazon guy is here. Ok, no problem, I asked my kid to hand over that two 500 notes to him and receive the pack and collect the 300 change in return. The guy refused cuz he had no change and it is his first delivery.

Then I went to the door to deal with him and told him to provide change and come back, it is not my problem cuz I opted for COD and there is no clause mentioned there that for a customer to provide exact amount for the product you buy. He pleaded at first that he has no change and I use card payment or UPI, to which  I told him boss that is not my issue, if you are to deliver a package you have to carry a change. And I opted for COD, I don't think I have much to say here. I didn't ask you to deliver at 8 am, you did out of your convenience, and now about my convenience, I don't have a change and you have to give it to me. 

He gets agitated and calls his manager and tells him that I am refusing the payment after taking up the package. Woah...slow down there mate, I am having cash on my hand with me, I tried to give it to you but you refused cuz you do not have the change. Don't twist shit to save your ass. Then he gives his phone to me so I speak to his manager. Of course, as if I am not a manager too, eh? The manager tells me the same shit the deliver guy said and I interrupted and told him that I have opted for COD, your junior here has no change and to put it better he came to conduct  business at my door unprepared and unprofessional. Amazon didn't ask me to carry exact amount, so now that's your issue not mine. To which he says to give him the 1000 bucks and he will return me back the change later, I plainly refused of it cuz of trust issues. He ( the manager on phone) tells me to return the package then and he will come back again, to which I plainly refused again citing that it is my package now, you refused to take the money in exchange and you're playing with me.

To which the manager is ofcourse pissed as a customer didn't provide him the first cash of the day, he tells me I can't do that, I will put you on a block list, I will file police complaint for keeping my package blah blah... And with a laughing tone I told him, please I want you to do the very exact thing I have in my mind right now, you are saving my time to call the cops. Here I am with 1000 bucks on my hand, offering to exchange, your guy refuses to take the cash, because he is unprofessional and you're here arguing with me to play by your rules, when the package itself does not say ""Amazon Prime"" anywhere from top to bottom and side ways. This carton box of delivery says ""Good Knight"" liquid repellant thing used for supply chain. So I doubt whether you're from Amazon or somebody else, and I think this could be an Explosive. So go ahead and call the cops ""Madarchod"". He says sir mind your language.  I told him Bhosdike, you spoiled my morning showing up at 8 am unprepared and you're threatening me instead of solving this issue yourself and I should be polite? (kids were on another room, I was sure)

Now that he got real worked up and said ok sir, we will put you on block list and call cops. I said go ahead but don't think I am some chutiya as well. This whole deal is a sham and I don't think Amazon would like that the way you handled it when I'll drop a law suit to them over a weird situation. I have 5 points where you fell weak, so be careful of your next step.
The delivery guy listening to the whole thing in front of me was blank face, he took his phone back and left without anything. I went back to my sleep.

10 minutes later, there is a doorbell ringing only this time I answered half expecting cops maybe. Lol no, the same delivery guy returned back with 300 rs and made the exchange with my 1000 rs without a word. And safe to say the package didn't contain any explosives. But I did comment on the review section later about this whole thing.",1571545429.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,33,0

4987,"An Interesting Report on Child Malnutrition by Arvindhttp://www.indiaenvironmentportal.org.in/files/file/child%20malnutrition%20India.pdf

Seems like even the best performing states by HDI in India is struggling in child malnutrition.

The conventional vital health statistics in Kerala are the highest among all Indian states and rival those observed in China.
Among the largest 17 Indian states, it ranks fourth in terms of
per capita income. In terms of per capita income, Senegal and
Mauritania are among the better-off countries in Sub-Saharan
Africa but both lag behind India and Kerala with the gap being
especially large with respect to the latter.

 Senegal, which has 4.25 times the infant mortality rate of Kerala, almost six times Kerala’s underfi ve mortality, and 4.3 times Kerala’s maternal mortality ratio,
has lower rates of stunting and underweight children. Children in Senegal, better nourished as per malnutrition estimates, die at rates many times those in Kerala. A comparison
with Mauritania yields the same picture.

1. How important is competitive programming for cracking the interview at these companies? I feel like I'm too late for this at 7th sem.

2. Is daily Leetcode practice good enough? Do I need to participate in competitive coding challenges?

3. Do off-campus placements require more specialized skills than on-campus?

4. How do I even get called for interviews at these companies? I've no referrals or alumni who can refer me.

5. I have a few projects on web-dev, python, machine learning (they're decent but not spectacular) but no accomplishments barring CTC by digit magazine. How do I improve my resume?

5035,"My first date !Last week i posted here asking for tips for my first date. I got a few responses and it actually helped. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. 

So, as a single virgin 20 year old i was tired of just watching porn and jerking off. Out of all the people my beautiful mother suggested me tinder ( me and my mom are really close and open with each other ). So i installed tinder and just swiped right on ever single profile without even looking at their pics or bio. Honestly i didn't expect to get a single like. Eventually i matched with this cute chick who also happened to live nearby. We chatted for 2 days. I really wanted to meet her now so i just asked if she would hang out with me. She said yes. I never felt so excited before. We made plans and everything and now came the day of the date. I got ready and went to the meet up place. I was patiently waiting for her. After about 10-15 of waiting there she was wearing a blue crop top and cut out jeans. She was a solid 10. We went for dinner and drinks. I was very shy and couldn't come up with anything to talk about. She made me comfortable and i finally opened up with her. We talked about i don't know how many things. So, our dinner was over and i really didn't want her to go just yet. I was having the time of my life. I suggested her if we can chill at my place for sometime and then i'll drop her home. I wasn't expecting her to say yes but she did. Now, i wasn't thinking about getting physical with her on the first date. I really started to like her and wanted to go on a couple more dates with her. So, we reached my place.  I introduced her to my mom they had a small chat and then i took her to my room and closed the door to have some privacy. Not 2 minutes later, my mom knocks on the door. I open the door and she hands me 2 snicker bars and a CONDOM. I did not expect that and thankfully my date didn't notice it. I hid the condom in my cupboard and we started chatting again. We talked for about 30-40 minutes. Now i started to get a little horny. We were touching each other all the time but it was in a friendly manner. I thought to myself this can be my first and last oppurtunity with such a pretty girl. So i gathered up all the courage and just asked her if i can kiss her. She said yes. Now i had never kissed a girl before. I also told her about that. So i just pecked her on the lips. She was like thats it ? I didn't know what to say or do. Out of nowhere she comes closer to me and starts kissing. Tongue and everything. Now i was really hard. Now i am on top of her kissing her like this is the last time i am going to kiss a girl. I started to take my hands towards her breast but she casually slapped my hand and said lets take it slowly. Honestly i was a bit disappointed but i didn't want to take it further if she wasn't interested. So we kept making out for almost like a hour. My mom then made some brownies. We ate the brownies and she asked me to drop her home. I dropped her home, she gave a peck on my lips and off i went to my home. When i came home my mom started asking me how it went and all that. I just told her nothing happened we just talked. She wasn't believing me so i showed her the condom. She then asked if we didn't even kiss so i said we made out for a bit. She was like 'my boy' and patted my shoulder. It's been a week now and we are talking every day for hours and hours. My next date with her is on monday. I think i am falling for her. I haven't been this happy for a very long time. Sorry if this was long but i really wanted to share this. :)",1571566915.0,#5093d6,Non-Political ,dark,79,17

Next morning on 19th the app started to load without an error but I was unable to link my aadhaar card in the app. The app continued to say something went wrong and never let me link my card.

5277,"Software/CS Career AdviceSo, I have posted on here before : (I think the spam filter is picking up links that I post here)

Check the above link if you need a little backstory. If you don't want to read it, it's okay because this thread is a little different from the above one.

So I'm currently in my final (3rd Year) in a private college in India, and have been placed in a company already. Majority of the positions here were non-technical (as well as mass recruiters), but I am still hopeful of something better to come.

If you read the above thread, I just want to tell you some of the things I've done during the year since I posted :

* Wrote code, as much as I could.
* Pushed some code on GitHub
* Built a portfolio, a resume.
* Tried getting into competitive programming (Failed, hate it. Did learn a few algorithms through a course though.)
* Tried contributing to open source projects. (Failed, maybe didn't try hard enough. Seemed too overwhelming.)
* Have been learning more and more about different subjects in CS, whether on my own or through college (Mostly on my own), through MOOCs, books, etc.
* Tried getting an internship in the summer. (Failed, got ghosted a few times by recruiters, many didn't even respond.)

So I am currently trying my best to get internships for winter. I think that right now, it's my best bet. But it's difficult, like really difficult. So my problem now is different from the last post I made. Last time I was more confused about learning things, but now my problem is actually getting into the industry.

I would appreciate any guidance from experienced people in the industry, on how to network, how to actually properly apply to internships, how to improve my profile perhaps, how to get and prepare for interviews, and things I should/should not do. I hate to ask for referrals, but hey, even that would help me. Just let me know and I'll drop you my portfolio and resume link.

Thank you :)

I'm hoping to find or potentially organise a group in New Delhi of people interested in either playing or learning more about Dungeons & Dragons. I played D&D for roughly 4 months last year so I'm familiar with the basic game flow and rules. If we are able to organise a group of very motivated players, I might even consider DMing even though I'm not familiar with the game nor comfortable enough doing so.

I've created a discord server specifically for people in India interested in D&D (and potentially other tabletop roleplaying games) to try and expand this gaming scenario in our country. Even if you have no experience whatsoever or aren't from New Delhi, do hit me up on discord or over here and I'll add you to the server. I can help you learn the game.

My dog is an Indian mongrel. Before adopting him I had asked the permission of my house owner. He was okay with me raising a dog. He never mentioned any rules about pets not allowed or anything. So when I found a pup in the neighbourhood streets I picked him up and I have been raising him for the past 3 months. He is 4 months old now and still adjusting to the rules. Though he is a well behaved dog most of the time he tends to howl sometimes(only during the day and when I'm not at home  he doesn't make any noise at night). He doesn't bark or bite and the only problem is his infrequent howling(4-5 times a day). As I'm working during the day I leave him at home alone. My neighbours already discriminate as I'm the only bachelor living in the apartment(People never invite me for the apartment events or anything). And once my dog came into picture, I'm being constantly harassed. The neighbours never said anything about apartment rules and now all of a sudden a rule has popped up stating 'No dogs' are allowed.

I've been working in Chennai for the last one and a half year (first job outta college). In-hand salary is 36k and being in Chennai, and that too in a team as the only north Indian has been challenging. Also I didn't conduct myself as a no-nonsense professional and have given that team of tamilians reasons to joke about me, that too in their own language. They're not bad folks at all, but I feel really suffocated, and have only one friend at the workplace, who  is leaving in 20 days. 

Also the team is severely understaffed, and I need to code for 7 hours everyday which is taxing mentally. We're working on a project that'll be delivered in march. I'm currently on job hunt, and may land a few interviews in November. Now this project is very crucial for my company, so if I quit by say January mid, my tenure will be over around March-mid (60 days notice period), just before the delivery of the project. I'm afraid of a huge reaction from my team in that case, and it's triggering my anxiety. But also I'm really suffocated here working like a machine, and I wanna get out as soon as possible.

Due to the latest Hong Kong protests, China's image has been deteriorating. (From what I have read on r/China) . People are beginning to realize that Chinese government values money and censorship more than basic human rights (Case in point : High levels of censorship and Alleged Genocides against Muslims)

However , multinational companies don't give a shit about this , since they have invested millions and billions of dollars into Chinese Market. Thus they would do anything to keep China's government (CCP) happy. After reading about Blizzard and NBA controversies, a strange thought came to my mind.

Is there anything India can do ,so that amidst all this chaos, some of the MNC might look up to India as substitute for China ?

1) With our population comparable to that of China's, MNCs would be able to flourish just like they did there
2) Even though we joke about how our films are highly censored , it's not as bad as China (Which I agree is a terrible benchmark)
3) With our economy slowing down , this could be a silver lining
4) With people ""boycotting"" MNCs for their Pro-China (Anti-HK / Pro-censorship) , MNCs are likely to transition into less controversial relationships


I know that I have discussed only positive side of this whole thing. Feel free to comment your views and counter views

I know that we cannot start a trade war with China openly. Perhaps some good incentives for MNCs ? Just a food for thought

Besides all this, What are your views regarding the HK protests ? Or about China's growing influence on the world ?

For the past few days, I've been having liquidy stool with lots of bile around 4 times per day. It seems to be getting worse too. I don't eat much in the way of fats, and the only oil I use for cooking is ghee. I've done some research that's led me to believe that it may be something to do with bile malabsorption. I've found no treatments for it though. 

I've had a sinus infection for the past few days as well and there's been mucus in my stool (likely as a result of swallowing a lot of mucus), if that makes a difference. 

Any ideas or advice on what this might be or possible treatments would be really appreciated.

When TRS(Telangana Rastra samithi) won for the first time in the new formed Telangana state, everyone in Telangana thought there will be better state and yet no one foreseen failures of government and state.

Recently, I read newspaper which really made me sad. TSRTC employees was doing strike for last fifteen days and yet government was not caring for the public or for the employees. So called chief minister of Telangana state releasing statements that all the employees who went on strike are self-dismissed. There were suicides, and I still didn't understand how 50,000(approximately) employees will get self-dismissed in corporation sector. All the employees are on roads from all departments and yet government was not caring. All they took measures is by declaring holidays for educational institutions and schools. High court warned government to discuss the problems with employees union and yet government didn't give any response or respect. I heard about Monarchy and recently I read about that situation in Telangana. There are many issues to be resolved but no one in the government giving shit about it as they have a huge majority.

Governor may, can nominate one Anglo Indian community for Legislative Assembly of the State.Article 333 of the Indian constitution deals with Representation of the Anglo Indian community in the Legislative Assemblies of the States.
Notwithstanding anything in Article 170, the Governor of a State may, if he is of opinion that the Anglo Indian community needs representation in the Legislative Assembly of the State and is not adequately represented therein, nominate one member of that community to the Assembly.

I am not able to find more but someone said there is 2 seats reserved for Anglo Indian in Parliament too. President can appoint there.

Anglo-Indians are the only community that has its own representatives nominated to the Lok Sabha (lower house) in India's Parliament. This right was secured from Jawaharlal Nehru by Frank Anthony, the first and longtime president of the All India Anglo-Indian Association. The community is represented by two members. This is done because the community has no native state of its own. 14 States of India; Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal also have a nominated member each in their respective State Legislative Assemblies.

The reserved seats were expected to have been phased out by the 1960s, but have continued to be renewed by successive governments, and are up for renewal in 2020.[2]

Getting to the question, I'm an agnostic atheist but I've always respected every person's belief system. With BJP making India pro-Hindu through its policies and moves, it feels wrong for some reason. I get that India has a Hindu majority. I'm a part of it. But seeing the minorities being pushed out slowly is fucking with my mind. 

My family has this mentality that India belongs to the Hindus (it should belong to its citizens). I've heard them say pretty terrible stuff (especially recently with the Ayodhya dispute). I've been feeling pretty conflicted lately and I don't know what side I'm on.

Something like a indian Joe Rogan Podcast. I'm aware that some exist but i want to take it beyond the confines of the indian border to brown people everywhere. My question being is there an actual market for this or is it just a dead end?

How long does the original filter last?

Any cheaper options from others service centres?

5868,"Frequent traveler visa refusalHi Reddit,

I and my husband applied for a schengen visa with the French embassy in Bangalore, India.

Our plan was to visit Paris for 10 days and spend the time entirely doing touristic things and sight seeing. We have submitted all necessary documents along with hotel and flights. However after submitting the application, our hotel was cancelled due to the fact that they don't accept debit cards but only accept credit cards.

So at the time of visa processing the hotel accommodation we had given was already cancelled. Could this be the exact reason for refusal? The reason embassy gave is:

""The information submitted regarding the justification of purpose and the conditions intended to stay were not reliable"".

I have previously obtained a schengen visa and i have also traveled to many countries including USA, UK etc. This is my first visa refusal and I can't help but think it's strongly due to the hotel cancellation.

Should we immediately reapply with a new hotel accommodation? Or should we just wait and try another time?

Thanks.",1571382425.0,,Politics,dark,4,14

5881,"r/Futurology meetup - Bangalore Chapter on 20th Oct 2019 UPDATE !!*Namaskara!*, We are hosting the official [r/Futurology](https://np.reddit.com/r/Futurology/) meetup here in our city. This is part of a global meetup that is happening in cities all over the planet. Everyone interested in meeting up and discussing what the future holds for us is welcome.

Here's what we'll be doing:

* After introductions and you have let people know why you're so excited/unhappy with the future, you can split into smaller groups or stay in the main group depending on group size. Make sure you try to meet everyone though.
* Once in your group, you can start discussing and debating the following topics in any order you choose stating your pros and cons for it.  

   * Do you believe we are heading towards a utopian future If yes/no, why?
   * Do you think AGI/BCI(Artificial General Intelligence/Brain-Computer-Interface) will happen? If yes, when?
   * What's your preferred solution to the Fermi Paradox?
   * When will we land on Mars?
   * What's our city's elevation relative to the nearest coastline? How badly and how soon will floods from sea-level rise over the next decades affect us?
   * Will AGI/BCIs be able to solve the looming climate crisis?
   * Do you prefer AGI or BCIs?  

      * Basically, would you trust an Artificial Intelligence that is a thousand times smarter than humans without any human intervention? Would you trust every action that AGI takes?
      * Or would you prefer a human who has been enhanced by a computer to higher intelligence levels, but also carries the baggage of personal emotions and preferences?
   * We shall select a bunch of crowd sourced questions from google forms that isn’t part of the list or any questions you can come up with!!
   * We will pick out a place that will serve food and drinks. You will have to buy your own food and drink.

If you're unfamiliar with any of the topics that come up in the discussion, no worries, just ask the person who brought it up. It's always good to learn something new. Do some prior research on your own if you'd like to learn more. This meetup should be a great opportunity to learn new stuff and the bleeding edge of research across several industries.

Pls RSVP for the event on [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyn8xI475FWEicjnb\_WaCOlmoaGiOBcGc\_ikcT0QJ3\_B0OBg/viewform?usp=sf\_link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyn8xI475FWEicjnb_WaCOlmoaGiOBcGc_ikcT0QJ3_B0OBg/viewform?usp=sf_link)

5885,"How is Oyorooms growing its valuation so quickly?Let's be honest, Oyo has seen the rise of the likes that every company dreams of. It is consistently hiring new people, opening in new continents, countries, and cities across the world. It was last valued at $10Bn by its founder in the stock buyback program. Softbank has invested huge sums in it and by all means, the company is not looking to decelerate its expansion plans. What's surprising is that I haven't met a single guy in my life who has had an ""Out of the world"" experience with Oyo. Sure some people have had decent stays for the price that they have paid but there are mostly complaints from people about how Oyo screwed up their plans, how Oyo's customer care never responds and no one is ready to help them out. So what is going on? Is Oyo another bubble that is just getting more and more money by showing numbers and not focusing on the service quality? Seeing the WeWork fiasco and protests by hotels in multiple cities, I somehow feel like it is going to burst in a year or 18 months.

I was quite good at my job (it was easy for me), liked the people I worked with and made good money. But I didn't enjoy what I was doing, to the extent that I began to hate it. Outside work, I found great interest in screenplay writing. I had been writing for over 6 years, pitching and sending my work to production houses, contests etc. and a few months back, was selected to be part of a big TV network's writing program, at the end of which, they would hire me as a writer for their TV shows based on my performance during the program. 

I quit my cozy 8 year old job and took the risk. 2.5 months into the 7 month program, they did not find my writing to be good enough for them and let go of me.

**Highlights**

* *Background:*  On August 1, 2019, we wrote to the NPCI indicating concern and also suggested a few points of action with regard to the TrueCaller security breach that occured on July 30, 2019. Within no time, we received a response that an investigation was being conducted on the issue.
* *New update*: With almost two months since the incident, we thought it was necessary to check-in with the NPCI to enquire about the action and outcomes taken after the security breach.

### Background

On 30.07.2019, media reports and various user complaints brought to light an issue that caused the automatic registration of unified payments interface (UPI) based IDs of Truecaller users without their knowledge and consent. We wrote to NPCI indicating concern and suggesting immediate and intermediate action ([**read more**](https://internetfreedom.in/true-caller-or-false-caller-we-ask-ncpi-to-answer-this-question/)) and they informed us of two steps they took in response, firstly, that they had stopped onboarding new Truecaller users on the UPI Platform and secondly, that they started an investigation on the incident.

### Keeping us in the loop

Not to talk their ears off (and yours), we basically asked them to provide information on insights and the outcomes of their investigation. Its important that the public be made aware of the reason for this security breach especially as it pertains to their own data. This also brings a level of accountability to platforms like TrueCaller to ensure that put the rights and protection of individuals first.

Additionally, we reiterated two of our previous interim steps that indicated the need for a complaint redressal mechanism and the importance of architecture documentation in the public space to enable concerned individuals identify vulnerabilities.

5981,"Hello r/India ns, Please don't sacrifice your life for your workI witnessed someone's life getting destroyed because of work pressure and urge all of you to not do that. 

I had a colleague who was  bit obsessed with his work. He would stay late hours in office to work. This all was fine until he was single. He got married last year. Even for wedding he took leave of only five days. Even after marriage his staying late at office continued. His wife, being alone at home all days, thoughts started creeping into her mind that he might be having some affair in office. (She got female colleagues number somehow, called her and asked her questions such as ""Is there a really too much work at office? , who all stay late at office?"" Like that.) 
Within six months of marriage she filed for divorce. Now this guy, he went into depression and started being late to the office,he wouldn't complete his work on time cause he was always distracted. He started receiving flak for it in the office. He became more n more depressed. He had accident few months back, I don't know but maybe because he was distracted while driving.   
Today he was let go because of poor performance. 

Devoting yourself to the work is good. But, be aware there is life outside of the work. There is your family who loves you. Do not neglect them for work. Because, if it comes to it your employer will replace you within 3 months(notice period😅). 

That's all I have to say. Thank you for reading.

Tldr: witnessed persons life getting destroyed because of work pressure. Wrote this to remind you that there is life outside of office.

Edit : Thank you whoever guilded me.",1571413834.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,328,1294

My father doesn't like Modi whereas it seems my nana is a true follower of modi. The discussions included my nana saying something about gst and corruption being less than before. Modi doing great things that Congress hasn't done before. Totally forgetting about the most bizarre and sad happenings in India right now. He doesn't care of the employment decreasing, economy decreasing, lynchings being so often people don't get surprised now, etc. 

When my father said that corruption is going higher and people are corrupt modi being on top, nana declined saying that the MPs below modi are corrupt and not modi and that he is not responsible or cannot do anything about other people being corrupt. 

And the most bizarre thing, and he actually said that word to word

""Bss modi yeh Pakistan ko jald se jald khatam karde taaki terrorism khatam ho jaye"" (Modi should end Pakistan as soon as possible to end terrorism) 

And i was shocked. And there was no way to change his mind because my father tried to do so and failed. My father just gave up and tried to end the discussion.

Why am I worried about this?  
The sort of inequality we see in India these days is quite extreme. While a tiny fraction of the population (<1%) can get by, 99% struggle. 

On a recent trip to an Indian city, I felt guilty when I heard that the family of a person we knew had fallen on really hard times- both became unemployed and their son got injured in a workplace accident. The lady worked as an elderly patient caregiver. The husband was a security guard. I am struggling too much to be able to help them, but I could not help feel stricken about the plight of the millions of families facing the same fate nationwide. The unofficial minimum wages haven't changed for ages, and even now it is just around Rs. 300 a day even for many professionals. Unlike the past, good education is not a ladder to a middle-class life anymore. 

How would this impact our society? 

For one, I think that cross-class interactions would be limited in childhood because many parents would select ""AC"" schools following the IB curriculum. Many would grow up without having a friend from a poor family. Schools would sell the ""exclusivity"" of their network as a feature (many already do). 

Also, more walls will be built to isolate the interactions (if you're rich). This building in Kolkata wanted to increase the height of the boundary wall to keep the slum dwellers.

I'm motivated to write this post because I've been cheated on in the past in a similar fashion. It was brutal but I eventually got over it but running into similar patterns in the show just brings back all those emotions. The show does a good job of gradually building to the affair but man! I shouldn't have watched it.

I'd really like to know your thoughts and feelings on the matter cause it may give me some closure. My take on it (based on what happened IRL with me) is that while it sucks for him, Srikant (like me) is also kinda responsible for the affair happening cause he didn't invest enough in the relationship. At the same time, Suchi is obviously at fault for not putting a stop to things before they got out of hand. She clearly had chemistry with the other dude. Things were treading the thin line, almost always about to cross it. Like with my ex, I expected her to uphold the trust and stop but that didn't happen.

**About what happened with me (it's long and it's mushy, so I suggest skipping over unless you really want to)**

Several years ago, before my career started, I was in this dead-end job living paycheck to paycheck. It was my first one right after college, it was mundane, the pay was bad, the work hours were terrible and they basically treated us like servants. I did my engineering in electronics and this was the only core electronics job that I could land at the time.

I prepared for interviews in the little free time there was and I was also in a relationship with someone in my hometown (this was my very first). We'd talk on the phone at night everyday, sometimes followed by a some texting on Whatsapp (I think it only supported text back then). Things seemed normal aside from the few ups and downs. However, one day I found her online much later at night. This was a few hours after we finished talking. I'm never up at those hours, I had opened up the app to see if she was up cause I couldn't sleep or something that night (can't remember the specifics) we texted anyhow, but it was strangely brief, It felt weird overall. The same thing repeated a few random days. After a few nights of this repeating, I opened the app just to see how long she stayed online and it was several hours long. The whole thing felt REALLY off but I ignored what I felt cause I really wanted to trust her. So, we talked about it and she dismissed it as catching up with old friends. It still felt off and she just dodged around my questions on why these friends only hung around at night time. I respected her privacy, feeling jealous or closely monitoring her felt beneath me. Once again, I just ignored the whole thing and continued like nothing happened.

As much as I tried to suppress it, my gut feelings just kept disturbing me all the while and one day I requested her to stop texting people at night, daytime talk was okay. Asking her that felt like I stooped to a new low, it made me feel dirty about myself.... However, she continued. At this point some part of me knew that it's over but I really wanted things to go on like nothing happened. So, once again I ignored 'myself' only to eventually discover that she was cheating on me with her ex who lived nearby. It's hard to describe what I felt but suffice to say it was an awful cocktail of negative emotions with several bouts of depression. The breach of trust was brutal. I felt broken and inadequate,   like I'm unlovable or that I did the wrong things. It took a while to trust people again, I feared relationships.

People thought I was dumb cause I wasn't aware of things. Besides, I recharged her data balance only for her to use that to talk with the other guy. As a guy, discussing emotions IRL is hard, cause everyone expects you to 'man up' and all that.

My flavour of love is kinda subdued, I'd like someone a lot but likely wouldn't express it with big words or by being around them all the time. I prefer giving space, ya know, do a bunch of other activities AWAY from them and THEN spend some time together. This may also have contributed to things going awry, she preferred intense emotions and a lot of closeness.",1571324029.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,19,25

Today we were having another 1-to-1 meeting where we talking about general work stuff and he mentioned it again. But upon asking more he said, ""he will think through it"" and I will get it ""in due time"". 

We are a small team of 6 people. Recently the business took a hit due to some policy changes and we were asked to work 10x harder and ""stay committed"". The project that is usually delivered is 2-3 months, we were able to deliver it in record 12 days. The project that I was assigned was deemed important before starting out but upon completion it was labelled as ""less important"". The other two projects are at 70% and 40% completion at the end of 20 days and are apparently more important than my project. 

Now we usually get a Flipkart or other voucher as Diwali ""bonus"" but looking at the situation, I'm not very keen on accepting it. 

It is very clear that he is stalling my requests and I'm being shafted big time. I have turned down 5 offers to stay in the current job because I was ""committed"" but looks like it isn't worth it. The last offer was 2 months ago and paid 2x more.

6166,"What does India’s national motto (Satyameva Jayathe) mean to you?""*Satyameva Jayate*"" (Sanskrit: सत्यमेव जयते satyam-eva jayate; lit. ""Truth alone triumphs."") is a mantra from the Mundaka Upanishad.

The full version of the mantra is: “*Truth alone wins, not untruth. By truth is laid out the divine path, which the seers who are free from desires, reach to the supreme abode of truth.”*

It is inscribed in script at the base of the national emblem. The emblem and the words ""*Satyameva Jayate*"" are inscribed on one side of all Indian currency. The emblem is an adaptation of the Lion Capital of Ashoka as well as all currency notes and national documents.

While in the West and some other parts of the world sex is taken casually or lightly.

But if we actually try to look deeper India has a casual attitude towards sex while the West takes it more seriously and considers that its important. Casual as in unconcerned. Sex in India isn't considered something that is important. Sex life isn't something that is considered important. Sex education isn't considered important. 

Sex is not even something that is discussed openly. People marry people they don't know enough about. Do they know or care about their sexual compatibility? Probably not much. Why? Probably coz it isn't something that matters.

So I don't think it is wrong to say that sex is a casual thing in India. It isn't sacred or anything. It just doesn't matter and it isn't something that people think is more than a way to make babies.",1571324025.0,,Politics,dark,25,57

According to very legitimate reports coming in, two acclaimed researchers - Balwan Dahiya and Kagisho Archer - have found that there is an ancient Hanuman temple - Manka Mandir (sic) - buried under Sector-16 Noida FilmCity. 

The famous story goes like this:
>Professor Balwan Dahiya Ji is a researcher of Hindu Spirituality at Rohtak University. He has done a deep study on Hanumanji. His research is that when Hanumanji was returning with Sanjeevani, a bead on his mace fell down. Thousands of years passed. In the 9th century, the bead was found by a poor Kriparam.

>Kriparam's fortunes changed as soon as he started growing rice and he became a millionaire. Then the glory of that mysterious bead was understood. His wife Bhamadevi advised to install Manka in a temple. Kriparam built a grand Bajrangi temple and installed the bead.

>The city settled around the temple. The city was so happy that it had floors of gold bricks. The name of the city was Navodaya. Then in the 11th century there was a fierce battle between King Ajeyanath and Tipu Khan of the city of Navodaya. Before Tipu can torment the city, Kuldevi ""Mahamaya"" hid the city underworld.

>Professor Dahiya's research and famous archaeologist Kagisho Archer's report says that the city of Noida is inhabited today at the place where there was a Navodaya city of gold. The objective location of the grand Bajrangi temple studded with bead is described as Sector 16A Film City. Perhaps the temple is about 3000 meters below the ground floor.

>Notably, Professor Dahiya's grandfather Bhaleram Dahiya also once met Nehru and demanded an excavation for the discovery of the Bajrangi temple. But he was ignored. Today, a number of news studios are present in Film City and imprisoned under the ground is a miraculous mystery that can change the fortunes of India.

>Professor Dahiya is now expecting the Prime Minister to correct another history by exploring the Bajrangi temple of Navodaya city as he is correcting other mistakes of Nehru. News studios can be settled anywhere, but Bajrang Bali's residence is a special place.

Lot of celebrities are showing vociferous support of the Mandir to be dug in and dug out. This story is trending across social media with #NoidaFilmCityExcavation.

I normally don't watch Regional Movies from India, other than Tamil. I hate dubbed movies and didn't have interest in listening to a language that I don't understand, but damn I've missed a lot.

The Malayalam movie Industry is seriously underrated. Saw these movies in the last two weeks taking recommendations from an Instagram post @talkingtheatre.


*Kamatipaadam
*Bangalore Days
*Premam
*Charlie
*Njan Prakashan
*Kumbalangi Nights
*Angamaley Diaries
*Ambili
*Uyare
*Ustad Hotel
*Sudani From Nigeria

Each of these movies have  unique story lines and character developments. But the similarity lies in how well crafted these ones are. Raw visuals, No Hero Worship, No Cliche'd scenes or duet songs. Every frame brought in the real colors and life to the viewer. 

More than the above, the movies have a positive effect. Some of the movies are best medicines for depression. feel good stuff with positive life lessons explained in simple backgrounds.

Sometimes I wish, why Tamil movies aren't like this.. the Last movie I could closely relate is Mayakam Enna, even though it had some dark sides. Rather than creating movies for celebrated Artists in the most common commercial and adapted story lines, I wish our directors come up with positive subjects, focusing more on the story and attributing with natural elements of life, rather than glamour and dark subjects.

Though movies on Casteism, communal violence and society are important, it's movies like these that gives a sense of satisfaction and happiness to the audience, taking a positive effect on their livelihood and ends with a happy smile or tear of joy.",1571366528.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,211,392

6378,"Income tax question? How is this legal?As you would all be aware that there would be many teachers, retired teachers and in some cases older students or home makers who would supplement income through tuition. 

I just realized that many of them don't file IT for it.

In one such case, there was a home maker who used to give math tuition for 7-10 grade. There were 2 batches for each (weekend and weekdays): 1-1.5 hours (3 days or 2 days). Each batch had 4-6 students. The costs were from 500 to 1200 a month per student. 

Thus if there were 5 students, 2 batches each, 4 grades (7,8,9,10) with a conservative average of 700 rupees a month:

This works out to 5\*2\*4\*700 = 28,000 a month.

The overhead was nothing: old books, home as the center, white board and some regular ink supply.

If my understanding is correct, they would plug this in with the monthly financial requirements (groceries, transport, bills) the husbands salary is entirely saved and can be put for investment (in case of teachers, their school salary)

I've seen this being the case for so many years and so many times, it seems to be working like a well oiled machine with no one catching up or consequences!

6390,"Performance review for Bombay PlanHi everyone
I recently came across this book which was published in 1994:
A brief memorandum outlining a plan of economic development for India

It was also popularly known as the Bombay Plan.
The Wikipedia introduction reads:
The Bombay Plan is the name commonly given to a World War II-era set of proposals for the development of the post-independence economy of India. The plan, published in 1944/1945 by eight leading Indian industrialists, proposed state intervention in the economic development of the nation after independence from the United Kingdom (which took place in 1947).

You can read more at the source:
[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombay_Plan)

It was a good read to understand the priorities of planning at that time and in many ways I feel the growth of Indian planning has been in accordance with what was described. While it wasn't officially adopted it seems to have heavily influenced the subsequent 5 year plans.

Here's an article describing it's history:
[https://qz.com/india/1464869/the-story-of-jrd-tata-gd-birlas-bombay-plan-for-india/](https://qz.com/india/1464869/the-story-of-jrd-tata-gd-birlas-bombay-plan-for-india/)

I was curious to find statistics about the economy and compare it now about 75 years after it was published. I'm not from the economics or finance world as such, although I could probably read a company's balance sheet. Does anyone know about sources where I might he able to gather these? 

It would be interesting to see it's growth and see how much of the assumptions held true and theories worked.",1571290464.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,2,10
6391,"Here's looking at you/he/she/they! The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy looks at gender and personality. 

https://preview.redd.it/0umw8d64k1t31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c9cb235eb2077bb2374bf2daebafad9cd5d412bd

**Highlights**

* *Background:*  The UN Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy is exploring the importance of the right to privacy specifically its enjoyment based on gender and personality (read to include sexual orientation, gender identity/expression). It has put out a call for feedback on a report created on this issue and a consultation it intend to have at the end of October.
* *IFF gets on board*: To contribute to the report and the consultation, IFF submits a few of its concerns and recommendations on privacy and gender and personality based on the work it does.  

### Background

The report the Taskforce created analyses submissions and research on the varying impact of privacy on women, men, individuals with different orientations, genders etc. This report was circulated to receive feedback from various stakeholders across the public and private sectors of Member States, human rights institutions, NGOs, individuals, civil society and researchers in order to conduct an international public consultation.

The consultation looks to check if gender based issues that arise in the digital era have a distinct impact on the existing right to privacy as we as individuals understand it. India is growing in its exposure and awareness to gender/personality matters and we hope that there has been sufficient representation of these issues such as the newly introduced Transgender bill etc., in this consultation by various organisations deeply involved and with greater expertise.  IFF is privileged to have had the opportunity to share our comments and recommendations on the reportin addressing increasingly significant concerns based on our learnings in our line of work.

### Our Concerns

We cover aspects of the report that complement IFF’s core areas of work in this field of digital rights and would prove useful in understanding the Indian landscape with regard to privacy. Here are brief pointers of a few concerns we highlighted.

* *Imbalance in accountability:* The need for smaller platforms to be more 'woke' in their approach toward addressing content that is abusive/discriminatory based on gender, caste, orientations considering the sectional diversity of India.
* *In the guise of women's safety:* Although done with the claim to increase the security of women, we highlight how large scale deployment of CCTVs combined with Automated Facial Recognition Systems is dangerous with no data protection law in place; especially pointing out the amplification of existing bias that such surveillance systems bring about.
* *Unknown and unchecked software:* In light of the Chinmayanand scandal ([**Read about it here**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/chinmayanand-case-body-cam-sleaze-counter-sting-but-slow-police-action/articleshow/71321780.cms)), the use of an application to secretly film an individual has seen the light of day. We express concern about the use of such unknown applications used to target unsuspecting individuals that do not conform to India conservative societal norms.
* *Community data:* As the current atmosphere begs the need to demonstrate worries with this concept, we inform that the understanding of community data includes data that is anonymised or e-commerce data. This indicates that this type of data is irrelevant data, which is an incredibly incorrect assumption. If anonymised data can be re-identified and put to use, our submission emphasizes that publicly available data can most definitely be damaging; and with sufficient access and manipulation can once again attack minorities of both class and otherwise with the current raging biases in India.

### Our two-cents

Although we provide recommendations for each of our concerns, our broader suggestions largely focused on engaging with local groups to gain perspective on the impact of privacy on individuals from different walks of life. This conversation is extremely necessary to inform work being done by the UN Special Rapporteur as most groups lack capacity to contribute to such formal processes.

Thus, it definitely is the costlier option when compared to getting a purifier yourself. So my question is to those who use an RO, how would you compare the water quality when it comes to bottled mineral water? And factoring in maintenance etc., is it a better option than buying Aquafina/Bisleri every week?

FoxStar India released the trailer for Jojo Rabbit , so I thought that it may get released, but as of now, my search has been futile

The next releases are also going to be great like Knives Out, 1917 , Queen and Slim etc

Please advise on the following:

1. Is living-in is legal in India? (I'm aware that adultery had been de-criminalized last year) Can my legal wife file a case against me?
2. If I live-in with my partner, will it affect my career? I have signed 'no plural marriage' document while joining this job. Of course, I am not going to marry my new partner unless I get a divorce from the former. But would law (and central govt. administration tribunal) consider live-in as equivalent to getting married?
3. In case I never get a divorce and live-in continues till my death, will my live-in partner inherit my assets in case I write a will on her name? I.e., who would be the legal heir in case of live-in with a will? I heard that will overrules the legal heir (which is usually spouse/relatives).

By typical IT setup, I mean you're given a set of tasks to do and those tasks are done in the time they have to be done. Nobody is rushing to finish tasks early or is interested in doing anything experimental. Everything is requirement-based and if it isn't immediately needed, it is deferred.

This isn't a bad thing because we do have work and we aren't lazing around. It's understandable that nobody would want to carry work back home or put any extra efforts than what they're paid for and I don't expect anybody to do that.

But recently, we had an employee join us from one of the bigger service based companies. He quit the job there in 3 months because he didn't like the job and wanted to relocate. This guy is very, very quick in his work. 

Ideally, we had to give him an induction about what our product is and how everything falls into place. But because everyone was busy, I gave him some tasks that would help us in generating health reports. I planned the task to take 22 days. The guy had a rough prototype ready in 3 and had a testable product in 7 days. I was impressed, but I didn't immediately have a task for him as I had planned a formal induction next month.

This guy came up with tasks. He did some test case automations and exposed a part of an automation library to allow anybody to automate test cases, did some analysis on the database models we have, some analysis on the efficiency of the application and he even wrote scripts to automate anything that took more than 5 steps.

He works a lot. I see him in the office by 9 and he leaves by 7. Then, I see him online at 11PM and he's always doing something or the other. If nothing is there, he applies for certification and starts doing that. 

While this is undoubtedly a boon to me, I don't know how the team will respond to this. The guy is paid really less because he was desperate to quit his old job. Obviously, I'd eventually recommend him for a raise to get similar salaries as other team members.

Promotion isn't an option as he has less than 1 year experience and speed isn't all we need. He documents all his work, so it's not like only he knows what he's doing.

Stepping into my shoes, do you think you'd tell this guy to slow down? I ask because I don't want him to be hated in the team. I don't think my team will respond like that but eventually when he will get the rewards, they might.

Stepping into the shoes of my team, would you be affected by such a person at work? If yes, how and what would you do about it?

I know this isn't really a problem and I might be overthinking. But I'm honestly very impressed by the way this person works. His work might not be the best code and he might not have all the skills / in-depth knowledge, but he gets stuff done.",1571280644.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,75,87

6480,"TIL India has the highest number of selfie related deaths globally, accounting for 159 of the 259 reported deaths.From the research paper - 'Selfies: A boon or bane?' published in 2018:

> From October 2011 to November 2017, there have been 259 deaths while clicking selfies in 137 incidents

> Highest number of incidents and selfie-deaths has been reported in India accounting for approximately 50% of total reported followed by Russia, the United States, and Pakistan.

> Except India, the ratio of casualties to incidents is approximately 1, whereas it is double in India.

> India has the highest number of selfie-related deaths. One reason that partially accounts for such high share is the world's largest young (age ≤30 years) population residing in India, the age group that has the highest number of deaths due to selfies.

> Also, our study has shown that the ratio of deaths to incidents is almost double in India, whereas in other countries incidents approximate the number of deaths. This unique feature could be attributed to the reason that trend of group selfies is more prevalent in India as compared to other countries.

I have this unique opportunity where I am able to do a full professional install of my entire home LAN. I've pretty much decided to pre-wire the house with fiber alongside the usual CAT6 and organise everything enterprise-style with rackmount equipment - NAS, UPS, LAN switches, NVR for security cameras etc.

The one sore point that I have to contend with is regardless of whether I get copper or FTTH from my ISP, either I will get a cheap plastic GPON ONU/ONT or a shit-tier router with the ONT built in.

I want to avoid this. I am seriously considering looking at some GPON SFP modules with built in ONT capabilities like the ones made by Huawei and plugging them into a router with an SFP port, like some Ubiquiti edgerouters.

The problem is that the module obviously needs to be configured to support the ISP's configuration, and that may involve whitelisting of the device by the ISP. Will I actually be able to do that or will I be stuck with the crappy equipment that they offer? Can I get a decent rackmount-friendly piece of hardware from them? Will they provide an SFP module that can plug into my own devices?",1571252695.0,#014980,Science/Technology,light,0,13

6686,"How do I manage planning pattern for exam due to unexpected rescheduling?I am studying law (and in final year) in a certain private university in India. Our 9th Semester (out of 10 Semesters) exams were scheduled to start from today. However, a ""pen down"" was organized by the students because some student was denied from appearing in the examination because he had not fulfilled the required attendance criteria.

Students' contention was that he could not fulfill the attendance criteria because of his mother's death.

Subsequently, the examination cell allowed him. But then he retaliated by saying I did not have time to study because he had to fight to be allowed till the last moment of starting examinations. Thus, the exam will now be rescheduled.

But I don't think the students (us) were right in doing so because:

1. If he was asking to be allowed, why did he not study?

2. Why was the exam rescheduled for everyone? It could have been rescheduled for him only. Most ""politically influenced"" students who had not studied just wanted the exam to be postponed.

3. It cost me (and possibly many other students) who make their studying pattern on the basis of the exam schedule. I had planned to study certain subjects in a gap between two subjects which I won't be able to do because today's exam will be scheduled for that day.

The new version absolutely refuses to proceed without being allowed to peek into your underwear and see the color of hair there. (*that is what I think*)

Following this new trend of intrusive banking applications (*the first one I noted was Union Bank of India*) needing all permissions available to be on before they even think about starting up, Canara Bank also has implemented this. Customer care just threw up boiler plate restart the phone, uninstall-reinstall, and interestingly asked me to take screenshot (*according to a reviewer on Google Play the app itself does not allow screenshots*) and email to an ID.

Luckily when I just wanted to try that and was in Apps section going to clear data first, I thought of checking permissions because of recent experience with Union Bank of India (*at least in that case it started up and then asked for permissions before throwing an epileptic fit*).

So there you are. **Try enabling all permissions in Settings > Apps > Permissions and check before going nuclear.**

I'm in the process of buying a house in Vijayawada for around 68 lacs. I have a couple of questions on TDS on the total cost and it would be helpful if anyone can answer them.

Here is a link explaining what TDS on property is https://cleartax.in/s/how-to-file-tds-on-sale-property


1) The buyer says he is not aware of the TDS on property selling and says he never paid TDS on any properties he sold so far although the law was in place from 2013. How is that even possible?

2) The sale agreement is actually 2 agreements. The actual sale of the house is around 30 lacs and the rest 38 lacs is for the interior and fittings and furniture. So, since the law talks about the 50 lacs cap where the 1% tax kicks in, is that applicable only for the house and so i don't need to pay TDS?

3) I have paid some down payment already and have applied for a home loan to pay the rest. The loan is sanctioned but I haven't yet asked the bank to release the money, since i got to know about this TDS. As per the act,  I'm supposed to cut TDS for whatever amount i pay. Since i didn't do that for my down payment, what are my options here?

6697,"Moving to Canada a good option?I wanted to do MS in USA, but people are saying don't go for USA if your trying to settle. I never wanted to settle anywhere except India but looking in to the future staying in canada seems to be a good option.

So, I see many people from India goes for PGDM instead of a MS ( I guess the sole reason would be PR with less money in studies compared to MS ).

I googled and found out that

1. one year of PGDM gives one year work permit.
2. 2 individual PG Diplomas also gives  3years work as MS ( Can you guys confirm this?)
3. 2 years of MS gives, 3  years work experience.

So, my doubt regarding 3.) in here is that can i complete MS in canada in 16 months back to back with 4 semesters and get 3 years work permit ( is this always true  for everyone who has 2 years study? ) or depends on individual?

for 2.) so students completing one year diploma choose the same college for doing the 2nd diploma? The student has to choose some irrelevant diploma right if they choose same college?

As of jobs I have heard its scarce and how hard is to land a job in IT if I look for a PR?

6720,"Need your opinions: Was this 30-odd year man at Nizamuddin Railway Station being reasonable? Or we expected too much?We have an infant, 7 months old, and along with my wife, we were supposed to catch a long distance train from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station few days back.

There is a Comesum restaurant right infront of the station, and we had around 6-7 big suitcases. Suddenly, the kid starts to cry, because he was hungry. We decided to boil water at Comesum with electric kettle we have, make some instant diet, feed him, and then catch the train. 

We had some 30 odd minutes, and time was crucial.

Inside the hall, we found just one charging slot, and the waiter informed that there 3-4 more on the 1st floor.

Now, a 30-odd year grown up man was charging his mobile on that slot downstairs, and playing some game. PUBG most probably. 

We requested him to shift on the first floor, and then charge his phone and play game. We described our position as quickly as possible.

I was not angry, but amused, when he told that this game would end if he unplugs his mobile, and he wont leave that slot.

When we pushed once more, he ditched the humility with which he refused the first time, and directly told us to leave him alone. Yes, he did had a look at the crying baby.

Taking 6-7 big bags on the first floor, and then prepare that diet for the kid was impossible. Out platform was like 100 kms away.

We had to console the crying kid, somehow boarded the train, and then arranged hot water from pantry car.

Now, the question: Was that man reasonable? Or we expected too much?

6738,"TIL: Record for highest attendance during a sporting event in India was during 1997 Federation Cup Semi Final between East Bengal & Mohan Bagan that witnessed an audience of 131,781 at Salt Lake Stadium, Kolkata.Most of you probably know that they are bitter rivals. East Bengal won the game 4-1 with Bhaichung Bhutia scoring a hat-trick. 

I came across this while reading about yesterday's match between India and Bangladesh where the attendance was 61,486. Probably one of the highest in recent times.

> It is to be wondered what would have happened if the AIFF, in a weak moment, reacted to Amal Dutta's suggestion that a foreign referee must be given charge of the match. And if the foreign referee, as Dutta wished, was a strict, unyielding man, the semi-final may not have taken place. For clearly, there were more people in the Salt Lake Stadium than the maximum meant to be accommodated when it was newer and in better condition. Instead of the maximum capacity of 1,20,000, there were 1,31,781. And the precise number mentioned by press reports lends belief that the figures had been given officially.

> Which means that knowingly, the AIFF and the IFA had allowed nearly 12,000 people more for the highly tense semi-final, an unpardonable excess. **The attendance set two records. One for the highest turn-out for any match, not only in India but also anywhere in Asia, and maybe anywhere in the world save for the matches at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.**

6748,"[HELP] My friend's home owners entered her house without permission multiple timesMy  friend has rented out an apartment in Mumbai. Her owners have entered  the apartment on multiple occasions. When she returns home, she often  finds random dudes doing maintenance and installation work, or at times, even worse: her stuff is thrown out of her cupboard and the owners own belongings put inside.

Just today morning, she was at the clinic because she was terribly sick. When she returned home, her belongings and some furniture (like the bed) were all over the place because the owner decided to carry out some gas pipeline work. They didn't ask for permission before entering the house. When she confronted them, they threatened her saying they won't pay the deposit amount back.

Things had been really weird lately. The owner (who lives in the same building) had previously:

* Asked the watchman to deny any food delivery or any parcels. The reason was some dumb shit like ""whatever you want to do, do outside the apartment"".
* Bad mouthed her friends and family (cousins), when they came to her apartment. Most of them just needed a place to stay for the night because of an exam, interview or layover for the next flight in Mumbai. Of course, they were denied permission to stay.
* The owner's wife often took out her frustration on my friend. When my friend was out taking lectures, she used to get random ""urgent"" calls from this woman about she randomly entered her apartment and found it to be ""dirty"" (even if it wasn't).

Finally, she decided to move out last month and found a new apartment. She will be moving out this weekend. She's just worried if they will pay her deposit back to her. Is there a legal action she can take? I'm just pissed off about how this guy could just barge into a lone woman's apartment and do whatever he wanted with her belongings without permission.",1571251203.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,18,85

**Highlights**

* *Background:* Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of Kashmir Times had filed a petition before the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the communication shutdown in Kashmir. Two journalistic bodies- Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union- had intervened in the case to support press freedom in Kashmir.
* *Secret Orders:* At today's hearing, the Government cited national security concerns in response to the Petitioner's and the Intervenors' demand for disclosure of orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules. However, the Court has directed the Government to either produce the orders or file an affidavit stating why these orders must be kept secret.

### Government files vague and conjecture filled response

At the previous hearing on 1 October 2019, the State Government had filed its response in court, and the Central Government filed a brief response endorsing the stance taken by the State Government on the same day.

On the legal basis of the communication shutdown, the State Government's response merely stated that ""*in view of the apprehension of misuse of data services, which is likely to cause deterioration in law and order situation requests were made, to service providers, from time to time, keeping in mind different zones/areas as per the threat perception prevailing at that particular time, by Inspector General of Police, Kashmir Zone, Srinagar, which were confirmed by Principal Secretary to Government of Jammu and Kashmir, Home Department in terms of Rule 2(1), first proviso, of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017.""*

As evident, the response filed was extremely vague and relied on conjectures instead of providing concrete facts and figures which would enable the court to evaluate the ""reasonableness"" and ""proportionality"" of the communication shutdown under the Constitution.

### Petitioner and Intervenors seek production of actual orders

To prevent further delay in effective adjudication of the case, the Petitioner and the Intervenors sought production of actual orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules. These orders are crucial because Rule 2 of the Telecom Suspension Rules requires that any order issued by the competent authority must contain reasons. In addition to the orders, the Intervenors also sought information about whether these orders have been reviewed and approved by a State Level Review Committee in accordance with the Rules.

During today's hearing, the Solicitor General strongly objected to the orders being disclosed to the Petitioner and the Intervenors citing ""national security"" concerns. In response, Mr. Dushyant Dave, who is the Senior Advocate appearing for the Foundation for Media Professionals, said that unless the government produces the orders, the Petitioner and the Intervenors are being forced to argue this case with their hands tied behind their back. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, who is the Senior Advocate appearing for the Indian Journalists Union, emphasized that the Government cannot make an omnibus statement and it must demonstrate how disclosure of each order can threaten national security.

After hearing both sides, the bench granted the Government time till the next hearing to file a sur-rejoinder. The government will have to either produce the orders at the next date of hearing or file an affidavit explaining why these orders cannot be disclosed. The next date of hearing in the case is 24 October 2019.

### Secret orders undermine Rule of Law

Transparency in governance is the bedrock of Rule of Law. The Indian Supreme Court recognized this as early as 1951 when Vivian Bose J. noted *""The thought that a decision reached in the secret recesses of a chamber to which the public have no access and to which even their accredited representatives have no access and of which they can normally know nothing, can nevertheless affect their lives, liberty and property by the mere passing of a Resolution without anything more is abhorrent to civilised man.""*

At the next hearing, we sincerely hope the present Supreme Court will continue this tradition of requiring the government to adopt a culture of justification rather than a culture of authority where citizens are not allowed to demand concrete reasons for violation of their rights. As always, we will keep you updated about how the case progresses.

Not just parents, many people say this line to others.

I believe it is simply superstitious and a very bad advice. If our actions had such reactions, it would have been visible. But the truth is that the person who do bad things often end up happiest. Think about it, the entire human psychology is focused on loving the bad and abandoning the good.

And this is very simple. Being bad gives you an amazing variety of options in life. Want to earn money? Get into unethical practices and earn tons of money. 

Want to get a hot woman? Psychologically manipulate her by intentional ghosting and trying to show you don't care and all the amazing psychology tactics.

Want to get promoted in your company? Get the highest achiever into trouble by framing him.

Want to be at top? Learn to use honest people.

What I want to say is that life becomes easier as we open our horizons and till date I haven't seen karma being true. It's all just done to make sure that honest and good people remain that so they can be exploited. A very very good and successful way if that is intention .

PS- I am not saying to commit crime and get caught. This is because laws don't permit some things. You have to be crafty in that lol.
