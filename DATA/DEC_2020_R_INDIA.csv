1,"How can a NRI participate in in anti CAA/NRC/.. movement ?I am an NRI staying in US for last few years and very disturbed by the direction country is taking and happy that there is movement against that direction. I keep myself updated about what's going in my country and have participated in protest against CAA/NRC in my local city. But after that one time event , I do not see any more avenue on where to participate and contribute to that movement.  I am sure there are more NRI in this sub-reddit who are in similar boat.  Any guidance will be appreciated. 

FYI, I am very private person on the internet. I do have facebook and twitter account but do not post or comment at all. Once in a while I login to see how are my friends and family members are doing in life, and  I do see hate filled  posts  by many of old colleagues and friends . I have not engaged with any of them as it's very clear that they are not going to change their mind irrespective of logic or fallacy of their arguments.  I just unfriended my old friend in facebook because I can't see his hate filled posts after calling himself secular, and they have already proclaimed that whoever disagrees with him/her point of view is uneducated, traitor and shall go to Pakistan.  Given that I have been silent on facebook for years,  any advice on shall I become active and any advice on that too. 

I have pulled myself out of whatsapp because most folks are for CAA and NRC or in other words they are full supporter of Modi-Shah. But they try not to discuss politics, but there are folks who keep on forwarding hate filled messages , twisting every facts and figure with self selection biases.  I have had reacted strongly to one forward which said that anyone who does not support and forward a message is traitor. They person apologized by saying do not take forward seriously. I had quit that group after that. 

However, when I do go to parties, I clearly engage in conversations where I and may be other are on one side of conversation and everyone is on other side.  It does create awkward situation in relationships and wife constantly tells me why you have to care and engage so deeply in conversations. Same is situation in my extended family where some folks hates Muslim and it would come out after few minutes of conversation, and others are under the influence of modi propaganda but with with argumentation, facts and logic they can see that their beliefs are potentially wrong. 

&#x200B;

Only good news in all the situations is that all the kids of the NRIs who goes to American schools  know that their islamophobic parents are on wrong side of history. During debate, they would support me by questioning their parents and their logic is so sound and they are so patient and unemotional that parents are speechless. But the kids know their boundaries and they move on with their life. So I am so optimistic that next generate of Indian origin kids will be more rationale , inclusive and will make this world a better place. So hope is very much alive. 

Sorry for long write up, I got carried away. But any advice on how I can support the movement better will be helpful.",1577736243.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,3,21

As we enter the decade, the economy is destroyed and will fare worse in the next year. The social fabric is in tatters and a few hundred innocents have been brutalised and a troll army is celebrating it. I see many of my former friends supporting this crap even as the industries they work in get decimated by competition from china.   


This is the gloomiest new year I've ever seen in India. There's literally not one thing to be happy about. Yes, personal life is more important, but when there are so many uncertainties in professional life it is difficult to be hopeful.

17,"Neoliberal system crumbling right before our eyes.In last few decades, global politics had consistently take more neoliberal and corporatist turn. Things have been allowed to get so bad only because the general public, who is supposed to act as the watchdog against the politicians who wield too much power in society had been distracted by the so called 'fruits of capitalism'.

But in 2019, we have seen all the lies and deception of the current system on capitalism exposed. Whether it is in form of unprecedented levels of ecological destruction, in Brazil, Australia etc. or in form unexpected and unrelated protest movements around the globe.

Response to these massive changes by those who we deem in charge, those who are supposedly in places of power to represent us, has been at best less then underwhelming and at worst deliberately detrimental to the vast majority of the global population.

We are witnessing fatal wounds being delivered to the 'gradual change' and 'status quo' politics everywhere. And death of such a flowed system of governance is long overdue. 

In the coming decade, centrist politics would rightfully be extinct and we the people will be left with the choices of either giving in to the darker more reactionary elements of our society and further move into isolation on the basis of nationality, religion, region, language, culture, caste, class etc. (all the man made ideas intended to divide people in sub groups that has for generation kept a common human struggle at bay) , or of at last removing arbitrary distinctions from our minds and rebuild a fair and just society out of the ruins of the currently dying neoliberal system that only survives as long as the silent majority remains willfully and conveniently distracted.",1577724551.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,3,22

27,"The Purpose of War (1984) - George OrwellThe primary aim of modern warfare is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. From the moment when the machine first made its appearance it was clear to all thinking people that the need for human drudgery, and therefore to a great extent for human inequality, had disappeared. If the machine were used deliberately for that end, hunger, overwork, dirt, illiteracy, and disease could be eliminated within a few generations. And in fact, without being used for any such purpose, but by a sort of automatic process — by producing wealth which it was sometimes impossible not to distribute — the machine did raise the living standards of the average humand being very greatly over a period of about fifty years at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. But it was also clear that an all-round increase in wealth threatened the destruction — indeed, in some sense was the destruction — of a hierarchical society. In a world in which everyone worked short hours, had enough to eat, lived in a house with a bathroom and a refrigerator, and possessed a motor-car or even an aeroplane, the most obvious and perhaps the most important form of inequality would already have disappeared. If it once became general, wealth would confer no distinction. It was possible, no doubt, to imagine a society in which wealth, in the sense of personal possessions and luxuries, should be evenly distributed, while power remained in the hands of a small privileged caste. But in practice such a society could not long remain stable. For if leisure and security were enjoyed by all alike, the great mass of human beings who are normally stupefied by poverty would become literate and would learn to think for themselves; and when once they had done this, they would sooner or later realize that the privileged minority had no function, and they would sweep it away. In the long run, a hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance.

To return to the agricultural past, as some thinkers about the beginning of the twentieth century dreamed of doing, was not a practicable solution. It conflicted with the tendency towards mechanization which had become quasi-instinctive throughout almost the whole world, and moreover, any country which remained industrially backward was helpless in a military sense and was bound to be dominated, directly or indirectly, by its more advanced rivals. Nor was it a satisfactory solution to keep the masses in poverty by restricting the output of goods. This happened to a great extent during the final phase of capitalism, roughly between 1920 and 1940. The economy of many countries was allowed to stagnate, land went out of cultivation, capital equipment was not added to, great blocks of the population were prevented from working and kept half alive by State charity. But this, too, entailed military weakness, and since the privations it inflicted were obviously unnecessary, it made opposition inevitable. The problem was how to keep the wheels of industry turning without increasing the real wealth of the world. Goods must be produced, but they must not be distributed. And in practice the only way of achieving this was by continuous warfare. The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built.

In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population. In practice the needs of the population are always underestimated, with the result that there is a chronic shortage of half the necessities of life; but this is looked on as an advantage. It is deliberate policy to keep even the favoured groups somewhere near the brink of hardship, because a general state of scarcity increases the importance of small privileges and thus magnifies the distinction between one group and another. By the standards of the early twentieth century, even a member of the Inner Party lives an austere, laborious kind of life. Nevertheless, the few luxuries that he does enjoy his large, well-appointed flat, the better texture of his clothes, the better quality of his food and drink and tobacco, his two or three servants, his private motor-car or helicopter—set him in a different world from a member of the Outer Party, and the members of the Outer Party have a similar advantage in comparison with the submerged masses whom we call ’the proles’. The social atmosphere is that of a besieged city, where the possession of a lump of horseflesh makes the difference between wealth and poverty. And at the same time the consciousness of being at war, and therefore in danger, makes the handing-over of all power to a small caste seem the natural, unavoidable condition of survival.",1577695500.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,34

As the government cannot argue with the simple and clear discriminatory language of the CAA and NRC, they have resorted to the classic technique of discrediting the speaker - in this case the protestors, by labelling them as violent.

While the isolated incidents of violence are few in number and sensational in nature, they get documented but no one likes to take note of people just sitting or marching peacefully. That doesn't mean they're not happening. Lakhs and lakhs of people march all over India every day to oppose the communalisation of our country. 

I hence ask for your help - let's come together as a community and compile a list of all the peaceful protests happening around the nation - which all of us can use to counter the false narrative being spread by the hate-mongers. Here's how:

1. Look for your city name in the comments
2. Reply to the city name with all of the peaceful protests you know about that have taken place there - please try your best to add a news source that proves this or a date-verifiable image. Add the number of protestors if you have a source.
3. If you do not see your city name, add it as a comment and add the details under

I will compile all of these and post it back here and as a separate post that can be easily shared on other platforms

[Sadhguru's views](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11RgVkZcPjY)

---

* Right at the beginning of the speech, Sadhguru admits that he hasn't read the act in its entirety. His views are based on what he read in the newspapers, and what ""is generally out there"". 

* Sadhguru repeats Amit Shah's lie that West Pakistan had 23% non-Muslims and 30% in Bangladesh. He claims that nobody has perfect numbers but these numbers can't be totally wrong. Expect, that they are: https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/pakistan-bangladesh-non-muslim-population-citizenship-amendment-bill-bjp-1627678-2019-12-12. A detailed analysis from Anand Ranganathan, now editor at Swarajya Magazine: https://www.newslaundry.com/2015/01/09/the-vanishing-hindus-of-pakistan-a-demographic-study-2?fbclid=IwAR1kKrkFa8Zj-X5sYDAU4mTbJDd8ERCkK6n38BcTGuu3-QEBFzzQnK8gq68

* He claims that minorities were persecuted during the 1971 war. While not false, this does paints a selective narrative. The genocide leading up to the 1971 war of Bangladeshi independence saw a large section of Muslims killed as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1971_Bangladesh_genocide

* Sadhuru claims that, unlike India, other (read Pakistan and Bangladesh) have religious discrimination built into their legal framework. This is demonstrably false in the case of Bangladesh as the [constitution of Bangladesh expressly forbids the state to discriminate on the basis of religion](http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/research/bangladesh-constitution.pdf) [See Art. 28, 29 & 41]. Pakistan does have religious discrimination as only a Muslim can become the prime minister or the president, but Bangladesh does not have such limitations. 

* Sadhguru claims that Hindu marriages don't have legal recognition in Pakistan. This is no longer (since 2017) the case: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-39233567. He even claims that he asked several people and they confirmed it (which is weird since the truth is but a google search away)

* Sadhguru falsely claims that India does not have blasphemy laws: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law#India (though to be fair to him, blasphemy is not punishable by death in India and the laws are used to harass people of all religions). 

* He claims that 3 million Bangladeshi Hindus were killed in the 1971 war. That's an iconic figure in Bangladeshi culture and is often questioned: https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/questioning-an-iconic-number/article5940833.ece. Regardless, the genocide (as I mentioned earlier), not only Hindus were killed. There Pakistani Army was brutal against Bangladeshi Muslims demanding independence as well. Bihari Muslims were also persecuted by the Bengalis, their woes are often forgotten. 

* He claims that Assam has been overrun by refugees, and the refugee population in Assam is bigger than the local population. This is staggeringly false as even the Assam NRC which has been criticised as draconian could only find 19 lakh people who came to Assam after 1971 (from a population of 3.2 crore). 

* He claims that people are protesting because they don't want to give refugee to anyone. While this may be the case in Assam, the majority of the country is protesting because we believe that the CAA is discriminatory in nature as it introduces a religious filter for acquiring Indian citizenship. 

* Sadhguru then claims that CAA only gives citizenship to those facing religious persecution. This is again false, as CAA simply assumes that anyone who is Hindu, Sikh, Christian, Jain, Buddhist or Parsi has faced religious persecution. The phrase ""religious persecution"" is not even present in the act. 

* Sadhguru excuses the police violence by claiming that when a few thousand protestors corner 25 policeman and thrash them, it is only natural that these protestors will face the consequences of their actions when a bigger police force arrives. He further justifies the police action by claiming that even if not all the protestors were throwing stones, it is only natural that everyone of them will be beaten up if there were incidents of stone throwing. 

* He commends the police for showing restrain and not resorting to firepower. We know that was not the case.  [Video suggesting shots were fired](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/3-days-after-jamia-violence-delhi-police-investigate-shooting-videos-2150987) | [Protestors with bullet injuries](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/jamia-clashes-two-protesters-admitted-to-delhi-hospital-with-bullet-injuries-says-official-2149762)

* Refers to those protesting as ""illiterate masses of religious groups"". 

* He claims that people have been misinformed as the CAA does not take away people's citizenship. He completely omits the fact that people are protesting because of a genuine fear that combined with NRC, CAA will be discriminatory towards Indian Muslims. We see that this will already be the case in Assam, where out of the 19 lakh that were left out of NRC, the non-Muslims will be eligible for citizenship while the Muslims will not be. 

* He parrots a list of documents that will be enough to prove your citizenship while ignoring the fact that the document with the most widespread reach in the country - aadhar - is not a proof of citizenship. See: https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2019/dec/21/aadhaar-voter-id-card-passport-not-proof-of-citizenship-government-officials-2079070.html

The fundamental problems with the CAA (and NRC) are as follows ([courtesy: Student Bar Association, NLSIU](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EMPdXi1KXbpRei1WRcdpDpOgsBjpzsif/view))

* **What is it?** Allows for immigrants from certain communities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to acquire citizenship. 

* **Evident Problems** Muslims are excluded from acquiring citizenship solely on the basis of religion. Furthermore, definition of illegal migrants restricted to only three countries, this excluding other neighbouring countries like Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Nepal, etc.

* **Why is this problematic?** Our Constitution envisages India to be a secular state. This means that no distinction can be made between persons solely on the basis of religion. Hence, excluding Muslims expressly violates the secular nature of our Constitution.

* **Regional Restrictions** There is no rational basis for restricting the countries from which inflow is allowed to Pakistan, Bangladesh and
Afghanistan. The amendment allegedly aims to protect persecuted minorities. Then what about the Tamils from Sri Lanka, the Rohingyas from Myanmar, the Nepali Gorkhas and the Uighurs and Ahmadiyas facing persecution? The amendment does not consider this.

* **What about the NRC?** The National Register of Citizens, first implemented in Assam, required a person to produce documents of her
ancestry in order to be eligible for citizenship. This falls hard on even legitimate citizens due to lack of necessary documents. Therefore even citizens can get excluded under the NRC, like in Assam, where over 19 lakh applicants were excluded from the final list.

* **NRC & CAA - a double threat?** Now, if an Indian citizen gets excluded under the NRC, and if she is a non- Muslim, she can claim citizenship under the CAA. However, if she happens to be a Muslim, then CAA ensures that she will not be granted citizenship as a naturalised migrant.

**Sadhguru fails to address even a single criticism of the act, while painting the protestors as people with no shred of sympathy for those fleeing religious persecution.**",1577697000.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,147,870

Now the problem start suppose you mentioned that you came from Bangladesh in 1970, the problem is the land and home you own must be bought or owned after 1970, because you have no existence before 1970. But under the FEMA Act Citizens of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, China, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan, Macau or Hong Kong cannot buy Land without approval of RBI. Even though there was modification in 2018.

Even if you have bought the property after 1970, you have to show the approval of RBI.

And now you are screwed, and fight a legal battle for every land and home you own. Or lose your home and land.

I am still doing research, what would happen after getting citizenship.",1577732053.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,5,46

217,"Rehana has been sitting on dharna for the past 10 days with her ""20 DAYS OLD DAUGHTER""Rehana has been sitting on dharna for the past 10 days along with over 1,500 protesters — all of them women

Twenty-day-old Ashiana is the youngest “protester” among the intrepid women who have gathered at Shaheen Bagh, southeast Delhi.

The little girl is too young to understand the mood around her but has become the face of the fight for the future — at least for her mother.

“I  fear more for the future of my newly born daughter and her two brothers aged 8 and 10,” Rehana Khatoon said as she sat on the road in the biting cold under a shamiana, cradling her baby.

“This government has sinister designs and the citizenship law is only aimed at targeting Muslims. It’s a matter of life and death for us.”

Rehana said religion was being used as an excuse to divide the country. “We are Indians first, then Muslims, and this is our identity.  Neither Modi nor Amit Shah can take this identity away from us.”

Women,  among them elderly homemakers and students, have been sitting in protest against the amended citizenship law for the past 10 days on  NH-24 — that connects Delhi with Noida — in Shaheen Bagh, a locality in  Okhla’s Jamia Nagar, a predominantly Muslim neighborhood.

The sit-in began after the brutal police crackdown on Jamia Millia Islamia students on December 15.

Azra  Shaheen, a mother of two, said the sit-in had started with a handful of women. Sensing the growing fear among the community, women then started coming out from their homes from nearby localities, the number swelling to nearly 1,500.

Food and water are being provided by a  community kitchen run by volunteers, who have also distributed blankets to brave the cold.

“Breaking stereotypes, Muslim women stepped out of their houses to make their presence felt to fight against the government’s discriminatory policy. We were strangers when we joined the protest initially but now we have become part of a big family. We are eating, sleeping and protesting together under the open sky,” she said.

“After the day’s work they take care of the children at home,” she said.

At the sit-in the women wave Tricolours, chant slogans of “*azadi*” and also recite Urdu poems and patriotic songs, including *Saare Jahan se Achchha Hindustan hamara, Dil diya hai jaan bhi denge, Aye watan tere liye*’.

Shahnaz Begum, 60, said she was unwell and was down with a cold for the past two days but wouldn’t budge an inch till the law is withdrawn.

“*Ye Hindu aur Muslim ki ladai nahin hai, ye sahi aur galat ki ladai hai* (This is not a fight between Hindus and Muslims, it is a fight between right and wrong),” she said.

321,"How is it possible for my [29M] (Indian)parents to have such opposing schools of thought? Scientific day-job v.s. Religious outlook; Sending child abroad to pursue education v.s. Expecting him to come home when finished; Wanting child to live a happy married life v.s. no freedom in choosing partnerI \[29M\] by no means want to disrespect my parents (if that came across from the title). They've done amazingly well for themselves as well as for me and my sibling. They're both medical doctors and have come from very humble beginnings. My childhood memories include a lot of coercion towards getting better grades with the belief that life gets easier with better grades (which I've found is true as an adult). Additionally, a lot of prayers and puja rituals for a better future (not sure about this one). I left my house when I was 18 years old to go to a completely new state to pursue my undergraduate in one of the top engineering institutes in the country. Here is where things changed.

Met people from almost all states of the country. Some were 12th board toppers and some didn't do well in school but had put in whatever they had into entrance exam preps to get here, essentially most of them, extremely smart. My religious beliefs were challenged here. After 2 years of denial and not being able to defend religion in front of my peers, I started questioning my own upbringing. Realized at 20 that maybe my own beliefs were wrong. Took up questioning religion as a constant side thought. By 25, read books from multiple religions and non-religious spiritual books (e.g. Vivekananda), convinced that religion didn't make any sense. Shared my change in belief with Mum and Dad. Huge backlash. My engineering institute was labelled as blasphemy and my friends as good-for-nothing heretics. Tried for about a year for them to at-least consider my point of view. Emotional blackmail, dismissals and denials. Couldn't understand how two people who are masters of biology and human anatomy, save people's lives using that scientific knowledge can be so opposed to reconsidering religion. I'm sure that causes some sort of weird cognitive dissonance. How can one reconcile between two opposing ways of thinking? Stopped trying to convince them a year later, realizing nothing good was going to come off of it.

At 25, I had a good job, a relatively high salary in a big corporation, right out of college. Got bored of it after a couple of years and switched to medical research to get some fulfillment. Took a drastic pay cut. Wasn't too bothered as I craved some intellectual stimulation. Mum wasn't happy with the pay cut. Dad was cool. I was dating a girl outside my caste at that point, we had been friends since primary school. Mum disapproved of having a gf in general, especially because of the caste clash. Eventually the relationship didn't work out, for reasons not related to caste. The preference for a particular caste has been a huge thing in my family too. When I asked, the reason given to me was ""our caste is superior"". I've a feeling all castes think similarly. Simultaneously, there was pressure from family to pursue higher education. I already had an undergraduate in electronics and a masters in physics by that point. Applied for PhD anyway. Got into a good university abroad.

Currently in my final year of PhD in a STEM field. Major transformation in perspective happened when I came to this western country. PhD has had its ups and downs, but overall going well. Towards end of first year, met a western girl born and brought in the city I'm in. Her persona was completely opposite to mine. She was extremely active, very opinionated and headstrong. I, on the other hand, was a typical studious, happy-go-lucky, relatively passive, nice guy. I was very fascinated by her. Took her and her sister on a month-long backpacking tour of India to show its beauty. Was the first trip I made in life which was not arranged by my parents and I had my own freedom, in addition to having the responsibility of two people who had never visited the country. I assumed everything was going to go well. However, the fiery, passionate start quickly led to verbal and then physical abuse after the India trip, when I couldn't provide her what she wanted. At its worst, I knelt down on a street outside her house asking for forgiveness from her, a year after we had started dating. I shudder at that memory now. That coupled with my failing PhD because of lack of my attention to it, made me develop extreme anxiety, depression and self-hatred. Broken down, I broke it off about a year ago. I reached out to family for help, told them everything that was important (didn't tell them the gory details of physical abuse and kneeling down) and exposed how bad I was feeling. As a response, I was accused of getting romantically involved with a 'white girl', was asked to focus on my PhD and come back to India after my studies are done. When I mentioned that their reaction wasn't helping and I was feeling genuinely down and low, Mum suggested I pray and ask for forgiveness from divinity. I mentioned again that I didn't believe in the supernatural, yet she persisted. I was shocked at this reaction, but I was willing to try anything. I prayed everyday out of desperation, but kept feeling worse, now, with the additional judgment of feeling like a fraud for praying as a non-believer. A couple of weeks later, I told her I was still feeling bad and all my praying didn't help. She retorted saying prayer was not a magic spell that'll work right away, that I needed to persist. I knew there was no point arguing. I really needed their help then. The only helpful suggestion given was to avoid 'that white girl'. Sigh. Finally, stopped praying, booked an appointment with a psychiatrist. Diagnosed with anxiety. 7 months of mental health issues, self-hatred and helplessness. To make it worse, ex-gf got involved with someone else and when it didn't work out with him, came back to me. In my desperate need to connect with someone, anyone, I took her back, realized this was a toxic mistake and broke it off again in a couple of months. Was contemplating the worst at a point.

Started reconnecting with friends, going to the gym and generally just trying to live. In my attempt to reconnect with people around me, started talking to someone whom I had known for years, but never got the chance to connect with her properly. Was pleasantly surprised at her empathy and understanding when I poured everything out. We started hanging out. After a while, I started feeling better, knowing she had a lot of input in it. As I recovered, was very taken by how much she's done for me. Knew that I needed her in my life, not just as a friend. Currently celebrating 5 months of relationship at end of 2019. She's the most understanding and compatible person I've ever met. Extremely smart and attractive. We have moved in together. Introduced her to mum initially as a 'friend'. Mum asked me to keep my distance from her, as she's a 'white girl'. I stood up to mum for the first time in my life and asked her to back off. Spent the last 2 months slowly introducing her to the idea of having a white daughter-in-law. High resistance from the other side. But after everything I've gone through and the way my gf has picked me up and given my identity back to me, losing her not an option. Mum has been pestering me about arranged marriage. Can't believe that she would rather me be with a stranger than the one I know is good for me and will make me happy. I've learnt the lesson of how I judge myself when I don't stand up to myself. Not gonna repeat the same mistake again. At 29, I'm just about beginning to realize how weak and a pushover I have been.

I love my parents and really want them to be happy. I'm extremely grateful for what they done for me. But I want them to be happy for me too. I'm not sure I'm willing to compromise my own happiness, possibly for the rest of my life, to make them happy because of their archaic and illogical belief system. I cannot go through another bout of depression and anxiety again. I'm sticking to what I know makes me happy. I'm almost done with my PhD and will venture out into the world. I want to do it on my terms now.

Rant over. Any thoughts, comments, criticisms, insults and support appreciated. Also, is this a general case across Indian parents?

TL-DR; As a 20 year old, I started having conflicts with family about religion, potential partners. At 29 now, realized I've been weak and a pushover most of my life, don't want to feel like this anymore. Taking a stand now. Is this a general theme across Indian parents?

325,"Hindus are not in danger. Economy and democracy are in danger.Hindu khatre mein nahi hai. Economy aur democracy khatre mein hai.

It's is often said by sanghis who claim that 'Hindu khatre mein hain' and that india will become Muslim majority by 2050, however the reality is that even if Hindus do not have any children and if the Muslim population grows at a rate of 2% per year, the Muslim population will only be about 360 million(36 crore) and for the Muslim population to even reach the current level of hindu population it will take about 80 years growing at a constant rate of 2%.

This 2% isn't even their actual growth rate, it's even lesser.

In 1951 census, the population of India was 360.9 million(36.09 crore) out of which 303.6 million(30.36) was Hindu and Muslim was 35.4 million(3.54 crore), in 2011 census, the population of India was 1.21 billion(121 crore)  of which hindu population was about 965.6 million(96.56 crore) and Muslim population was about 171.8 million(17.18 crore).

So this means, from 1951 to 2011 census, the contribution of population growth of Hindus is about 78% and Muslims is about 16%. So no, india is not going to be Muslim majority and taken over in 2050 or something along those lines, it is just fear mongering by sanghis.

Also since india became more developed compared to 1951, the fertility rate has come down across ALL religions. More developed areas have lower fertility rates in general.

Right now, democracy and economy are in danger.

Our GDP has been the lowest at 4.5% since the past 6 years. You can't have $5 trillion economy in 2024, if the economy is slowing down like this, we need a double digit growth to accomplish, yet since every quarter, the economic growth is sliding down.

Several sectors of the economy are experiencing negative growth. This [article](https://thewire.in/economy/facing-the-reality-how-can-modi-reverse-the-current-economic-slowdown) explains the problems pretty well and also talks about solutions.

As we also know democracy is also under threat, look what's happening in UP, Delhi and many other places, dissent is being shutdown. Many protesters are getting beaten, getting shot, some of them are getting killed. Dissent is also stopped by bringing internet shutdowns. India accounts for 67% of all internet shut downs, that happen across the world, the internet shutdowns in kashmir has been longer than 145 days, longest ever in a democracy. India has the most number of internet shutdowns in the world by far. India's rank in freedom of press index is dropping.

The opposition to CAA is being called 'anti-nationals' as usual. The CAA-NPR-NRC is deadly combo, it will have their way for a Hindu rastra and therefore it would be the end of a secular democracy. it will strip millions of Muslim of their citizenship. The financial cost of this will be insane.

The NRC in Assam costed about Rs. 1,220 crores which has a population of 30.6 million(3.06 crore) which is about 2.2% of india's population. Out of that, 1.9 million(19 lakh) were could'nt prove their citizenship. The cost of this would be Rs. 399 per person.

If we apply this to whole nation, whose population is 1.37 Billion(137 crore), it would be about Rs. 55,000 crore. Building one detension centre in Assam, which could detain about 3,000 people costed about Rs. 45 crore.

Detaining even 50 million(5 crore) people, this would cost about Rs. 7.5 lakh crore. For comparison total budgetary expenditure for health and education was Rs. 8.4 lakh crore in 2018-19. This whole CAA-NPR-NRC is not only extremely discriminatory but also financially terrible.",1577719417.0,,Politics,dark,17,209

328,"CAA and those who are excluded from the soon to be implemented NRCWhat would happen to all those individuals who would be left out of the NRC? Theoretically all the non-muslims can still become citizens of they claim and prove that they are illegal migrants from the CAA related countries. But there seems to be some serious practical and procedural problems for this so called safety net offered by the CAA to non-muslims. Some of these are listed below. I hope everyone would engage with these questions and give their suggestions on how these situations will be dealt with by the state. Also feel free to post your own doubts and problems in the comments which haven't been listed here.

1. According to the Assam model, there will be multiple arbitrations and updations after the first NRC and during these procedures the involved parties in all probability would make claims that they are Indian citizens and might even give affidavits confirming these claims starting from local bureaucrats to the foreigners tribunal. Once these statements are in their files how can they claim that they are undocumented migrants from foreign countries who could avail the protection offered by the CAA, if they are absent from the final NRC?
2. How can people prove that they are from the specific countries. It should be kept in mind that most of the m couldn't produce any documents prove their Indian citizenship. How would they then establish foreign citizenship and religious affiliation convincingly?
3. What would be done if people convert or blindly claim that they belong to one of the persecuted minorities ?
4. What would happen with children of undocumented migrants (born in India) belonging to minorities from the three countries? They were never foreign citizens and never faced persecution for their religious beliefs.
5. What would be the status of atheists and children from inter-religious marriages?

Unless the government can give convincing answers to these questions and to the numerous others raised by various critics and sceptics moving forward with the implementation of CAA-NRC would be disastrous and would render very large sections of the society stateless. It might also lead to a mafia supplying fake documents and would encourage rampant corruption among the various levels of the bureaucracy. The Muslims who can't prove their citizenship convincingly will be surely screwed. Also beyond this a large number of poor Hindus and other religious minorities and dalits will also be rendered stateless by the NRC and they might not be protected by the CAA (which I believe was a main agenda for the government). I think the government is lying to almost every community in the country except the rich individuals/groups and even maybe planning to remove poverty by removing the poor.",1577724696.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,11

Lyrics:

Halak se nikli baat yahan JNUl kyun sasta hai

Sawaal banta tera private college main kyun kat ta 

Satta pe beithe leech, fees se gareeb noche

yahan ghoose deke padhne waale JNU pe bhonke

jhonke school paatal main , murti aasaman main

sangarsh ka ye harsh bethi bagawat pe beti

aawaaz aag ka taap, vidroh ka haav bhaav

kehti bahaav ke saath aksar laashe hain behti 

Tu maun bakra yaun tujhe katne ki hai aadat 


sapnon pe tere in gawaaron ki likhawat or

Nizamat ka chaiwaala padha likha hota 

to is haq ki ladaayi main saath khada hota

haan chaar gaadi waala neta free ka rashan khaata kyun

Utre hain sadak pe kyun AIIMS, IIT, IIMC or BHU

Uttrakhand ke ayurvedic college main bawaal hai

safed kurte main neta ban beitha hai dallal hai

Tera ek neta einstein ki gravity pe atka hai

Ek bola mor aansu peeke bacha karta hai

ek gaaye ka moot pilake karta cancer theek

khud hota jab bimaaar tab AIIMS main jaa ke padta hai




Chorus



Ye tukde tukde kon hai, Jo shiksha ke dallal hai

Ye tukde tukde kaun hai, bikaau patrakaar hai

Ye tukde tukde kaun balaatkaar pe maun

chowkidar ka hai bhes par godse ki kaum

Ye tukde tukde kon jo desh bantwaate hai

Ye khud ki aulaadon ko videsh main padhate hai

haq ki ladaayi main ye laathiya chalvaate hai

or anpadhon ko yahan beta bhakt ye banaate hain


kya khaak tarraki karega mera desh ye

kisaan latke hain khet pe , ladki marti hai rape se

balaatkaar karne waale mantri ghoome pradesh main

or 56 inch ke seene waala ghume videsh main

yahan haal hai behaal , patrakaar hai betaaal

Mallal ki ye baat, bemisaal tum haraam ho 

zehan ki ye baat ek pankti main bayaan karun to  

My dear friend tum kadve ho dallal ho

PHD pe kanhaiya ki logon ko swaal hai

khud ke neta paas kiya MA 33 saal main

media to mauji ki godi main soti hai

Kutton ke chaatne ki bhi seema hoti hai

haaan fek degree waale tujhko kya padhaayege

bnaayenge ye mandir or pakode talvaayenge

bhaktkaayenge muddon se sarkaar ye leechad hai 

keechad main kamal nahi launde kamal hi keechad hai



Ye tukde tukde kon hai, Jo shiksha ke dallal hai

Ye tukde tukde kaun hai, bikaau patrakaar hai

Ye tukde tukde kaun balaatkaar pe maun

chowkidar ka hai bhes par godse ki kaum

Ye tukde tukde kon jo desh bantwaate hai

Ye khud ki aulaadon ko videsh main padhate hai

Have totally cut out vegetable oil + spices for 3+ months. I feel fantastic now, given that I have reprogrammed my taste buds and eat for my gut, not for my tongue. Would definitely love to get rest of the family on a bread based diet.

I am very interested in making bread at home - given that potassium bromate was found in indian bread and the food testing standards can easily be bypassed.

Questions:
- We have this for baking cakes, not sure if we can try bread on it - https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B009P2KQXK/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1

However, I do not know which language/script to get it in, as both resonate with me for different reasons. 

My grandparents didn't speak Bengali, only Hindi, as my grandfather was born in what was then eastern Madhya Pradesh and now Chhattisgarh, and he spoke Hindi, while my grandmother, born in Kolkata, learned Hindi instead of Bengali as a child. So my original thought was to get "" Kolkata "" written in Devanagari like this: कोलकाता .

But I was thinking as to whether to get it in Bengali instead, as a way of paying homage to the land and ethnic group that raised my grandparents. My grandparents and the family that are still in Kolkata have Bengali-based culture and traditions rather than Central Indian/Hindi, the only difference is that they speak Hindi rather than Bengali. So I was wondering about a tattoo in Bengali like this: কলিকাতা .

Counter Argument - But BJP lost in Jharkhand!

Opposing View - BJP would have lost by an even bigger margin in Jharkhand had paper ballots been used.

&#x200B;

I think the CAA, NRC, NPR protest is at a stage now that it can be used to rope in related issues and expand the reach of protests to meet demands which should have been granted to us long ago.

The Expanded Five point demand by protesters should be :-

1. Roll back CAA. Population census is fine (under Census Act 1948), it does not come under the ambit of Citizenship Act of 1955. However, NPR and NRIC do come under the ambit of Citizenship Act - the government should say that they do not intend to go through with the exercise of NPR and NRIC in their current term - until 2024.
2. Jobs, water and affordable food - where are ""achche din""? This was all promised by the government.
3. Ban EVM from all forms of elections in India - only paper ballots.
4. Police involved in manhandling of CAA protesters and breaking protester's property should be indicted in fast trial courts.
5. State government should compensate families of victims abused by the police.

&#x200B;

The protesters should not stop protesting unless all these demands are met summarily - we need to tell the government this time  who really holds the power. 

&#x200B;

If we do not demand justice, we will never receive it - current India is by no means a ""Ram Rajya""!",1577649429.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,28

653,"The Delhi Police must stop it's facial recognition system### Tl;dr

As per a [report published yesterday in the Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/), the Delhi Police is using a “Automated Facial Recognition System” (AFRS) at public congregations. This is an act of mass surveillance and is completely illegal. We wrote to the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs and Commissioner of Police, Delhi demanding a complete halt and recall of the AFRS. Our legal notice sets out its illegality in detail. 

https://preview.redd.it/flvypu78si741.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cf2137a300c6aaed7a2c10d03a2a4589b4c8e32

### It starts with low success rate in locating missing children

In 2017 a petition came to be filed in the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi docketed as *Sadhan Haldar v The State NCT of Delhi* \[WP(Crl) 1560/2017\] for locating and then reuniting missing children with their families. This is an incredibly positive aim which we can all support. Here seems that the Delhi Police and other public authorities were not being able to achieve success. In such a situation they turned to the promises offered by facial recognition technology. 

The software for the facial recognition system as per the Indian Express report was sourced from M/s Innefu Labs Private Limited which claims [on its website](https://www.innefu.com/law-enforcement/) offers various law enforcement solutions. These include capabilities for “*a 360 degree monitoring, AI driven predictive intelligence solution*” titled as, “*Prophecy*”. We shudder at the thought that this is a vendor to the Delhi Police. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ht4w13g9si741.png?width=1043&format=png&auto=webp&s=31b908917766a62d0ce78cdc1bee0bc9e9a76f32

However, this that did not lead to much success with at least three orders of the Hon'ble High Court recording it's dissatisfaction with the facial recognition system as late as August 23, 2019. We already know such technologies are highly unreliable and scarce state resources should be used cautiously only after feasibility and rights based assessments. Stepping back, since even this High Court case contains no clear direction for the use of facial recognition software, even for instances of locating missing children a question arises, ""*What is the legal authority under which this facial recognition system is being implemented?*"". 

### Delhi Police must immediately halt mass surveillance

The facial recognition system being used in Delhi as per the Indian Express report is disturbing. We have sourced further public materials, which though limited confirm the basis of the report. All of these clearly point to multiple illegalities and harms. From building an underlying database of people from public protests to running it on crowds of people attending rallies. This directly impairs the rights of ordinary Indians from assembly, speech and political participation. 

The present facial recognition deployments cause harms that even go further. Due to the high inaccuracy rates coupled with the use of law enforcement it throws up risks of bias that have have a high probability in causing coercive action. These are all harms which stem from a scant regard to the Supreme Court's nine-judge bench judgement in case of *KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India* (2017) that reaffirmed the fundamental right to privacy. 

Concerned by this we put the Delhi Police to notice. The notice is extremely detailed and sets out the factual nuances and the several illegalities of the deployment. We are committed to taking further actions and are thankful to researchers such as [Vidushi Marda ](https://twitter.com/VidushiMarda)and [Srinivas Kodali ](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta)for helping us provide inputs. We cannot win the fight against surveillance alone. All of us need to work together. A google doc version has been made available at the bottom of the page specifically to help you to craft similar notices or consider advocacy actions.

### Further actions to safeguard you from facial recognition

We intend to focus our energies in 2020 on areas of surveillance as a priority. This includes pushing back against facial recognition not only in Delhi but across several cities in India. It builds off our past efforts including our legal notice to the NCRB's procurement of a national facial recognition system ([read more here](https://internetfreedom.in/ghost/#/editor/post/5e077e58c7acab7688a6ae14)).  From the early days of January we will work actively to ensure that India's data protection law contains surveillance reforms. 

This will continue our model framework as proposed under [\#SaveOurPrivacy ](www.saveourprivacy.in)that has been used twice by Member's of Parliament to file private members bills. If you wish to support our work in 2020, make it stronger and more effective we urge you to donate to us regularly and also share ownership of our work by becoming an IFF member today ([click here](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)).

700,"How is internet a threat to law and order?I am sure that someone here greatly appreciates the paternal care  provided to the vulnerable Indian populace by Modiji and the NDA government. It would be really great if one of them could explain to me how internet is a threat to the maintenance of law and order. I just can't bear it anymore that my friends in Kashmir or in parts of UP cannot use the internet so that some fascist supporters sense of self worth could be increased or a bigots idea of a masculine state can be achieved. 

The reluctance of our judicial institutions to ask the state this question is unacceptable especially after realizing that the high court in my state had made it clear that the right to have access to the Internet is part of the fundamental right to education as well as the right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution. If the CJI had doubts whether RTI activist is a profession then I have a doubt whether presenting yourself as the guardian of the constitution comes out as a legitimate job!",1577613006.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,17

705,"Spread of videos of police Brutality against muslims in UP is kind of alarmingThere is a widespread fear among the entire muslim community in India. The police brutality videos are fueling this fear. 

I am really concerned about this because I was talking to my dad yesterday and he referred to some videos he saw. (Just for context, he is from South and mostly watches local news, so he was not getting much information about these issues in news.) But despite the distance and disconnect from issues, he received tens of videos of violence against muslims over last two weeks. 

Honestly, I am really afraid of how polarizing affect these videos would have on the community as a whole. Here are reasons for my concern :

1. Though police is at fault, this spread of videos (real or fake) creates a biased view of system and skews their belief system, hence making the entire community irrational.
2. Islam is already on a slippery slope and a single bad move by one guy can cause terrible damage to already battered community. 

Sometimes I feel, internet stoppage is not that bad under such circumstances but even then how long can we stop it?(not saying stopping internet is right but just making a point in favor of it)

I wonder what could be done to get people out of this frenzy of viral violent videos against the community? Honestly, all these problems would not have raised, had the media been unbiased. They are seriously doing extreme damage by forcing people to rely on these unverified sources.",1577628987.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,5,43

746,"Will the conflict between India and Pakistan ever come to an end?Will peace ever prevail between these two countries?

Since 1947, both countries have been fighting with each other over the issues like kashmir and have fought 4 bloody wars with each other wasting billions of dollars fighting with each other while the people in both countries are suffering because of poverty.

It only seems to getting worse whether it be some terrorist attacks from Pakistan or the stupid kashmir move done by the BJP govt. and increasing the unrest in that place.

Religious extremism is destroying both countries. Both countries seem to be obsessed with religion rather than prosperity and progress.

Imagine if both countries actually focused on development and progress rather than thinking of destroying each other.

Combined population of both the countries is about 1.6 Billion(160 crores) which is about one-fifth or 20% of human population. However more than a quarter of this population is illitrate and both of these countries are very backward when it comes to education, science and technology progress.

Imagine if both of these countries focused on investing in education, healthcare, building economic infrastructure, empowerment of women, increasing literacy rates to 100%, improved their education systems, focusing on economic development, building scientific among the population through proper education rather than fighting over Kashmir out of which nothing was gained, it only lead to deaths of thousands of soldiers of both countries and the suffering of people in Kashmir.

It would be so better if this one-fifth population also contributed to progress of humanity and utilized it's potential.

I'd like to see humanity become a Type 1 civilisation and this means contribution from this one-fifth of humanity is also important.",1577609129.0,,Politics,dark,9,1

I can tell you quite frankly that most people have prejudices against muslims for many reasons which is either based on their experiences or what they have seen in the media or heard from others. This is very prevalent within the catholic community as well. There is a feeling of superiority mixed with feelings of fear and prejudice with regards to the muslims. Even though both religions have similar religious figures in common. This holds true for other communities and people as well. This is why by seeing protests across the country where people from all religions are coming together in solidarity is encouraging but these prejudices and misconceptions need to be tackled with. There needs to be more inter faith dialogue where all this is discussed and resolved and this is how we will actually build a more integrated and secular nation.,1577630124.0,,Politics,dark,3,56

I recently spoke with a couple of lawyers and let me share what I’ve learnt from them! 

Q: Isn’t the division discriminatory?
A: At the face value it’s discriminatory. However if you examine, All the three countries are “Islamic Republic Nations”, so the division

Q: Non-Muslims from the 3 countries can apply for citizenship of India will be granted directly
A: No, they have to be in India for 5 years before they can apply for citizenship and an additional 1 year is used as a reference before it is granted.

Q: What about Muslims
A: They also have to go through the same process, but they have to be in India for 10 years and one year as the reference.

Q: What about NorthEast
A: This is rather troublesome for Northeast. They’re requesting for exclusion, which is doable. However, we still have to solve the problem of people who immigrate illegally for work each day.

Q: What about NRC
A: it’s good. This should have been done long ago. But we are doing it now. We don’t have any clue as to where and how’s of the people. NRC will solve that. It has two sections of which the first one asks for at least one of 16 basic documents

Q: Is NRC introduced by the current government?
A: No! It was proposed initially by Rajeev Gandhi 

Q: Do you think it’s discriminatory 
A: NO

Q: What do you think about protests(West Bengal)
A: They’re being done by those whose citizenship is in question

Q: Why is congress protesting against NRC if it’s introduced by Rajeev Gandhi
A: It’s politics man!

Q: If is not discriminatory, why is UN involved?
A: It’s their job to understand any tumults in a country and seek an answer to the situation

Now credit card penetration is very low in India and there's a high chance this person paid by debit card, doesn't even try to dispute the charge because he feels he can't do it.

This stupid line gets upvoted and its generally suggested to beg the merchant for a refund or consumer court and all that.

So to clarify, if you have any Visa/MC card, doesn't matter credit or debit, you can dispute your charges. Your bank forwards the dispute to them and the payment processors look into it. 

The only disadvantage here is that you don't pay right away for the disputed transaction, there's a high probability that within the 30 day window of paying your credit card bill, the dispute would be resolved. But you still **get your money back.**

I must say doing this to an *elected representative* is underming democracy at the best and a coup at worst and supreme Court has no jurisdiction over this. It was because of this arbitrary act of the supreme Court that she later declared emergency. 
Also P.N. Bhagwati was a RSS supporter and his brother was is a free-marketeer. Indira actually tried to do what the Constitution promised but was stopped by entrenched interests.

You have been physically involved in this downward trend when you stood for hours in queue in front of banks during Notebandi; and let’s not forget Make in India, Digital India, Onion price, GDP, Assam NRC, unemployment, poverty etc. And now, the trailer ‘CAA’ is released for the movie ‘NRC’ which has been cleared by censor board (Parliament).

By the looks of the trailer and preview of the movie, the condition of India may become really bad. Thus, it is on us (viewers) to decide whether we go and buy tickets to watch the movie or even download using torrent once it releases. If we do not act now, we will soon be knocking on heavens door.

My father and I wear traditional Indian clothes and during the mass there was a clear announcement that the communion is only meant for roman catholics. My father was among the first to approach the priest for communion and the priest stopped him saying that it is only for Catholics, my father immediately informed him that he was a catholic and was given the communion. After the mass  the priest was decent enough to approach and apologise to my father for his mistake and said he was unsure as my father was hesitating before he was to receive communion, my father replied that he was hesitating to allow an elderly person to receive communion. 

We all know the reason behind this. It is because we were wearing traditional Indian clothes and not western clothes like most roman Catholics wear. This has followed me all my life as I’m thought that Hindus or basically non catholic as I wear Indian clothes. I’ve had many people ask me and also be shocked to find out that I’m catholic. There are so many issues that need to be unpacked here and need to change here. I’ve written about this on social media before.

**Summary :**

SPEAKING about the contentious [Citizenship (Amendment) Act](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-how-to-be-a-citizen-of-india-earlier-now-6165960/) and the [National Register of Citizens](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/) ([NRC](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/)) plan that have sparked protests across the country, Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said that a “proper legal process” will be followed for a nation-wide NRC, including consultation with state governments, and that “some” data collected for the National Population Register (NPR) “may or may not be used” for the NRC.

Asked when the NRC would be implemented, Prasad told The Sunday Express, “A position has to be taken. There is a legal process. First a decision, second a notification, then the process, the verification, the objection, the hearing of the objection, right of appeal. There will be a consultation with the state government, feedback will be taken. If anything is to be done, it will be done publicly. Nothing will be a secret on an NRC.”

I think the best way to deal with / respond to BJP propaganda is not to fall into their trap and get into a ""tu tu main main"" with them.

Stick to your agenda, your narrative, your own strengths and get your message across in a Positive and decent way.

Be Honest and Open and the public will appreciate you for it. 

Dont think citicising everything that the BJP does (like the congress) is creating a positive impression in people's minds.

1021,"Launched a plaform to reduce internet/call scams in India, do you like the idea?Internet/Call based scams have grown significantly in recent years. I've seen countless Facebook posts in groups where people talked about how they got scammed. I realized the problem with posting them on Facebook is that only group members would know about the scams and rest of the world would probably never know of it. To tackle this problem of scams in India. I came up with an idea, why not build a platform where people can share their story of being scammed and help fellow netizens by telling how it could have been avoided? After few hours, I came up with a basic site, a community-driven platform [WatchScams.com](https://WatchScams.com) where people can share their story of being scammed which would help others.

&#x200B;

It's still in BETA, I've posted about one recent growing scam myself and would really appreciate if members can share their story of being scammed (like they already do in group) and help others. Please note that its limited to internet/call based scams (or anything related to tech in general)

&#x200B;

I don't intend to make money with this, it's completely free and open for everyone. As a responsible netizen, that's the least I could do to fight scams and make web a better place for my country. If you like my work and would love to make web a better place. Consider sharing about it. :)

Excerpts from article :

\-  “The PM is saying something, the Home Minister is telling something else,” says Zaheer Alam at Jhaal Chittoda. “Ek zubaan ho toh hisaab samajh aye. Do zuban ka koi kya samjhe (If they said one thing, one could understand. What does one make of this doublespeak)?”

“Under CAA, you are going to provide documents to those coming from outside, but under the NRC you are asking documents from everyone here. What for?” asks Mohammed Rizwan, a scrapdealer in his mid-30s, as others around him nod, at Manna Mazra.

&#x200B;

\- While praising the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana for benefiting Hindus and Muslims alike, Asgar Abbas of Sirsi in Sambhal district says the goodwill is depleting. “Whom to believe? Which documents do they need? 1970 or 1989?” asks Abbas.

Sirsi is about 10 km from Sambhal, where two protestors were killed during recent clashes with police.

A worried Mumtaz Jahan of Karula-Sir Syed Nagar in Moradabad says their area saw a peaceful protest recently. “How do we get documents of our ancestors? Where will I go searching when I have lived here on rent for decades now?” he says.

&#x200B;

\-  Masarat Alarm, a daily wager in his 30s at Sirsi, says he hasn’t got work in 15 days. “Those who have land can get documents. What about labourers like us?” he adds.

Raees Ahmed, a labourer at a woodwork shop near Karula-Sir Syed Nagar, admits he doesn’t know the exact details about CAA, adding, “Charcha kahe ki, kharcha nikalna mushkil ho raha hai (We don’t have time for all this, we can barely make ends meet).”

&#x200B;

\-  Mehboob Ahmed of Amehda asks if BJP governments anywhere else — citing the Jat, Patel and Maratha protests (in Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra, respectively) — had similarly sought dues from protesters.

For now, the anger is restricted to the government and has not become communal. “Yeh masla Hindu aur Muslim ke beech ka nahin hai. Yeh masla prashashan ke khilaf hai (This is not an issue of Hindus and Muslims. It’s an issue with the government),” says Hanif, a mason in his mid-50s, at Saifkhan Sarai in Sambhal.

“We want Hindu-Muslim peace and amity,” adds a labourer, Riasat, in Islamnagar locality of Milak in Rampur district.

**Summary of the Opinion Pace by Kapil Sibal :**

\- Bhakts then contend that this was part of the [BJP](https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/)’s manifesto, and having won by a bigger margin in 2019, the legislation is no more than honouring its commitment to the people. Again, the argument is a non-starter. A commitment cannot be clothed with legality merely because a majoritarian government got it passed in Parliament. Even if the law passes the test of legality, it may still be repressive, can instil fear and target communities.

\- They only seek to clear the way for members of certain persecuted communities, including Hindus, to be conferred the status of citizens, even if they have illegally entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. The assumption is that they illegally entered India because they were persecuted in these Islamic countries whereas Muslims who entered India without papers were mere illegal migrants.

\- There are serious fallacies in this argument. First, one wonders how the government knows of the individual intentions of all non-Muslim illegal immigrants. Two, none of them have claimed at the time that they entered India illegally that they were being persecuted. Nor have they made any such claim thereafter to any authority in India. One wonders how the BJP, and that too in 2019, came to the conclusion that all non-Muslims namely Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis were all persecuted when they illegally entered India.

\- In the 2019 election manifesto, the BJP mentioned the problem of illegal immigration (not “refugees”) in the Northeast and committed to address that problem by initiating a [National Register of Citizens](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/) ([NRC](https://indianexpress.com/about/nrc/)) in Assam, to be expanded in phases to the rest of India. In it, the BJP also committed to enact a [Citizenship Amendment Bill](https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/citizenship-amendment-bill-2019-parliament-winter-session-nrc-6122846/) for the protection of individuals of religious minority communities from neighbouring countries escaping persecution and to also clear the apprehensions of those living in Assam who had agitated against all (whether “Hindu or Muslim”) illegal migrants’ entry into the state which threatened to destabilise their socio-cultural identity. There was no mention of limiting this exercise to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

\- The answer perhaps lies in the fact that lakhs of Hindus were excluded from the NRC in Assam. An attempt was made, first in the Supreme Court, to reject the exercise and carry out a review. That did not work. For the BJP, to allow such exclusion of Hindus to continue, would have been politically suicidal. The only way out was to initiate the CAB to declare all illegal immigrants, other than Muslims, as having been persecuted in the three named Islamic countries through a legislative presumption.

\- If this is allowed, the next step is an NRC exercise in the rest of the country designed to deny all Muslims with no documents the status of citizens. Others who also have no papers will be presumed to have been persecuted, and will therefore be granted the status of citizens.

\- This demonic political agenda must not succeed. If it does, our body politic will have been amputated and our Republic scarred. Those rejected will lose their homeland, and we, our brothers and sisters. A partition of exclusion is in the offing. If it happens, the outcome is anybody’s guess.

1082,"How to get birth certificate in Tamil Nadu: A guide [OC]This guide is only for the State of Tamil Nadu. I know nothing about other states. Can't help you with that and I hope someone else does it for your state.

Irrespective of your position on the CAA/NRC, prudence dictates that necessary steps be taken in preparation to ensure a hassle free process. So, this is a guide (restricted to birth certificate - will do others if its requested) to either get an updated birth certificate or to apply for a new one. Tamil Nadu has one of the best birth and death registration rates and hopefully, anyone born after 1990 can immediately get their birth certificate from their corporation website (unless you were ""naturally delivered"" in a sintex tank and have been living under a rock). For this guide, I'll illustratively take the district of Chennai and demonstrate:

Go to the corporation of Chennai website - you will find a tab for ""Birth/Death Certificates"" - click on that which will take you to an option called ""verification/printing of birth certificate"" - it will take you to the search page wherein you will find two options - basic search and advanced search. 

If you are born after 1990, you can adopt the advanced search route  by filling in your name - date of birth - leave the place of birth as not known - do not enter the name of your father or mother (leave it blank - If you fill it up, for some fucked up reason the site will return a error message most of the time) - fill in the verification number and click submit. Your electronic birth certificate, digitally signed by the City Health Officer will be generated as a pdf file. Thats it - you have got your verified and updated birth certificate. This is a free service provided by the TN Government and don't shell money by doing this same process through a broker. Thats it - you have got your verified and updated birth certificate.

If your or someone else's birth was not registered at all, you can apply for it with your corporation for a new issuance. Upto one year from the date of birth, there is free registration. Beyond one year, an application fee of Rs 10/- has to be paid. 

If the birth is within 6 years from the date of application, the following documents are required: (a) Parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license. (b) Filled in application. 

If the birth is prior to 6 years from the date of application, the following documents are required:(a) Bona fide certificate from the school which mentions the child's name, date of birth and father's name; (b) Parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license/PAN Card/Passport; (c) Filled in application. 

If the birth is prior to 15 years from the date of application, the following documents are required:(a) SSLC certificate; (b) parent's identification & address proof - family card/voter id/aadhar card/driving license/PAN Card/Passport; (c) Filled in application; (d) An affidavit on a Rs20/- stamp paper by the parents sworn before a notary public on the date of birth of the child. The affidavit must also be affixed with the photographs of the parents and the child. 

Also have the following documents ready, if you have them: (a) Ante-natal care card of the mother; (b) Post Natal Care Card of the Child; (c) The certificate provided by the Hospital on birth; (d) If its a home delivery: A letter attesting birth at home by two members of the public who are familiar with your family; (e) If you dont have anything, there may be an inspection report from the health department who will attest to your birth at your home by making field inquiries (Usually this is an option given to the officers to make some money).[There is a list of 9 documents required by the corporation in some cases for ""thorough verification"" - you can find that list in tamil in the website].

Usually, generation of a new birth registration and issuance of a certificate takes almost two months. If there is a work load, which you can expect there to be if the CAA/NRC proceeds in full steam, the time for issuance can be expected to be almost tripled. 

So act soon, get your affairs in order and help to get your neighbor/friend their documents ready. Spread the awareness. Dont let them be a prey to the brokers who thrive on emergency/desperate situations to charge a fucking lumpsum towards a simple job.

They are not going to be interested in absorbing another 2 million refugees from India. 

Let's assume these Bengalis are made stateless, will the federal gov actually deport them to Bangladesh? What happens if the Bangladeshi gov refuse to accept them?

[ Amidst continuing protests over the new citizenship law and a proposed nationwide NRC, Union Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Saturday said that only those who are ready to say “Bharat Mata Ki Jai” should be allowed to live in India. ](https://preview.redd.it/6zhidtz89h741.jpg?width=759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bc345200f69fedaf56c6a14e0008084eed9ab43c)

 Addressing the 54th state conference of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the RSS, Pradhan on Saturday said, ""(What is challenge before this country today? On one side, this country’s citizenship… to be counted or not? Would Udham Singh’s sacrifice go in vain? Would Bhagat Singh’s sacrifice go in vain? Would Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose’s sacrifice go in vain? Did the crores of people who fought for Independence do so so that 70 years after Independence, this country would discuss whether we should count our citizens or not? Do we want to make this country to be an inn? Should anyone who comes to this country be allowed to live here? We have to face this challenge. This point has to be made clear. In India, one will have to say Bharat Mata ki Jai. Only those people will be able to live here),” Pradhan said, adding that most countries in the world had a provision for registering their citizens. 

 “The country’s journey into the 21st century will no doubt have ABVP as its fulcrum point, a reference and leading body. Value-based education and entrepreneurship will be the core of this journey. I have been associated with ABVP since 1983, with my biggest accomplishment being the national secretary of ABVP,” Pradhan said.",1577584019.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,11,63

To tackle this problem of scams in India. I came up with an idea, why not build a platform where people can share their story of being scammed and help fellow netizens by telling how it could have been avoided? After few hours, I came up with a basic site, a community-driven platform [WatchScams.com](https://WatchScams.com) where people can share their story of being scammed which would help others.

&#x200B;

It's still in BETA, I've posted about one recently growing scam myself and would really appreciate if members can share their story of being scammed and help others. Please note that its limited to internet/call based scams (or anything related to tech in general) 

&#x200B;

I don't intend to make money with this, it's completely free and open for everyone. As a responsible netizen, that's the least I could do to fight scams and make web a better place for my country. If you like my work and would love to make web a better place. Consider sharing about it. :)

* The most important amendment to the Citizenship Act in 2003 was the insertion of the need for the National Register of Indian Citizens, something which is equivalent to the NRC conducted in Assam.

“The Editors Guild of India has noted with deep dismay and concern the deplorable act of Amit Malviya, the head of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s Information Technology cell, in which he conducted an offensive, McCarthyist social media ‘poll’ on noted journalist Rajdeep Sardesai,” said the Guild, of which Sardesai is a former president.

It added: “The poll on Twitter was not only tasteless, it also questioned the integrity and patriotism of Mr Sardesai, who is a journalist of standing and a former President of the Editors Guild of India.”

The Guild said the poll raises questions on the BJP’s commitment to free speech and urged the party to reprimand Malviya.

“The Twitter poll by a national head of the BJP also raises questions on the party’s commitment to healthy debate and dissent without allowing disagreement to degenerate into abuse,” the Guild said. “The Guild urges Mr Malviya to immediately withdraw the so-called Twitter poll, and the BJP to caution him strongly.”

 **Malviya, however, has refused to back down.** He tweeted again later in the day, responding to a Sardesai tweet on the Citizenship Amendment Act protests, again making the PR reference.",1577561230.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,40

1181,"Please help! Share her story. A late professor's wife is seeking death gratuity and family pension since 22 months.TL:DR; A professor at University of Allahabad passed away 22 months ago, at the age of 41. Despite persistent efforts, it remains unclear how and when his family will receive death gratuity and family pension. He was enrolled in the National Pension System. Please retweet, share the request letter of his wife, who is seeking help from Government.

I am posting this seeking help and a community effort in raising a grave concern to the Central Government of India. 

I write to you as a student from Centre of Behavioural and Cognitive Sciences, University of Allahabad. Almost two years ago, our Centre lost Prof. V.S. Chandrashekar Pammi to an untimely death. He died on the night of February 11th 2018 due to a cardiac arrest. He was 41 years old. Even with a relatively short academic career he contributed significantly to the field of cognitive science and made efforts to establish its roots in India. He is now survived by his wife Bhanumathi Devi and their nine year old son. 

His wife has been facing hardships due to non-release of death gratuity and family pension from the National Pension System. She has been making efforts since 22 months to no avail. The University wrote on her behalf to the UGC few months ago, UGC then forwarded the matter to MHRD, and MHRD has said the matter is under consideration. For over 18 months, she has been writing RTIs, complaints and enquiry emails to various Government departments. She has been told that hers is the first such case under NPS (National Pension System) and MHRD needs to make further considerations before any decision is taken. 

Neither the University, nor UGC or MHRD have been able to help her. There is no assurance of the matter being solved in the near future either. She has had to shift homes from Allahabad back to her hometown and continues to face unfortunate logistic and financial hardships.

Prof. V.S. Chandrashekar Pammi was a cognitive scientist that worked at University of Allahabad for a little more than 9 years, and gained his professorship there. He contributed immensely to the field of cognitive science and decision making. Not only for science, but even in his immediate community, he made true efforts to bring about positive change. 

This is the link to where his wife is trying to raise the issue with Government on twitter. I request you to share it or retweet it and join her in helping her issue across to the Government: https://twitter.com/DeviBhanumathi/status/1210862933179133952

1186,"A perspective on Indian policeI copied the following from a Facebook friend's wall. Being a dalit myself I have experienced numerous traumatic injustice from the police but not on this scale.


[CW/TW: Police Brutality, Caste Violence, Rape, Violence against women]

Let me tell you a blood-stained story of UP Police, something that I had seen as a child, and it still gives me shivers to think about it. In fact, all the police violence in recent days has been triggering flashbacks to that time and it has taken me a lot of courage to put this down into words. 

But it needs to be written. The Police has started doing it again, as they have done on countless occasions in the past. And we cannot stop it unless we know the monster that controls these puppets. 

Savarna liberals from the cities need to know how India has always been like, how Police has always worked. Because the nation they grew up in, and the nation we grew up in - are two different nations. And even though we may share the same geology, our worlds are just not same in any way. 

[PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS IS A RECOLLECTION OF EXTREMELY TRIGGERING AND DISTURBING EVENTS, SO DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE NOT IN THE EMOTIONAL STATE TO PROCESS SOMETHING LIKE THIS. I DO NOT MEAN THIS LIGHTLY.]

Also, if you want to share this story - copy and paste it, do not share my name. 

2002. 

In our village, almost nobody had a toilet so everyone had to go to the open fields. Men went during the sundown, and women could go only when it was dark and they wouldn't be seen. Women went together in large groups, stayed close and they talked to each other the whole time. It was a way for women to let each other know that they were safe.

One woman getting silent even for a while used to create panic. They had to be speaking all the time while they were out in the dark. This was the story of women every night, this was the life they lived. 

A day came when there was a foul feeling in the air, women were terrified and men panicked - now women started going to the fields earlier in the twilight rather than going in the dark as usual - preferring to return when there was still some light in the sky. They carried small knives and one or two men went with them, carrying batons to stand guard at a distance.

I was nine years old, and obviously nobody told me what was happening.

One day, while coming back from school, I heard some Brahmins from the village in conversation at the local tea shop. One of them was loudly narrating a story that he thought he had the right to brandish in public. He was describing a rape.

One of his cousins, named Markanday Shukla, was the rapist. There was a Yadav woman who used to work in his fields for weeding out grass, feeding his cows, cleaning the cowdung, and did more of such work. One day, he made a pass at her, which was not reciprocated by her and then he began to sexually harrass her day after day.

Of course, in the language of the narrator at the tea shop, it was all very filmy and clever and macho.

Then, one day he attempted to rape the Yadav woman but she managed to escape his house and ran back to her home. Next day, he kidnapped the woman's niece who was returning from school and kept her at his home, asking the woman to give in and let him have his way with her.

Yadav men erupted in rage, but they didn't have the courage to go up to his house - he had dozens of guns and other weapons at his place.

The woman was moved someplace else during the night, and the men made a plan to sneak into his house and retrieve the girl. By the time they reached, they found the girl unconscious and the Brahmins had already raped her.

Of course, in the language of the narrator at the tea shop, it was a story of triumph and dominance.

She was brought home, and after a few days of recovery they decided to go to the Police.

The Police were already the lackeys of Brahmins in the area, they laughed at the victim and her family, and made them wait outside the Police Station for hours. While they were waiting, Markanday showed up there.

Then one of the constables came outside, and called the girl in. Rest of the family was sent away, saying that the girl will be safer inside the police station than at their home. 

Then they raped her again. Markanday and the Police.

The Police repeatedly raped her for many days, and whenever her family came they were turned away by saying the girl was moved to a bigger police station for her own safety.

And then they killed her. Her body was found inside the river many days later.

Of course, in the language of the narrator at the tea shop, it was very hilarious and ironical.

The people listening to him laughed dryly, like it was some kind of stale joke. 

I was shell-shocked and came back home fuming with anger and so much grief.

This incident broke something inside the Yadav people of the village, and they begun collecting guns and other weapons over the course of coming years. They wanted to rival the Brahmins of the village, and did not want to be weak anymore.

It took only one attempted attack at one Brahmin by one Yadav, that the police came and arrested every Yadav man who had a firearm in the house. All the houses were searched, ransacked, and their weapons taken. All the Yadav men were thrown into jail by putting on them relentless charges of assault and attempted murder.

Such was the situation that there was no adult male left in the Yadav community of the village, and the women were repeatedly assaulted by Brahmins of the village. Men still remained in jail.

Most of them are not out of jail till date. Some those who come out, do not get to enjoy the fresh air for too long, as they are advised to lay low and just handle their households, otherwise the Police scoops them in as soon as they show any sign of activity in public sphere.

Over the time, the next generation of Yadav men, those who belonged to my age group - grew up with trauma and caution, knowing how to keep their head down and to stay out of trouble. They still collected weapons discreetly, to protect themselves in the case of any violent event but they did not actively retaliate.

Their broken spirit and self-esteem was fostered by some other Brahmins, who offered sympathy and support to these boys. These other Brahmins took them in and made the Yadav kids do their housework and fieldwork, they made them their pawns and soldiers to settle their petty fights. Many a times you'd see Yadav kids fighting each other like the chicken fights of the old - while the upper caste strata watched and placed bets.

They even used the minor differences between Yadavs to turn them against each other, they used the incident of that heinous rape and spread stories about which people among the Yadavs were supportive and which were not - creating animosity and divide. 

Within a decade, there were factions in the Yadav community based on which Brahmins they supported and the factions started fighting with each other. Many murders took place and more of them were thrown into jail.

Now there are very few adult Yadav men left in the community, as most of them have been in jail for years. Those who are out and those who never went to jail, now do nothing except tend to their fields and buffaloes.

They still fight each other, but not lethally - and as long as they don't murder anyone, and pose no danger to the Brahmin establishment, the Police doesn't bother. It's all fine as long as they just fight each other or they fight for the Brahmins.

They celebrate Brahminical festivals, worship their gods, one of the Yadavs was able to collect enough money to even build a temple. 

Markanday left the village somewhere around 2008, and now he is a millionaire priest in Haridwar where he owns vast swathes of land and a mutt. He had returned in 2014, to perform a mahayajna where the entire village had to pay up to cover the cost of the ceremony. Those who weren't able to pay, their belongings and grains were taken. When the yajna was being performed, they had created a boundary around it - which the lower castes were not supposed to cross, they could only do ""darshan"" from outside the boundary. 

Police force was there for ""security"" reasons, which was mostly to keep the lower castes out since they got too enthusiastic about the worship. The same police was nowhere to be seen when the Brahmin boys went house to house for extorting money and robbing the poor. 

This is what the function of UP Police has always been. 

It is nothing more than a glorified lackey. 

The liberal discourse in India criticizes Police for corruption, ineptitude and their lack of empathy - but never traces the root of such avarices, which lie in the conditioning of Brahminism. Police has to be corrupt, inept, and entirely devoid of a moral compass to be able to serve as the bullying arm of the Brahminical colonialism. 

If you are questioning the brutality of the Police, but not the bloodthirsty master that it serves - your argument is pointless.

When Police is torching the Muslim houses, and seizing their property, destroying their belongings, and putting them in jail - your criticism of police or government serves no purpose because they are just tools. Police is a tool. Government is a tool. And tools change, but the oppression remains eternal. The real malice is the curse of Brahminism that has been laying waste to this land and our people for more than three thousand years. 

You criticize the weapon but not the murderer. 

The Prime Minister, the Chief Minister, the politicians - are just ornate masks of the vile and elusive ghost that haunts this land. 

I don't understand why the liberals can only see the atrocities that are happening right now, but do not realize that the nation they live in and cherish so dearly was built upon the sweat, blood, and bones of the our people. 

The horrors you see now, have always been the reality of most people who sadly do not live in this nation - despite being on the same land, their nation is out of reach of democracy and deep inside the cruel claws of Brahminism. 

This is exactly the India, we all grew up in. This is exactly the India we know.

But we feel comfortable spewing vitriol against literally everything else other than the root cause of all problems in the society.

But Indians have grown up with the idea of protest so firmly entrenched in our minds that whenever we see someone talk about Bhagat Singh or Gandhi or Ambedkar, even the toughest of us feel a little bit of empathy. These personalities and stories are so central to Indian life that you can't help but be drawn to people who emulate them.

This is why I've always believed that no tyrant can rule India for a long period of time. There is too much of Gandhi and Bhagat Singh still alive in our public imagination.

2. Your kid being born in the USA is not a proof of his US citizenship

1262,"Story time..*A whatsapp chat I wrote to my girlfriend explaining what's happening with Ashok Lavasa*


During elections in 2019, when everyone was campaigning, people were saying unconstitutional stuff to win votes.

Both secular and hindu parties alike. This is why election commission (henceforth the 'EC') was asking them to get debarred from public appearances. Example. Mayawati and yogi adityanath got debarred.

A little detour to tell you more about the EC. It is a 3 member body, each member called an election commissioner. Main person is called chief election commissioner (CEC) but has almost equal powers as the other 2 commissioners. All three are typically retired IAS officers.

Anyway, coming back to the topic.. this is always a little tricky because people give inflammatory speeches and then the EC has to decide when to censure (debar) them or not. This decision is taken as a vote of three people. And anyone not agreeing will have to give a vote of dissent.

So this time, there has been a lot of controversy as usual.
Traditionally, the EC has been a super powerful body, reprimanding politicians for untoward behaviour and censuring them. Modi and Shah made tonnes of irresponsible statements, as expected but everytime anyone raised objections, EC said no nothing wrong said. Which is well within their rights, so that's alright.

But this decision was often [dissented](https://theprint.in/india/left-irrelevant-meaningless-in-poll-panel-meets-dissenting-ec-ashok-lavasa-tells-cec/237018/) by 1 officer out of 3 , called ashok Lavasa

Long story short, nothing came of it, so the matter got closed after elections.

But now is the time for the govt to start retribution.
So the cbi/ed registered cases against ashok Lavasa ka son and his wife, and they had to [quit](https://theprint.in/india/election-commissioner-ashok-lavasas-son-quits-job-over-ed-probe-wife-to-resign-as-well/334874/) their respective jobs.

Now the govt of India is practically coming after the whole family of ashok Lavasa.

So in response to that, ashok Lavasa has written an article today in the indianexpress regarding honesty and ethicality
, which is a fascinating read.

And that's the context I wanted to give you before I sent you the link to this.
 https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-difficulty-of-being-honest-prevention-of-corruption-act-ashok-lavasa-election-commission-of-india-6188078/

Do have a look. The man's been punished for something that's right. He's come out and has gracefully dealt with what has happened to him with this fine piece of writing. He isn't naming or shaming anyone, although he may have been forgiven had he gone down that road. He empathises with his peers who he subtely claims are timid but ultimately kind hearted, he points at his political masters ever so slightly for this to get lost in translation. This is the epitome of how to deal with a difficult boss and ensuing retribution in both political and corporate arenas. 

What a man.

1263,"How do you make acquaintance with the opposite sex?This post isn't meant to asking for suggestion. This is to know how you people make friendships in general. I am a 27 year old guy working at a shop. I don't have any female friends (or males) except in online. I only get to interact with male customers in general. Sometimes when I look outside and see people, I wonder how they get acquainted. Yeah, some will be in school, some will become friends at college. What about after that? Work, I guess. I wasn't fortunate enough to working in an office environment so I could have interacted with females or educated people in general. So, outside work, how else then? Growing up in a lower middle class family in India, I wasn't allowed to talk with girls much. Being an adult now,  I could not approach women given the situations in India because of some one sided love creeps and degenerates. They will be either scared of us strangers or they will shy away because of how society will see men and women 'talking'. So can't blame them for that. So, how else? How do you make acquaintance with the opposite sex? This doesn't have to be about love or close friendships or business. All my life I have been either a stranger or somebodies online best friend. Don't bother using paper cut quotes like go out, join a club, do some social helping. Because I am not asking for help. I am wondering about how else you guys are doing.

One of the best songs to sing together is the REST of the Bharat Bhagya Vidhata song. It's first part is our national anthem, but the rest 4 stanzas, especially the second one, are so much relevant.

Also in Japan. It's translated in at least 14 different languages and all of them sing the same song in same tune, just in the native languages.

It wasn't a usual donation type. As people typically don't give a damn and were leaving, he started to scream on the top of his lungs. Crying and begging for help. There were a few others who stood outside the gate with a Chanda cloth and reiterating to everyone what he said inside. At first I thought he was just an ordinary man, but as the tone sounded familiar, it clicked to me that he was indeed a Kashmiri. He came outside in despair, seeing that he couldn't gather the attention he assumed he would get. Like the amount of people he thought would sympathize with him or the reaction idk. He goes to the parking lot and says,""We are being looted, our lives have become very difficult to live... I come from the same place where the Pulwama attacks took place..""

This reminded me of a similar incident when I went to pick up my vehicle from the service centre. It was during Ramadhan, a Kashmiri man approached and narrated in brief what was going on with them.

At first you are skeptical like any human being. You have your doubts. You know how beggars play with you. But on the other hand, you could see the scare in his eyes.

“**The Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank (ADCB) secured deposits of Rs 745.59 crore of the spiked notes.”**  
**The** ***New Indian Express*****, Times Now, Firstpost (June 2018)**

On 21 and 22 June last year, several Indian news websites published a story by the news agency Indo Asian News Service. The article states that district cooperative banks were only allowed to accept deposits of the banned currency notes for six days after demonetisation was announced, till 14 November. During this time, a right-to-information query revealed, the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank, secured the highest amount of demonetised notes, worth Rs 745.59 crore, among cooperative banks. The BJP national president Amit Shah served as a director of the bank at that time.

On 22 June, [The Wire reported](https://thewire.in/media/amit-shah-bank-demonetisation-news18-new-indian-express) that the news websites including Firstpost, the Times Group’s news channel Times Now, and the *New Indian Express*, owned by Express Publications (Madurai) Limited retracted the story within two days without offering an explanation. Hardev Sanotra, the managing editor of the IANS defended the report and told [the fact-checking website BOOM](https://www.boomlive.in/et-deletes-amit-shah-from-demonetisation-story-other-websites-take-down/), “We stand by our story. It is based on facts and RTI. We have nothing to hide.”",1577529701.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,1

1360,"BJP affiliate’s survey claims majority for party in 2020 Delhi Assembly polls A survey conducted by the Global Young Action Network (GYAN) Foundation, a group of young professionals affiliated to the BJP, has predicted a majority win for the saffron party in the national capital in the Delhi elections. 

**The survey conducted with a sample size of 46,526 respondents, said that the party would win 42 seats. While the city has 70 Assembly seats, the survey was conducted in 62 constituencies. It predicted that the ruling Aam Aadmi Party would only retain 25 seats while the Congress might wrest control on three seats in Delhi**

GYAN Foundation founder Sumeet Bhasin said according to findings, **the BJP will be getting 46.6 per cent vote share, the AAP 31.8 per cent, and the Congress will be restricted to 15.4 per cent. ""The survey shows AAP MLAs in very negative light, almost 65 per cent respondent have either very poor or poor opinion against sitting MLAs of the ruling party,"" he said**. In the 2015 elections, the Congress had drawn a blank while the AAP had won 67 seats and the BJP emerged victorious in the remaining three constituencies.  

**Over 68 per cent felt that Kejriwal was responsible for the rise in air pollution in the city. In the survey, 61 per cent of the respondents were of the opinion that the BJP must not declare its chief ministerial candidate before the Delhi election. Only 18 per cent of the respondents favoured for the announcement of the chief ministerial candidate before the election**

## Tl;dr

There has been a growing use of drones by policing departments across India. Quite often these are deployed across peaceful protests to record the movements of people and pose a risk to their privacy. They also may fly close to crowds threatening injury and causing anxiety. These concerns made us look more closely as to their legal framework and to our shock we discovered that these are completely illegal. We wrote to the Office of the Director General of Civil Aviation urging for urgent action.

## Legality of Drones

Last year India has come up with an ambitious regulatory system for remotely piloted aircraft systems (“drones”). This was done under provisions of the the Aircraft Act, 1934 and Aircraft Rules, 1937. Under this legal framework the the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) has been vested with exclusive powers to regulate the use and operation of drones (read more here).

Broadly under it, all such drones have to first be under specific makes and models which have been permitted by the DGCA. Secondly, they have to be registered as per the regulatory system. As per an answer provided by the Hon’ble Minister of State for Civil Aviation dated December 12, 2019 in the Lok Sabha there are only six micro and small drones legally approved by the DGCA. To our shock and surprise this is being flouted by police departments across India.

## Violations a plenty

Yesterday during one of the protests in Delhi one such violation was brought to our notice making us write an urgent letter to the DGCA in the evening.

* **Fundamental right to privacy:** These violations are in the nature of the use of the drone which is firstly deployed with a camera by the Delhi Police. To our preliminary analysis this would ordinarily conflict with the constitutional right to privacy as laid down by the Supreme Court. It is important to consider that the privacy right under the judgement applies even in public spaces. Such acts of mass surveillance need to be done only on the basis of legality, necessity and proportionality.
* **Violation of DGCA Rules:** Second and more worryingly it seems that the use of such drones is beyond the permitted categories, makes and models as permitted by the DGCA. Notably, the Delhi police has been found to be using drones manufactured by DJI systems (specifically DJI Phantom) which are beyond these permitted categories as per the Reply to Question No. 356 as referred above.

Based on these violations we swung into action and have written to the DGCA. We demand for a cease to the use of drones by police departments, an independent legal opinion and their subsequent confiscation. We are thankful to [Srinivas Kodali ](https://twitter.com/digitaldutta)for helping us provide inputs and prompting us to take rapid action.

Even more broadly, this again underscores why a comprehensive data protection law with surveillance reforms is an urgent need for India today. Unfortunately the existing draft data protection has wide exemptions and poorly protects you. We have a better model over at #SaveOurPrivacy which has been used twice by Member's of Parliament to file private members bills.

A couple of years back I went abroad to study. My father transfered some emergency money to my European bank account. This money remained unused. Last year, I came back to India. I left my European account open in case I needed to go back, but that didn't materialise.

Now, I need to use the funds in my European bank account in India. A direct transaction is not possible. Therefore, I have to first transfer the amount to my Indian bank account, and then spend it here. 

Now, if I transfer that amount (which is larger than RS 50000), will I have to pay tax on it? 

If it was a gift from someone else, i would have to pay tax on this amount. But the European account is my own, it's in my name only. 

Will this transfer be taxable?

____

More Noob-ish additional question:  When can we start asking for the authority's **direct resignation** for not listening to public's outcries?

It's clear that the government is clearly ignorant about the public's concerns over the new laws. They keep insisting we are wrong yet wouldn't hold a presser with the media to clear up the doubts. 

If you think the protesters are misguided then come and talk to us!
If one's intentions are in good faith then why would one sit silent. 

I understand they had clear majority so no chance of a dismissal by normal process. 

Can people ask the resignation because they no longer believe the government is acting in their favor (which is evident), is a pathological liar and slammed by their own countrymen, as well as international institutions like UN (useless), and Government is also not making any attempts to clear the 'doubts' as they call it, whats the point of following orders when conversation is not two way at all.",1577457337.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,13,55

1492,"Tv Superstar Kushal Punjabi in his suicide note: ‘No one responsible for my death’The Bandra police said on Friday that they found a suicide note from the flat in which read, “There is no one responsible for my suicide.”

**In his suicide note, written in English, Kushal Punjabi has mentioned that 50 per cent of his property/assets should be equally distributed among his parents and sister, and the remaining 50 per cent should be given to his three-year-old son Kian**.

Police officers investigating the death said Punjabi stopped taking calls on Thursday. His parents were trying to reach him since 2 pm( his last insta post was abt his son at 12 pm), but he never responded. Subsequently, they decided to visit him.

**Punjabi’s parents reached his apartment around 10:30 in the night, and found the door locked. They had a spare key, and used it to open the door around 10.50 pm
He was found Kushal hanging with nylon rope.Around 11:10 PM they  informed the cops**

Kushal Punjabi tied the knot with his European girlfriend Audrey Dolhen in 2015. The couple has a three-year-old son Kian. **According to reports, Kushal Punjabi was suffering from clinical depression and was on anti-depressants. His marriage of four years had also hit a rough patch and was disturbed due to the separation**

Kushal Punjabi's last Instagram posts were all about his son Kian. He shared a picture of his son as an Instagram story, a few hours before he committed suicide. Even his last Instagram post is a picture of himself with Kian.

I very well know the demographics of this forum, but there are number of 40+ people on this group. So opening this debate - it's worth discussing and deserves a serious debate, as it is not discussed in Indian society. You are automatically given the dreaded status of ""uncle"" or ""aunty"", and your status in society is fixed by some invisible norms. Popular culture, media or marketing teams conveniently ignore your tastes and likes/dislikes.

I would love to discuss this issue with my friends on WhatsApp, but all of them are too busy sucking Modi's dick. Also, given that WhatsApp is not anonymous and the fact that this issue might be too personal to discuss, most friends might not open up.

Yes, your body changes once you hit 40. But the worst part is the stagnation in career. I live in Canada, so the career stagnation is major is I was obviously forced into an engineering career, so I lost all interest in the job once I turned 40, negatively impacting my career. I pursued MBA part-time from a reputed Canadian B-school, but without spending time on networking, the degree didn't help. I now drag on in my career with no chance of promotion or career switching.

Also, being a gay guy doesn't help once you hit 40, as pool of partner availability decreases. Only guys that hit on you are young guys looking for a ""daddy"" - one in which I have no interest.

I was completely disappointed. It looks like our constitution gives right to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly only to citizens. In particular it says

>All citizens shall have the right—
(a) to freedom of speech and expression;
(b) to assemble peaceably and without arms;
(c) to form associations or unions;
(d) to move freely throughout the territory of India;
(e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory
of India

> Constitution of India, Part III, Article 19

After a bit of digging, I learnt that the supreme court has also held Article 19 as applicable only to citizens while affirming that other fundamental rights are applicable to non-citizens too.

>The Fundamental Rights contained in Article 19, which contains the right to ""Basic Freedoms"", namely, freedom of speech and expression; freedom to assemble peaceably and without arms; freedom to form associations or unions; freedom to move freely throughout the territory of India; freedom to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India and freedom to practise any profession, or to carry on any occupation, trade or business, are available only to ""citizens"" of the country. The word ""citizen"" in Article 19 has not been used in a sense different from that in which it has been used in Part II of the Constitution dealing with ""citizenship"". [See: State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. vs. The Commercial Tax Officer and Others, AIR 1963 SC 1811 = 1964 (4) SCR 99]. It has also been held in this case that the words ""all citizens"" have been deliberately used to keep out all ""non-citizens"" which would include ""aliens"". It was laid down in Hans Muller of Nurenburg vs. Superintendent Presidency Jail Calcutta, AIR 1955 SC 367 (374) = 1955 (1) SCR 1284, that this Article applies only to ""citizens"". In another decision in Anwar vs. State of J & K, AIR 1971 SC 337 = 1971 (1) SCR 637 = (1971) 3 SCC 104, it was held that non-citizen could not claim Fundamental Rights under Article

> In Naziranbai vs. State, AIR 1957 M.B. 1 and Lakshmi Prasad & Anr. vs. Shiv Pal & Others, AIR 1974 Allahabad 313, it was held that Article 19 does not apply to a ""foreigner"". The Calcutta High Court in Sk. Md. Soleman vs. State of West Bengal and Another, AIR 1965 Calcutta 312, held that Article 19 does not apply to a Commonwealth citizen.


Again pretty disappointing! I don't know if there were explicit rules prohibiting peaceful assembly and protest by non-citizens, but unlike in the US it looks like they are not fundamentally guaranteed these freedoms. It seems like a glaring hole in the constitution when we want to live in an international world. 

I'm not a lawyer so maybe someone here can shed more light on how this applies? For example can a non-citizen write political articles in a paper or a magazine?",1577477413.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,10

1569,"Indian mentality.This is something that I wanted to get off my chest. India got its independence in 1947 but even now indirectly we are under the rule of westerners.

Let me start with education

Our curriculum is such that , innovation and creativity is killed, we are trained and educated in such a way that we can work under the huge MNC's operated by westerners. Individuality is killed and people are corrupted by the sheep mentality. Higher education is a big joke in this country, those who pursue masters and post docs are those who couldn't land a job(most cases). We still have the slave mindset within us , we want to work for someone, doesn't matter if you like the job but we will work to get paid.The syllabus was designed by the british and we are still following it.

Moving on, we have our economy,

India and Pakistan are the cheapest countries to live in this world, not africa,not venezuela but India. What this essentially means is that if you go to any other country with the same wealth you possess in India, you will become [poorer .](https://poorer.No)  No wonder Americans use Indians for cheap labour. Even after being the cheapest country to live in , we have so many living below poverty line which speaks a lot about wealth distribution in our country. All those who come up with stats regarding GDP, please lookup GDP per person because that's what essentially matters.

We call ourselves a secular country, but ram mandir dispute constantly made headlines. Let me be honest, I dont care about who wins regarding this, but was this really a priority, can't this wait until we have progressed in other important areas?, our healthcare is in such bad condition, the state of the BPL people are pathetic but they want to construct this temple now anyways? Im not asking them to build hospitals in the place instead of the temple, that's foolishness and makes no sense, why can't they spend on healthcare and education first and afterwards think about this temple.

The defense budget is 3.18 lakh crore ,great our army is powerful and is the second largest but what the government fails to realize is that the biggest war is happening inside India. We spend so much preparing for war with other countries that we fail to fight our internal problems. Why can't the budget for healthcare and education be increased by reducing the budget for defense. Now some might argue that countries like USA too spend large o defense but the difference is that they are already developed, they don't have much problems from within whereas we are still a third world country.

All those media hype surrounding how India is a rising superpower is complete bogus, they want us to believe we are making progress so that can make good use of our pathetic situation. The real rising superpower is china, just look at their technological advancements.  

Moving on, we have sports 

The most popular sport in India is cricket. Now let me remind you that cricket was introduced by the british to us and we still play the game widely while they have moved on other sports. cricket is the number one sport only in 2 countries , India and pakistan both which were ruled by british. We are indirectly still slaves, we play the same sport they gave us even after 100 years. 

Having a population of about 1.4billion, our representation in olympics wont even equal countries which have population less than 10 million. Thats how pathetic is the condition of sports in India.

People just dont care, dont watch and don't play other sports, we simply aren't told to do so and so we refrain from playing others, only if this mentality changes will we progress in other sports, we can't just blame the government for not funding, if people aren't watching how will they fund. 

Moving on, we have women safety

Women safety is a big joke in India, Indian culture teaches us to respect women but why is the situation so pathetic.

Clearly this is because of lack of education and lack of sex education.

We wrote kamasutra, but now talking about sex is taboo. Indian schools treat sex as a foreign topic and most schools just outright skips this topic. When you say sex is taboo, it increases the curiosity in the mind of people, people crave most what they don't get/understand and like adding oil to fire we have all bollywood movies objectifying women which corrupts the weak minded and thus they give in to their sexual feelings.  

Sex education is important to understand and control one's feelings. 

I created a Fake facebook id, with a woman's picture as the profile picture and I got 879 friend requests within a day, most of them being indians, and I got 100 pm's asking me for nude pics. This level of desperation will ultimately lead to them becoming rapists and [molesters. No](https://molesters.No)   wonder women dislike Indian men.

And finally I want to end with bollywood

Most of the actors are light skinned and have features similar to europeans.Almost half of the actresses are NRI who eith er lived in england or USA.

This clearly shows that we still subconsciously are being slaves, we consider light skinned more superior, we feel they deserve more respect and this mentality should be changed if we really want progress in our society.",1577458127.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,2

Long story short, I asked oif I can crack JEE Mains in 3-4 months or not. Spoiler Alert: NO. 


I am sorry I do not mean to make reddit quora but I needed a place to get some things which have been dwelling on my mind out, place where certain type of people can hear me without judging me and this subreddit seemed like the best place to do so. 
I have tried, given it my best but with the time left for the April attempt but it is practically impossible to do so.
I am terrible at maths and need to give an improvement exam as well. 

Everything seems far fetched dream right now, feeling like loosing hope, letting everyone I know, letting my friends and family down. Burden of expectation, it's immense. It's really disheartening that I was so motivated in the beginning I studied like hell and the time I had in june was not a lot but seemed enough to be able to turn my life around. I was never academically great but I am proud that I had curiosity which gave me a dream of becoming an engineer. Might seem like self appreciation but I just am proud of it. As a kid I had opened up my newly arrived PS2 to see how it works and took me a ton of Wikipedia reading to figure it out modded it myself in 4th class, including soldering all modchip wires. I'll never get over the tragedy that struck me. I can't keep wasting my parents' money. 

However I do not plan on giving up. I know I can't crack JEE but I can crack UPSEE state level exam and I'll work my way up from there. Hopefully I can do that. 

Thank you for reading. I don't know if it's a good post or a bad one but I'm just depressed and stressed beyond what I thought I can handle at the moment.",1577480572.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,4,5

1636,"Opinion: Bhakts are actually the biggest anti-nationals themselves.Bhakts and hardcore nationalists love to throw around words such as traitor or anti-national nonchalantly without really understanding the deeper meaning behind them. Often times they are the evil that they accuse others to be. Let's examine some instances of where this is relevant. 

&#x200B;

**Cheering for CAA and NRC:** You're not deshbhakt if you do not even believe in the idea of a secular India that was envisioned by our founding fathers. You support a law that strips India of its secularism and literally paves the way for concentration camps in our country! 

  
**Supporting police beating innocent protesters:** You're not a deshbhakt if you cheer and rejoice with the idea of khakhi wearing goons beating the living hell out of innocent protesters for practicing their fundamental rights to dissent and oppose any government regulations or laws. If you are okay with ""police"" framing innocent people by destroying public property and beating students silently studying in their university library then you are not a deshbhakt; you're a traitor! 

&#x200B;

**Fantasizing about Hindu rashtra:** You're not a deshbhakt if you fantasize about India becoming a religious ethno-state where the minority is stomped and oppressed with impunity. You're no different from the deranged talbanis and other fundamentalist Muslims who believe in racial and religious purity. On top of that most countries that have defined themselves by their religion are actually a living hell for their citizenry. 

  
**Worshiping leader(s) without questioning them:** You're not a deshbhakt if you blindly support two political leaders and have a knee jerk reaction when anybody questions them. Questioning elected political leaders is the duty of every citizen and if you an aversion to it then you're suffering from tendencies reflective of fascism and communal hatred. 

  
**Spreading hatred on social media:** You're not a deshbhakt if you willingly spread lies and create mistrust among the members of your own community by posting and sharing inflammatory posts based on total lies and bogus facts. When you sow the seeds of violence like that between our own countrymen, then you're a traitor; certainly not a deshbhakt! 

  
**Claiming to recognize bad people by the clothes they're wearing:** This is pretty evident. You're not a deshbhakt if you claim that you have the magical and supernatural abilities to spot anti-nationals just by the type of clothes they're wearing. You're engaging in profiling of people and hating them for something that is in many cases out of their control, which renders you as a traitor. 

**Shoving your patriotism down other people's throat:** Last but not the least, you're definitely not a deshbhakt if you believe in encroaching on the freedoms of others and making them believe in your own ideology by force. Whether it is shouting and harassing people who do not stand up for the national anthem in a cinema or threatening others who don't subscribe to the same ideas that you so dearly love.",1577474897.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,25,126

1758,"32 Inch TV Selection help... Sanyo Kaizen Android vs Onida Fire TVHi, this is Sibe, from Chennai. I'm planning to buy a tv preferably 32inch, as I'm on a restricted budget (\~ Rs 15,000). 40 or  43 inches will set me back by another Rs.10,000 Now, there are tons of budget options these days and I'm torn between selecting the best among them. So far, I've narrowed down to two tv's (Trying to avoid Mi, Vu or TCL brands as I'm hearing mixed reviews about them regarging the picture quality, hardware and software performance). One is the Sanyo Kaizen 32inch TV and the other is the newly launched Onida 32 inch Fire TV Edition.   Both are available on Amazon for a similar price (The firetv after the cashback). Now, from the reviews I've seen so far, the Sanyo tv is a panasonic sub brand, which is good. Meaning quality hardware (I believe, since its from panasonic). Although, there are lot of after sales compliants on Amazon for bad service support.  The ones that are working, they say they are the best in this segment. But the ones that aren't, well, the users are furious about it. The software here is Android, which  is very similar to most tv's available in the market and well established too. 

&#x200B;

Now, the other one is the Onida fire TV edition, an Indian brand which is good. But how does it compare with Sanyo in terms of hardware quality? (Considering its market price is 2000 more, excluding this launch cashback offer. I'm sure the price will be increased from 1st of Jan). And the software is FireOS from Amazon. And I've heard very good things about it(Personally, I havent userd neither Android tvs nor Fire TV's before. So, both would be new experience  for me) Since this TV is new in the market, there arent much reviews about it yet. 

Or, one more option is to get a good ""STANDARD TV"" at around 15K budget and then go for a streaming device like FireStick  sometime later. If so, is there any particular model you 

So, as an expert in these matters, can you help me choosing the right one between the two? or three considering the standard TV option too? 

One additional question: If we go for the Fire tv from Onida, can we sideload android apps like we do with Android tv's?? (I know FireOS runs on Android, but still I have this doubt)

Thank you for your patience to read this far. And thanks in advance if your answer to this question helps me to get out of my dilemma.

Happy new year 2020!!! Cheers !!!

We criticize Smriti's arrogance, her education qualification. We started rating Nirmala Sitharaman's performance within few months though I don't think no other finance minister was in such a tough situation as she is.

As far as I remember, Mr. Jaitley was citicized far less when he justified Demonitization and GST implementation. Similarly, we hardly see any memes on *Ramesh Pokhriyal* where as Smriti was always the focus of jokes and memes when she was in HRD.

Are liberals being misogynistic too, even in their criticism of Cabinet ministers?

1821,"AMA Announcement: Aatish Taseer, writer, journalist. December 27th, 9:30 PM IST (i.e. today!)Hello r/India,

Most of you are probably already familiar with Aatish and his writing. We invited him for an AMA and he agreed to do it. Aatish will be with us to answer questions and share his opinions on politics, the ongoing citizenship protests in India among other things. 

In case you are not familiar with his work please find some details below:

> Taseer was born in London to politician and businessman Salman Taseer (who was born in British India to a British mother and Indian father, the latter became Pakistani at partition) and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh. His parents never married, he was raised by his mother and had no contact with his father until he was aged 21. He was raised in New Delhi, before attending Kodaikanal International School, a residential school in Kodaikanal.  Taseer later studied at Amherst College  in Massachusetts, earning dual Bachelor of Arts degrees in French and Political Science in 2001.  In his first book Stranger to History (2009), which received many reviews in India, he wrote about his estrangement from his father who was a governor of the Punjab province in Pakistan

> Aatish Taseer became a contributing opinion writer for The International New York Times in the fall of 2015.
> He is the author, most recently, of “The Way Things Were,” which The Los Angeles Review of Books described as “the best Indian novel of the last decade.”
> His other books are “Stranger to History: A Son’s Journey Through Islamic Lands,” a Costa-shortlisted first novel, “The Temple-Goers,” and the highly acclaimed “Noon.” He has written for The Wall Street Journal, The Financial Times and The Sunday Times, London, among other publications.

> On 8 November 2019, Taseer's Overseas Citizenship of India was revoked by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs claiming he attempted to ""conceal information that his father was of Pakistani origin"". Taseer has said this is untrue, he never concealed the identity of his father with whom he had no contact and his mother was always he only legal guardian as a minor. Taseer alleged that the ministry didn't give him enough time and that it was an act of reprisal. In his May 2019 cover article for Time magazine, published during the Indian election entitled ""India’s divider in chief"" he was highly critical of the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi. He told The Guardian that his citizenship issue had not caused him any problems before the Time article was published. The Home ministry rejected the claim that the Time article had any connection to the rejection of Taseer's citizenship.

> Taseer's first book Stranger to History: A Son's Journey Through Islamic Lands (2009), His part memoir-part travelogue, has been translated into more than 14 languages and hailed as a ""must-read"" for anyone attempting to understand the Muslim world. Taseer's well received translation of Saadat Hasan Manto's short stories from the original Urdu, Manto: Selected Stories, was published in 2008.

The AMA is scheduled for 27th December, 9:30 PM IST. 

Please be there!

Which will be better for me?Thanks for reading my post. r/india is very busy protesting against the CAA+NRC. And you have found time for reading this. Thanks for that.

I am a student from Kolkata. My end goal is to work as an ML engineer at a European country or the US.

Should I sit for WBJEE which has no age bar, after I pass out the next year? Or should I sit for NIMCAT, WB-JECA etc after the same?

Which will help me to get further towards my goal? An MCA or a BTech?

NIMCAT seems like a piece of cake compared to WBJEE. That means I have to take a year off to preapare for WBJEE, and BTech courses are 4 year long. So it will take me 5 years to be employable. But MCA will take me only three.

Father is retiring in 2020. But if BTech is important enough, I think I can manage 5 years.

But I have no knowledge about these things. Genuinely seeking advice from you. Don't know anyone who has done MCA from a reputed institute.

I also want to be employable after I get my degree. If I can't start with ML, I want to be able to start with development, if not abroad, in India.

But my endgoal remains the same.

I have excellent career records. And I am confident that I can crack WBJEE, NIMCAT and other exams. But to get to a reputed institute through WBJEE, I need a 2-digit rank. I can get that, but how can I guaranty that?

Can I please get genuine advice?",1577420634.0,,,dark,10,9

This is the biggest police crackdown in Uttar Pradesh since the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots when 1,480 people were arrested in 567 cases. The riots had claimed 63 lives and displaced an estimated 50,000 people. Among the people arrested in Lucknow are social activist and Congress worker Sadaf Jafar, retired IPS officer S R Darapuri (75), lawyer Mohammad Shueb (76), theatre artist Deepak Kabir, Robin Verma and Pawan Rao Ambedkar. Darapuri, Shueb and Robin are members of the Rihai Manch while Pawan is a social activist. Shueb was initially under house arrest but he was picked up after the December 19 violence and arrested for allegedly instigating people to protest.

Seems like something for the history books.  

But I'm curious to learn about your ground-level reality and what you think the future holds.  It feels like India is at a pivotal point and different voices are clamoring to be heard.  I hope that you and other countries as well (Hong Kong, etc) can keep up the good fight for democratic freedom.

Even though my mom makes her own money, my dad has full control over it, he yells at both of them multiple times during the day and gets angry if they do anything without his permission. It's pretty nuts but I also think that both my father and my grandfather grew up in a patriarchal family which might be why he wants so much control.

1950,"OPINION: How to be objective with political arguments in the era of internet?We're unaware of this but internet has more influence on shaping a human being's personality than anything else. All our opinions, All of our data, All of our knowledge in one place being accessed by simply typing into a search engine. Just a decade back we were being conditioned by our immediate social circles, The concept of nuclear families is universally accepted because it's very effective, It's the classic rule of one Jedi master for one padawan.  A 2-parent household is more likely to have a higher consistency to raise their children by reaching an agreement on discipline and modelling appropriate behaviour as opposed to a community at large. But today Internet has clearly filled the gaps in between.

Internet has become so powerful that it is shaping world history as we speak. Who would've thought an encyclopaedia of all human knowledge would actually make us dumber. This brings us to the most important topic  I want to talk about, Politics. There have been many governments toppled over before, many fascist regimes brought to the ground before the internet was just a bunch of Orkut testimonials. But now we have a tool, A tool to organise, educate, mobilise and agitate on a larger scale but unfortunately this tool doesn't come with an instruction manual. The state knows how to use this against us because well it is powerful and has the resources to form detailed strategies. It was comparatively easier to open a political debate and convince someone before the Internet than it is now. Since the state can control and change what you see, they get to control narrative and their supporters always lap it up.

I've worked a corporate job for 7 years now and what I learnt from managing my team is singling out a person doesn't help anyone's cause. The only way to get someone on your side is to address the issue at large. It helps you and the person on the other side of table be more objective. The voice of dissent should be a voice of reason not a voice of hate. Otherwise we just get perceived as online Lynch mobs. 

I  just saw a lot of people making memes on the expensive sunglasses worn by our PM and am guilty myself of participating in it too. Then I realised whatever helps them deflect from the narrative is our defeat. Any distraction from the real cause is counter productive. Any hate directed towards the person instead of their work is very easy to convert into oh they just hate him. That gives the state a lot of space to promote fake achievements and window dressed figures.

Any sort of dissent which directs abuse at a single person especially a fascist makes them stronger. 

""Chowkidhar chor hain"" turned into ""Main bhi chowkidhar"" and changed the narrative big time for the LS elections. The ability of narcissists to victimise themselves is unparalleled and their blind supporters will lap it up, It beats our purpose. 

What fascists hate the most is when you show them they’re wrong. Don’t address the person, address the issue. Criticise the polices, the bad governance, criticise their work.  I know this sounds preachy and I’m sorry but this approach has helped me big time while opening discussions with loyal RW people and convincing them.",1577434535.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,21

1953,"India is now a laughing stock for the world. View from SE Asia.I am an Indian residing in south-east asia.   
India used to be considered a rising star, but recently it is a laughing stock. People talk of India in the same language as Nigeria or Sudan. As a state where half the people can't get food to eat and the government is busy planning an ethnic genocide. As a place where people think sex is taboo but still have 3-4 babies (mostly in UP etc). 

  
Laborers from UP, Haryana, and Bihar are just everywhere here- restaurants, gas stations etc. Most are just illegal immigrants who migrated for less than Rs. 20,000 a month when locals charge double that. 

Ironically, visits by BJP ministers here attract the cheering of typical NRIs who are here because they won't get good jobs in India. 

Talk to anyone from Thailand, Indonesia or Vietnam. No one respects our country now. Respect comes out of economic might here. We are inching towards a failed state. It doesn't matter if India was great 5000 years ago. We have the most polluted cities, less than 20% piped water, half the population shits in the open (because of no water or sanitation) and more than 10 million being added to the unemployed list every year. 

You may think that India is great at technology, but believe me, Vietnam and Philippines are coming up faster than we can imagine. The top 0.1% educated in foreign universities and premier Indian colleges are doing well in India and creating value- but beyond that the tech story is not good.

https://preview.redd.it/ns6e85qev4741.png?width=1215&format=png&auto=webp&s=ffa4797d058493519eb7548c604b9b22e260b876

## Tl;dr

Earlier this month, we updated you on a  submission we made to the TRAI on Cloud Services where it put out a  consultation paper that suggested the regulation of cloud service  providers through the creation of overseeing industry bodies. We just  submitted our counter comments on the paper and thankfully a lot of  other groups agree with our stance that this sector does not need more  regulation!

## It's raining, no it's pouring, over-regulation

If  you were a little busy this beginning holiday season and missed our  post how the TRAI intends to regulate cloud service provider, you can  read all about it in our [previous post here](https://internetfreedom.in/we-must-prevent-cloud-cartel/).  Coming back to TRAI’s worrying decision; as part of our counter  comments, as always we created a tabular chart of vital submissions made  by each group that responded to the consultation paper and of-course  provided further comments to each of them.

This 40-something  document is definitely a task to go through but while we urge you to  read up on the submissions (some of them are really interesting), we’ve  got you covered on the most important snippets - yes, it is a breakdown  of who is for the paper’s main suggestion (of regulating cloud service  providers) and who is against.

**In favour**

1. *Cloud Computing Innovation Council of India*The  CCICI has broadly shown support toward the paper, however, it disagrees  on a few nitty-gritties such as the type of category based on which a  Cloud Service Provider (CSP) should be registered.
2. *Consumer Care Society and Consumer Protection Association*Both  these consumer based bodies have indicated that CSPs be regulated with  specific suggestions in response to the paper’s questions on how do so  as well. Not keeping in mind the consumers too much eh?
3. *PayMate, Reliance Jio, Tata Teleservices*Unsurprisingly,  Reliance and Tata (the telecom based groups) have advocated for the  regulation of CSPs and although they disagree on the need for the  creation of single or multiple bodies, they have both maintained that it  important to avoid confusion and conflicting agendas. PayMate on the  other hand has demonstrated partial support to the extent that it has  emphasised on only the need for self-regulation by the industry.

**Against**

*Out of the 21 submission made, a majority has been against the idea of regulation of CSPs.*  This section’s format is slightly different, as a large portion of the  groups agree on the same points, we’ve put forth some of the important  arguments made against the paper’s intentions.

First, here are the  list of groups that have shown disapproval; Asia Cloud Computing  Association, Asia Internet Coalition, Amazon Web Services, Broadband  Indian Forum, BSA, Cellular Operation Association of India, IAMAI,  Information Technology Industry Council, Internet Service Providers  Association of India, NASSCOM, Telecom User Group, India, US India  Business Council, VMware Software India and ofcourse, yours truly.

There  has been unanimous agreement that the CSPs are governed by MEITY; this  reasoning has been supported by the point that MEITY is tasked with  developing policies for information technology and the Internet under  the Allocation of Business Rules. We broadly echo and endorse these  concerns.

You can read our counter comments as well as our initial submission below.

2040,"Shaheed Bhagat Singh's emotional letter to Shaheed Sukhdev [April 5 1929]Dear Brother,

By the time you receive this letter, I will be gone, going to a far off destination. Let me assure that I am prepared for the voyage in spite of all the sweet memory and in spite of all the charms of my life here. Up to this day one thing pinched in my heart and it was this that my brother, my own brother, misunderstood and accused me of a very serious charge — the charge of weakness. Today I am quite satisfied, today more than ever do I feel that was nothing, but a misunderstanding, a wrong calculation. My over frankness was interpreted as my talkativeness and my confession as to my weakness. And now I feel it was a misunderstanding and  only is understanding. I am not weak, not weaker than anyone amongst us, brother. With a clear heart I go, will you clear too? It will be very kind of you. But note that you are to take no hasty step, soberly and calmly you are to carry on the work. Don't try to take the chance at the very outset. You have some duty towards the public, and that you can fulfill by continuing this work. As a suggestion, I would say that  M.R. Shastri appeals to me more than ever. Try to bring him in the arena, provided he himself may be willing, clearly knowing the dark future. Let him mix with men and study their psychology. If he will work in the right spirit, he will be the better judge. Arrange as you may deem fit. Now, brother, let us be happy.

By the way, I am saying that I cannot help arguing once again my case in the matter under discussion. Again do I emphasize that I am full of ambition and hope and of full charm of life. But I can renounce all at the time of need, and that is the real sacrifice. These things can never be a hindrance in the way of man, provided he be a man. You will have practical proof in the near future. While discussing anybody's character you asked me one thing, whether love ever proved helpful to any man. Yes, I answer that question today. To Mazzini it was. You must have read that after the utter failure and crushing defeat of his first rising he could no bear the misery and haunting ideas of his dead comrades. He would have gone mad or committed suicide but for one letter of a girl he loved. He would as strong as anyone, nay stronger than all. As regards the moral status of love I may say that it in itself is nothing BUT PASSION, not an animal passion but a human one and very sweet too. Love in itself can never be an animal passion. Love always elevates the character of a man. It never lowers him, provided love be love. You can't call these girls — mad people, as we generally see in  films — lovers. They always play in the hands of animals passions. The  true love cannot be created. It comes of its own accord, nobody can say  when. It is but natural. And I may tell you that a young man and a young girl can love each other, and with the aid of their love, they can overcome the passions themselves and can maintain their purity. I may clear one thing here; when I said that love has a human weakness, I did not say it for an ordinary human being at this stage, where the people generally are. But that is the most idealistic stage when a man would overcome all these sentiments, the love, the hatred, and so on. When man will  take reason as the sole basis of his activity. But at present it is not bad, rather good and useful to man. And moreover while rebuking the love. I rebuked the love of one individual for one, and that too in an idealistic stage. And even then, man must have the strongest feelings of  love which he may not confine to one individual and may make it universal. Now I think I have cleared my position. One thing I may tell you to mark; we in spite of all radical ideas that we cherish, have not been able to do away with the over idealistic Arya Samajist conception of morality. We may talk glibly about all the radical things that can possibly be conceived, but in practical life, we begin to tremble at the very outset. This I will request you do away with. And may I, Without fear at all the misapprehension in my mind, request you do kindly lower the standard of your over-idealism a bit, not to be harsh to those who will live behind and will be the victims of the disease as myself? Don't rebuke them and thus add to their woes and miseries. They need your sympathy. May I repeat that you, without bearing any sort of grudge against any particular individual, will sympathize with those who needed the most? But you cannot realize these things unless and until you yourself fall a victim to this. But, why I am writing all this? I wanted to be frank. I have cleared my heart.

Wish you all success and a happy life.

Yours,B. S

I struggle with eliminating plastic bags completely from my life. I intend to keep the usage as low as possible but often see myself failing. Two instances where I would like tips from the people here:

**Disposing wet kitchen waste**\- This one is really difficult to substitute with anything. I have a plastic dustbin which I line with a plastic bag whose mouths can be tied (they are easily available everywhere now - general shops, Amazon, BigBasket, etc). The convenience of this system is hard to beat. When the garbage man comes, I just lift the liner, tie the mouth and my work is done! BigBasket has these oxy biodegradable something bags but I think using them makes hardly any difference. What do I do? What less harmful technique do you use for disposing organic waste?

**Plastic bags from grocery shopping** \- I now have my own arsenal of plastic bags of all shapes and sizes! A plastic bag of plastic bags, smh. I try to reuse them as much as I can but the difference isn't stark - from single use, they just become double use plastic. Some are totally useless such as the packets are really small when I buy 50 gms or 100 gms of something.

2266,"Weird situation with an Amazon order - got both refund & product. What to do?Hey everyone!
&#x200B;

I placed an order of 4 items with Amazon. They were supposed to arrive in 2 different shipments - 2 in one, other 2 in one. I myself received the first shipment since I was home, however the 2nd was received by the security guard in my building.
&#x200B;

Now, I forgot to collect the shipment from the guard the day it was delivered (Monday morning). When I went the next day(Tuesday evening), the guard said that the same delivery guy had come, took items from him, again knocked on my door, and since I was unavailable, took the items back with him. He asked me to contact the customer care.
&#x200B;

I, although puzzled (why would the delivery boy bother coming again to see if I took it from the guard and take the item back with him, when Amazon clearly shows ""Delivered Monday""), contacted Amazon care on Wednesday and the customer care lady put a refund request for this shipment. I don't know why, but at her end it was showing ""Item not received by customer."" So she was quick to issue a refund.
&#x200B;

About an hour after this phone call, the same guard came to give me the 2 items in the shipment. Now, **I have both the refund amount in my bank account and the 2 items with me**. I haven't opened them yet though.
&#x200B;

What do I do? Has anyone been in this situation before? Amazon cannot extract money from my account now, and I intend to keep the items. How do I pay them?
&#x200B;

Do I put a return request only this time without any refund, let someone come to collect them and then place a fresh order?

2300,"For history buffs: a brief history of ancient Sri Lanka interactions with IndiaHistory buff lurker here.

The mahavamsa is an ancient Sinhalese chronicle detailing events of Sri Lanka which also gives some insights into what was happening in Southern India at the time. I am interested in the history of Buddhism in South Asia, particularly in South India (which used to have a considerable Buddhist presence at one point) and came across this (http://countrystudies.us/sri-lanka/6.htm).

> Because the Mahavamsa is essentially a chronicle of the early Sinhalese-Buddhist royalty on the island, it does not provide information on the island's early ethnic distributions. There is, for instance, only scant evidence as to when the first Tamil settlements were established. Tamil literary sources, however, speak of active trading centers in southern India as early as the third century B.C. and it is probable that these centers had at least some contact with settlements in northern Sri Lanka. There is some debate among historians as to whether settlement by Indo-Aryan speakers preceded settlement by Dravidian-speaking Tamils, but there is no dispute over the fact that Sri Lanka, from its earliest recorded history, was a multiethnic society. Evidence suggests that during the early centuries of Sri Lankan history there was considerable harmony between the Sinhalese and Tamils.

> The peace and stability of the island were first significantly affected around 237 B.C. when two adventurers from southern India, Sena and Guttika, usurped the Sinhalese throne at Anuradhapura. Their combined twenty-two-year rule marked the first time Sri Lanka was ruled by Tamils. The two were subsequently murdered, and the Sinhalese royal dynasty was restored. In 145 B.C., a Tamil general named Elara, of the Chola dynasty (which ruled much of India from the ninth to twelfth centuries A.D.), took over the throne at Anuradhapura and ruled for forty-four years. A Sinhalese king, Dutthagamani (or Duttugemunu), waged a fifteen-year campaign against the Tamil monarch and finally deposed him.

> Dutthagamani is the outstanding hero of the Mahavamsa, and his war against Elara is sometimes depicted in contemporary accounts as a major racial confrontation between Tamils and Sinhalese. A less biased and more factual interpretation, according to Sri Lankan historian K.M. de Silva, must take into consideration the large reserve of support Elara had among the Sinhalese. Furthermore, another Sri Lankan historian, Sinnappah Arasaratnam, argues that the war was a dynastic struggle that was purely political in nature. As a result of Dutthagamani's victory, Anuradhapura became the locus of power on the island. Arasaratnam suggests the conflict recorded in the Mahavamsa marked the beginning of Sinhalese nationalism and that Dutthagamani's victory is commonly interpreted as a confirmation that the island was a preserve for the Sinhalese and Buddhism. The historian maintains that the story is still capable of stirring the religio-communal passions of the Sinhalese.

> The Tamil threat to the Sinhalese Buddhist kingdoms had become very real in the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. Three Hindu empires in southern India--the Pandya, Pallava, and Chola-- were becoming more assertive. The Sinhalese perception of this threat intensified because in India, Buddhism--vulnerable to pressure and absorption by Hinduism--had already receded. Tamil ethnic and religious consciousness also matured during this period. In terms of culture, language, and religion, the Tamils had identified themselves as Dravidian, Tamil, and Hindu, respectively.

> Another Sinhalese king praised in the Mahavamsa is Dhatusena (459-77), who, in the fifth century A.D., liberated Anuradhapura from a quarter- century of Pandyan rule. The king was also honored as a generous patron of Buddhism and as a builder of water storage tanks. Dhatusena was killed by his son, Kasyapa (477-95), who is regarded as a great villain in Sri Lankan history. In fear of retribution from his exiled brother, the parricide moved the capital from Anuradhapura to Sigiriya, a fortress and palace perched on a monolithic rock 180 meters high. Although the capital was returned to Anuradhapura after Kasyapa was dethroned, Sigiriya is an architectural and engineering fete displayed in an inaccessible redoubt. The rock fortress eventually fell to Kasyapa's brother, who received help from an army of Indian mercenaries.

> In the seventh century A.D., Tamil influence became firmly embedded in the island's culture when Sinhalese Prince Manavamma seized the throne with Pallava assistance. The dynasty that Manavamma established was heavily indebted to Pallava patronage and continued for almost three centuries. During this time, Pallava influence extended to architecture and sculpture, both of which bear noticeable Hindu motifs.

> By the middle of the ninth century, the Pandyans had risen to a position of ascendancy in southern India, invaded northern Sri Lanka, and sacked Anuradhapura. The Pandyans demanded an indemnity as a price for their withdrawal. Shortly after the Pandyan departure, however, the Sinhalese invaded Pandya in support of a rival prince, and the Indian city of Madurai was sacked in the process.

> In the tenth century, the Sinhalese again sent an invading army to India, this time to aid the Pandyan king against the Cholas. The Pandyan king was defeated and fled to Sri Lanka, carrying with him the royal insignia. The Chola, initially under Rajaraja the Great (A.D 985-1018), were impatient to recapture the royal insignia; they sacked Anuradhapura in A.D. 993 and annexed Rajarata--the heartland of the Sinhalese kingdom--to the Chola Empire. King Mahinda V, the last of the Sinhalese monarchs to rule from Anuradhapura, fled to Rohana, where he reigned until 1017, when the Chola took him prisoner. He subsequently died in India in 1029.

> Under the rule of Rajaraja's son, Rajendra (1018-35), the Chola Empire grew stronger, to the extent that it posed a threat to states as far away as the empire of Sri Vijaya in modern Malaysia and Sumatra in Indonesia. For seventy-five years, Sri Lanka was ruled directly as a Chola province. During this period, Hinduism flourished, and Buddhism received a serious setback. After the destruction of Anuradhapura, the Chola set up their capital farther to the southeast, at Polonnaruwa, a strategically defensible location near the Mahaweli Ganga, a river that offered good protection against potential invaders from the southern Sinhalese kingdom of Ruhunu. When the Sinhalese kings regained their dominance, they chose not to reestablish themselves at Anuradhapura because Polonnaruwa offered better geographical security from any future invasions from southern India. The area surrounding the new capital already had a well- developed irrigation system and a number of water storage tanks in the vicinity, including the great Minneriya Tank and its feeder canals built by King Mahasena (A.D. 274-301), the last of the Sinhalese monarchs mentioned in the Mahavamsa.

> King Vijayabahu I drove the Chola out of Sri Lanka in A.D. 1070. Considered by many as the author of Sinhalese freedom, the king recaptured Anuradhapura but ruled from Polonnaruwa, slightly less than 100 kilometers to the southeast. During his forty-year reign, Vijayabahu I (A.D. 1070-1110) concentrated on rebuilding the Buddhist temples and monasteries that had been neglected during Chola rule. He left no clearly designated successor to his throne, and a period of instability and civil war followed his rule until the rise of King Parakramabahu I, known as the Great (A.D. 1153-86).

> Parakramabahu is the greatest hero of the Culavamsa, and under his patronage, the city of Polonnaruwa grew to rival Anuradhapura in architectural diversity and as a repository of Buddhist art. Parakramabahu was a great patron of Buddhism and a reformer as well. He reorganized the sangha (community of monks) and healed a longstanding schism between Mahavihara--the Theravada Buddhist monastery--and Abhayagiri--the Mahayana Buddhist monastery. Parakramabahu's reign coincided with the last great period of Sinhalese hydraulic engineering; many remarkable irrigation works were constructed during his rule, including his crowning achievement, the massive Parakrama Samudra (Sea of Parakrama or Parakrama Tank). Polonnaruwa became one of the magnificent capitals of the ancient world, and nineteenth-century British historian Sir Emerson Tenant even estimated that during Parakramabahu's rule, the population of Polonnaruwa reached 3 million--a figure, however, that is considered to be too high by twentieth-century historians.

> Parakramabahu's reign was not only a time of Buddhist renaissance but also a period of religious expansionism abroad. Parakramabahu was powerful enough to send a punitive mission against the Burmese for their mistreatment of a Sri Lankan mission in 1164. The Sinhalese monarch also meddled extensively in Indian politics and invaded southern India in several unsuccessful expeditions to aid a Pandyan claimant to the throne.

> Although a revered figure in Sinhalese annals, Parakramabahu is believed to have greatly strained the royal treasury and contributed to the fall of the Sinhalese kingdom. The post- Parakramabahu history of Polonnaruwa describes the destruction of the city twenty-nine years after his death and fifteen rulers later.

> For the decade following Parakramabahu's death, however, a period of peace and stability ensued during the reign of King Nissankamalla (A.D. 1187-97). During Nissankamalla's rule, the Brahmanic legal system came to regulate the Sinhalese caste system. Henceforth, the highest caste stratum became identified with the cultivator caste, and land ownership conferred high status. Occupational caste became hereditary and regulated dietary and marriage codes. At the bottom of the caste strata was the Chandala, who corresponded roughly to the Indian untouchable. It was during this brief period that it became mandatory for the Sinhalese king to be a Buddhist.

Some salient points of interest on Sri Lanka and the Sinhalese emerging from this history:

- Sinhalese consciousness is characterized by a view that since ancient times, they have been the ones to protect Buddhism in South Asia from the Hindus (of South India).

- Ancient Sinhalese kings had both rivalries and friendships with various rulers and dynasties like the Cholas, Pandyans, Pallavas.

Perhaps the most important point is the possibility that:

 - The repeated destruction of Buddhist monuments and monasteries in the North of Sri Lanka, particularly by Cholas (which were later restored by Sinhalese kings and some you can still see today) has set the backdrop for the current nationalistic sentiments of the Sinhalese who see the Tamils as the descendants of the enemy who may wipe out Buddhism if given the chance, just as in North India the hindutva elements see Indian Muslims as descendents of the Mughal and Delhi Sultanate plunderers ready to subjugate Hindus if given the chance.",1577351305.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,0,22

First about me

I'm a Master's in economics from a tier 2 college in Kerala with a 7.7 CGPA. I've done an internship at CPPR Kochi, on India Australia bilateral trade. I've A2 proficiency in French in CEFR scale for languages. 

I'd like to do a meaningful internship abroad. I'm aware of opportunities that websites like workaway and helpx offer, but that doesn't add any value to your CV. 

Then there is the option of organisations like AIESEC, FSL, World Endeavors. However they cost a fortune and are paid internships (The intern should pay the company ). 

I don't mind doing an internship and not being remunerated. However, I feel it's unfair to pay them a fortune to do work for them. 

However, I'm willing to pay an amount that can be justified. For example 30k - 80k for an internship.

 NDTV is unbiased as we know already. But i noticed that channels like ABP and especially Aaj Tak have started asking some real questions. ABP can be a little right leaning at times.

AajTak's 'agenda AajTak' also showed some tough questions fired at BJP and Left alike. Though they were tackled and redirected the party leaders. Today, they even played clips of Shah and Modi's conflicting statements regarding NRC and detention center. And raised a question as to who's lying.

The main intention of this has been (I hope) to extract and send back illegal immigrants from neighboring countries, namely Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

Before entering the CAA jargon, lets discuss immigration in the first place.

1. If there are illegals in our country what would we do?  

Ans :: Naturally, we would send them back (assuming you have patriotism and not too woke.)

2. But if they are staying here from a long time then? What about their families?  

Ans :: Hmm... Now is the moral dilemma. Alright, lets choose a minimum number of years (say 6 years). Anyone who are here fewer than that will be sent back.

So far so good. In fact, more than fair in my opinion. (I would have preferred at least 15 years)

Now comes the issue that is causing all the chaos. Muslims.

>"".....Provided that any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and who has been exempted by the Central Government....shall not be treated as illegal migrant.....""

Basically, you are a citizen if you have been staying for more than 6 years unless you are a Muslim. (It was such a sly way to put it by the way.)

But I have been struggling to understand why is that? Surely this has something more to do other than just agenda? How can it be accepted in the parliament otherwise?

Honestly, I am not sure and curious to have your input. I am not trying to cause another online war so comment only if you can add something meaningful.

Here are my thoughts :

India has been [struggling with terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_India) from its inception as a democracy. [Pakistan sponsored terrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism) is well known and sometimes even involved Indian Muslims who are either captured or brainwashed by terrorists. It seems natural to be extra cautious of illegal Muslims in India. If this was the intention of excluding them in the amendment, I wish it would have been more clear. Instead of bringing religion at all, how about :

>"".....Provided that any person who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014 and has not been involved in any suspicious activity after a thorough investigation....shall not be treated as illegal migrant.....""

I mean, who is to say Pakistan does not send terrorists under Hindu disguise? The people who made this amendment should have been a little more thoughtful.",1577291663.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,15,11

I recently joined telegram and surprised to find some good telegram groups. All of them regularly updating. I even joined almost 10 online deals groups. I know that there are a lot of groups on Facebook, Whatsapp and even on telegram, which is regularly posting awesome deals. But installing telegram helps me to download free movies too. So I stick.

I have joined some of these deals groups on Telegram sharing awesome deals, I saved money too. Even won cashbacks. Here are mentioned some of them.

Gopinathan, 33, once lauded for his work during the 2018 Kerala floods, had quit the coveted government job on August 21st

Additional NEWS on the IAS: (Use your common sense while going through this section)

Now it has come to light that the IAS officer's move followed a show-cause notice served on him on July 8, in which the Home  Ministry had proposed for appropriate disciplinary action from the Union  Territory of Daman and Diu, and Dadar and Nagar Haveli in his case.

The ministry has accused him of taking nine months to process policy matters, delaying assignments of underground electrical cabling,  non-submission of a report from flood-affected Kerala and of failing to submit a file related to nominations for the Prime Minister’s Award for  State/Union Territories in public administration.

“When people have corruption charges, CBI inquiries and stuff going on, they are saying I didn’t apply for the PM award and did not submit two reports. For that, they are charge sheeting me,” Gopinathan said. “I  think I’ll be the only officer in history who has been charge-sheeted for  not applying for an award.”

He was also accused of bypassing the chain of command while submitting files.

In one of the points, the memo directs Gopinathan to not “bring or attempt to bring any political or outside influence” regarding matters pertaining to his service.

“Why is the home ministry worried that they can easily be influenced by a politician? The only politician who influences the home ministry is the home minister,” he said. “If I can influence him in any way, I’d like to request him to restore the fundamental rights of the people of Kashmir immediately. It  has been 90 days.”

I also understand that this may not be the best time to post this, but my family is in a sticky situation, and any word of advice would be appreciated. 

My father is suffering from [trigeminal neuralgia](https://www.webmd.com/g00/pain-management/guide/trigeminal-neuralgia?i10c.ua=1&i10c.encReferrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8%3d&i10c.dv=21), and his facial pain is at a fairly advanced stage. After multiple consultations with various neurologists and neurosurgeons in Pune and Mumbai, we've decided to choose an invasive procedure (Microvascular decompression), and we were thinking of getting the surgery scheduled at Kokilaben hospital in Mumbai. 

Though I've multiple concerns at this point, it would be great if anyone can share their experience with the hospital. Particularly, we are interested in understanding the a) staff behavior at the hospital (think giving attention to the patient, quick response time for emergencies etc.), b) facilities and infrastructure, c) cleanliness and associated safety norms, and d) fairness in pricing. 

India's medical sector is very difficult to understand and navigate through, and ours is not a family with many 'contacts' in Mumbai or otherwise. So any kind of information will be appreciated.

Key points: In December 2003, the BJP government by Vajpayee notified rules for the preparation for NPR (National Population Register). This states that the enumerator of the NPR will give their opinion on the doubtfulness of the citizenship of any individual, and that would be the basis on which the NRC would be prepared. The Modi government reiterated in the Rajya Sabha that the NPR will be the basis for NRC. At least 12 chief ministers have declared that they will not enumerate the NRC in their states. But given the fact that NPR is the basis of NRC, these states and these chief ministers must also announce that they will stop the NPR process as well in their states.",1577265950.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,35

2849,"A case for English as national languageIn the midst of CAA/NRC protest which is fighting for religious freedom I would like to make a case for English as national language to protect the cultural identity of linguistic minorities. Excuse me for any grammatical mistakes.

In 1925, Gandhi proposed Hindi as a national language for India. Indian National Congress (INC) took the initiative of spreading Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states. INC who had just won the 1935 election made Hindi compulsory in schools of Madras presidency. INC never discussed the language policy with people of the presidency. South Indian leaders such as E.V.Ramasamy (Periyar) firmly opposed the move. There was a growing concern in regards to Madras presidency joining the Indian union where South Indians would be dominated by their Northern counterparts. 

Even after 72 years of independence MPs have to request for special permission in parliament in order to speak regional languages. Making Hindi the official language failed in 1937, 1946, 1968, 1986 and 2014. North Indian policy makers are relentlessly trying to make Hindi as National language on every opportunity. My question is why don’t they learn from the past? Now the modi government trying another go at language, religion and culture. 

This absurdity doesn’t stop there, every single policy is focused on northern India neglecting the South. Policy making is influenced by the Hindi speaking states which proponents for Hindi-Hindu-Hindustani. If South Indians don’t want to speak Hindi or they don’t agree with the policy, they are labeled as anti government or anti India. Take for example of foreign policy regarding Sri Lanka, Rajiv Gandhi government reversed the policy of supporting Tamils in Sri Lanka. This not only supported a repressive leaders like Premadasa it also went against the wishes of the people of Tamil Nadu. 

It may seem off topic talking about religion in the context of language. We need to understand how British classified Indians and how we feel the repercussions still now. Due to numerical superiority of Hindustani people, British decided to lump every Indian under Hinduism except for Buddhism, Jainism and sikhism. While this may be true to a certain extent this is not applicable number of groups e.g Most south Indian groups worship their ancestors. Some might argue this is the beauty of Hinduism. However, this is far from the truth. Hinduism is based on Vedas and upanishads. Hinduism follows manu dharma and categorizes people based on varnashrama. 

South Indians never had any scriptures that dictated social order or hierarchy. So what’s the impact of labelling south Indians as Hindus? As per Hindu/Hindustani culture we are categorized as sudhras. We are not Hindus because we were never part of Hindu/Hindustani culture. Some would argue there are a number of temples in south India so South Indians must be Hindus. Most Siva or Vishnu temples were built by past kings who were influenced by Hinduism. At the time it never reflected the actual practice of the people. Most south Indians, except for brahmins worship family god. i.e In the case of Tamils we worship Amman, Murugan, Karupusamay, Sudalai, Madasamy etc. These gods have nothing to do with Hinduism or Vedas.

Okay so most south Indians are not Hindus so what? what’s the problem in speaking Hindi. When our kings were influenced by Hinduism it affected our social order by labelling certain groups as untouchables. This social order never existed during 2nd century BC. The proof of social harmony can be found in literature like manimekalai, Seevaga Chinthamani, Silappatikaram and etc. 

So why we don’t want to speak Hindi? It is very simple, Hindi will establish the Hindu-Hindi-Hindustani culture in southern India. I want to tell all my Hindustani brothers we don’t follow your culture we have our own unique culture so please stop patronising us and don’t impose your language and culture on us. 

English is a global language and used by businesses around the world. Every single discovery and invention is documented in English. Learning English will open door to wealth of knowledge. That certainly is not the case for learning Hindi. Countries like Japan and 

China know the importance of English. They have started to learn English to compete in this increasingly competitive world. So let us not kid ourselves into learning Hindi.",1577285134.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,27,29

2880,"Some thoughts and questions on CAAI've been trying to read more about the topic, especially the viewpoints of those supporting CAA. Here are some questions I've thought about, that I believe we should be asking the government. I'd like if you guys (irrespective if you support the legislation or not) could correct me if any of these questions are factually incorrect or already addressed, and give me your own thoughts.

&#x200B;

1.Since CAA applies to giving citizenship and not refuge, why is there a need to fast-track the naturalization process for only some communities? I would understand the argument that these minorities do not have anywhere else to go to (though I think it has flaws too, but I'll get to it later), but remember, we aren't talking about giving humanitarian respite to these communities, refuge is already provided to them, we are only giving them citizenship. So why do some communities deserve voting rights and other citizenship rights faster than others?

2. Coming to the argument that there are 150 or so Islamic states, but only 1 country for Hindus/ other communities:

* This is factually incorrect- Nepal also has a majority Hindu population
* We must remember that India is a secular democracy, so any particular community has as much ""right"" over India as it has over any other secular democracy (US or Canada for example). So in fact these persecuted minorities ALSO have \~100 other countries to go to (That is not to say that they aren't welcome in India, but that they are only as welcome as in any other secular nation)
* By this argument, Christians also have many other countries that they can go to, so why include them ?

&#x200B;

3. On the argument that persecution of Ahmadiyyas and Shias shouldn't be classified as ""religious"", since they are within the same religious denomination ie. their persecution is ""sectarian"":

* Pakistan's state religion is SUNNI ISLAM, hence the Shias are in my understanding not under the state religion. So why is persecution of other minorities with different religion than that of State considered religious, but their persecution sectarian?
* The Ahmadiyyas in Pakistan are OFFICIALLY recognized as NON-MUSLIMS, so their religion is again different than that of State, in fact, they are not even within the same religious denomination according to Pakistani law, so the above question also applies to them.

&#x200B;

4. Why are other religious minorities- Atheists, Jews, followers of Baha'i faith etc. not included in the law?

5. A frequent argument is why not include Tamil Hindus and Muslim in Sri Lanka, to which a frequent response is that their situation has improved over the past years. But the same could be said for Afghanistan, which has seen more religious freedom post-Taliban, so why include them?

6. To the argument that only Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are included because they have an official state religion: Why not include Bhutan? Bhutan too has an official state religion- Vajrayana Buddhism.

2957,"Queries on NRCThis is a question, as well as a doubt.

Suppose the NRC fixes an arbitrary date say in 70s. It can till 1951, and we must remember that in Forest Rights act they ask for 3 generations or 75 years proof from tribals, (and we know how much legal and educational awareness they have, and in the new forest act draft they have even asked to evict such persons who can't produce such proof by use of force) , so obviously they can ask us too.

Now say X is a hindu.

X does have papers so that he qualifies as a citizen of india.

But X doesn't have access to papers which prove Xs father, who was alive post the cut off date was a citizen. Xs father is deceased and X owns the land of his father.

Going by the family tree method and the declaration of Gauhati HC regarding assam NRC and the fact that it serves as a precedent Xs father and X himself becomes illegal migrant. Because X fails to qualify by 2004 criteria, since his father is not a citizen (being a son of an illegal migrant, is an illegal migrant).

So, X regains his citizenship via CAA and all his self earned property. 

But here I have 3 questions

1. The govt can confiscate the property of his father given he remained an illegal migrant, can't it? So there can't be a legal claim of X owning such property that his father ""illegally"" owned in the first place.

2. What will be the legal status of Xs deceased father?

3. What will be the legal status of muslim orphans?",1577266389.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,9,17
2958,"Silly Question on CAA-NRC and Humanitarian RefugeThe whole defense behind CAA is that on religious grounds, persecuted minorities will he given haven and a dignified life. Sounds good on paper right? Two points I want to make/questions to ask.


The whole conceptof NRC revolves around taking Indians that have been living here peacefully(and we all know how Muslims are targetted) and putting them in detention centres. If you watch the videos and articles about detention centres in Assam, you will see how there is no humanity or dignity in the way they are made to live.



How can you cry 'humanity and persecution' while persecuting people.

PS: people may argue about living here illegally being a crime, but if you look around and read, there are people without the required documents. Secondly why bring in Aadhar cards claiming they are the final proof of nationality beyond a passport and do this 



In fact, the CAA itself, without NRC contradicts its own claims of humanitarianism. You cannot be partially humanitarian and if an NGO says 'we have resources to help underprivledged children, but only from a certain communities as other communities have their own NGOs', then you can already immagine the outrage. The BJP cannot make claims of being humanitarian while also helping only certain persecuted groups.

Finally, how does someone coming from abroad or someone already in India even prove persecution or the fact that they are not Muslim. Your Aadhar and Passport dont mention either. The fact that we are buying unimplementable pipe dreams and the ones selling them keep on and on with contradicting statements needs to be resolved",1577273765.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,9

But when we both visit India at the same time, it's a little tricky because my mobile has the SIM linked to the Ola account, she has a different SIM in her phone. She can sign into the app with the OTP I get and book rides the same way.

I would really appreciate if you can shed some light on effects of drinking too much tea and ways to bring down tea consumption if it would be beneficial to do so. It would be great to hear from you if you have had a similar experience and how you managed to control your addiction. Thank you!

3025,Need Advise(Serious)I am using a throwaway account.So my father works as a clerk in a bank and his salary is around 57000. He started a business few years ago which went downhill pretty quickly and now he has a debt of 36 lakhs.  He has taken all the staff loans available from the bank and also has a housing loan of 8 lakhs. We decided to take a top up loan on our house but we are only getting an amount of 15 lakhs (because his cibil score is very low and has only 6 years left for retirement) off which 8 lakhs will be paid as the house loan and we will get only 7 lakhs in our hand which is not enough to pay off the debt. He took 20 lakhs from two of his friends who have told us that instead of taking a top loan they are willing to buy our house which is worth 24 lakhs. So there are two options in front of us. One to take the top up loan which will save our house but we have to pay heavy EMIs and his cibil score will never improve because of it. The second one is to sell our house to his friends and to pay the remaining 4 lakhs and clear off his staff loans. The friend is allowing us to stay in the house without rent for one year and after that we have to pay him the rent as long as we want to live in that house and he has also told us that we can buy the house back if we have money in future. According to me the second option is much better because even though we lose our house we can stay comfortably with his salary and I also earn around 10000 as well. I have just completed my graduation and joined a company as a trainee. I just wanted your advise to know whether I am taking the right decision or not. I know all of you might think that second option is a no brainer but he worked really hard to buy that house and now he has to lose it but he has to make the tough choice because there is no point in saving the house and being stressed all the time.

His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data. AMA on 25th December, 6 PM i.e Today!Hello r/India,

We will be hosting Srinivas Kodali in an AMA today 6 PM. He is an independent researcher who has been documenting the Aadhaar project along with several other researchers. His work made him file public interest litigation against the illegal voter deletions by ECI using Aadhaar and NPR data.

On our request, he sent us the following text explaining the significance of NPR.

> The national population register is a very old project whose pilot implementation dates back to 1986 in rural rajasthan. The project came into the mainstream after the kargil war of 1999 when India realised it can't identify the foreigners from indians. During a conference of chief ministers on internal security in 2001, the project was approved. Part of the project every indian was supposed to be distributed Multi Purpose National Identity Cards, which were essentially smart card with fingerprints stored in chip. While this project was being piloted, India went through another attack on 26/11/08 in Mumbai by pakistani terrorists posing as fishermen.  This is the first time cards were started being distributed to fishermen and so on. 

> But post 26/11, due to the heavy intelligence failures multiple other databases like NATGRID, CCTNS, CMS, Aadhaar poppped up. Aadhaar project and NPR were very similar. So to deal with it, the cabinet combined both of them, the registar general of india became a registrar under UIDAI and started distributing Aadhaar. The deal was NPR will get biometrics from UIDAI post de-duplication, but the supreme court stopped all of this by ordering no biometrics will be shared with anyone. 

> After all of this, NPR project continued and was updated part of 2011 census and again in 2015. The project in itself is the start of National Register of Citizens. NPR data will be used to disclose a list of citizens and the ones not in it will be classified as foreign residents.

His Twitter: https://twitter.com/digitaldutta

Recently he published an article on NRC-NPR-Aadhaar nexus on thewire.in. Please feel free to go through it ~ [Digital India on Steroids: How Aadhaar Infra Enables the NPR and the NRC. The NPR is the 'mother' database for a potential NRC, but it needs verification of biometrics from the UIDAI.](https://thewire.in/tech/aadhaar-infra-npr-nrc)

This is unofficial as it is an opinion of the students of Jadavpur University, here's how it goes  
To,  
*The Hon'ble Ex-Chancellor, Jadavpur University.*   
SUBJECT: **Letter of Rustication to Kindly Terminate your Hon'ble Services Effective Immediately.**   
Sir,  
It has come to the attention of the general students of Jadavpur University that you were present on the premises of Jadavpur University in the evening of 19.9.2019, along with miscreants who hurled bombs, sexually assaulted women and vandalized sections of the university. Furthermore, you arrived uninvited to Jadavpur University on 22.12.2019. We have investigated your behavior and motives and come to the conclusion that they are shameless attempts to seek attention from students, thereby wasting our valuable time.   
Furthermore, on 23.12.2019, as part of the ongoing evaluation of university officials by students, you were asked a number of questions about the NRC, NPR, CAA; the SC/ ST Commission, violence unleashed on Muslim and other students and so on. We have found your responses to these questions unsatisfactory. They were as innocent of knowledge about BJP led police brutality on Muslim and other students as you are innocent of integrity. Academically speaking, your thesis holds no water and your defense is weak. Moreover, the students are convinced that your decision to stir up violence against students at Jadavpur University follows the party line of the Bharatiya Janata Party. We regret to inform you that we cannot attest to an unblemished record in your character certificate either.   
Keeping the above in mind, you are being informed of your rustication from the position of Chancellor of Jadavpur University. The students' body of Jadavpur University has also decided to disown you from the position of the Hon'ble Governor of West Bengal.   
**Your report card has been attached for your benefit.**   
**General Knowledge**: Less than satisfactory   
**Argumentative capability**: Poor   
**Sense of history**: Nil   
**Strengths**: Unwavering dedication to ignoring violence against students, activists and Muslims.   
**Overall character**: Spineless

Suppose the NRC fixes an arbitrary date say in 70s

Now say X is a hindu.

X does have papers so that he qualifies as a citizen of india.

But X doesn't have access to papers which prove Xs father, who was alive post the cut off date was a citizen. Xs father is deceased and X owns the land of his father.

Going by the family tree method and the declaration of Gauhati HC regarding assam NRC and the fact that it serves as a precedent Xs father and X himself becomes illegal migrant. Because X fails to qualify by 2004 criteria, since his father is not a citizen (being a son of an illegal migrant, is an illegal migrant).

So, X regains his citizenship via CAA and all his self earned property. 

But here I have 2 questions

1. The govt can confiscate the property of his father given he remained an illegal migrant, can't it? So there can't be a legal claim of X owning such property that his father ""illegally"" owned in the first place.

2. What will be the legal status of Xs deceased father?",1577198988.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,1,3

3159,"how do you deal with an abusive mother? (If you have one like that)I don't know if this is the right place to post. If not, I would love to know where should I post. I come from a middle class family. I live with my mother who is a homemaker. I do a small shop based business. My mother is verbally abusive. She uses all kind of dirty languages which sometimes get on my nerves. Growing up, I saw my parents quarrel all the time. I plan to escape this house after I finish college. But fate has it, my father passed away months after I finish the college. I did not get a job as I am not skilled well. So I am stuck with my mother in a rented house all these years. Even if I try to go to another city and did find a job, I wouldn't be able to afford to pay rent of both houses and expenses with the little amount I would get from a job. I always try to be nice and polite. I ask for help or tell any kind of suggestions to some tiny things at home, she will get on her nerve and starts to abuse me. She disrespects me. She use abusive words to disregard me. She always abuse a girl connecting with me. She thinks I have a girlfriend and everything I do against her (as she thinks) is because of this girl (imaginary). I don't have one, never had one. Because of my mother, I was even reluctant to find a partner. Sometimes I find girls repellent because imagining how mother would describe them with downright bad words. I always wanted to be loved. Because of my terrible childhood and growing up this way, I was very bad at conversations and making good acquaintances. 

Whenever she makes a remark about this girl (imaginary) with me, it makes me feel so cringy. I get so furious and frustrated. I yell inside my mind 'THERE IS NO GIRL LIKE THAT IN MY LIFE. LOOK AT WHAT YOU MADE. NO ONE HAS EVER LOVED THIS USELESS SHIT BUT YOU TALK LIKE I AM SOME KIND OF FUCKBOI WITH ALL THE GIRLS IN THE WORLD'. Sometimes I had wished my mother would just die. Sometimes I had wished my father had killed her(he was a drunkard and they always quarrel and abuse). Sometimes I wish I do it. But I won't.  I have so many dreams. I have grown up hoping for a good, decent normal life. I hope I will get it some day. I am at the age where everyone is talking about arrange marriage. I have never found love. I won't get married because I know my mother well. I won't spoil anyone's life. I don't know if I will ever find love, but I won't get into an arrange marriage and live with my mother.

P.s: some things my mother say. If I ask for a separate bowl to keep curry (she always put everything in a steel plate which I hate), she would say ask your pussy girl to do that for you. 

If I ever try to reply to her abuses she would say, oh that stupid bitch is doing everything. Go lick her vagina. You useless son of a bitch. Because of some pussy out there you are shouting at me.

'Why don't you go bite that bitch's cunt and ask her to do what you want'.

It's so disgusting and sad for me to type all this here. I am really sorry. I hate the way she disrespect a girl even though she is imaginary. But there are girls who shows interest on me.

I truly believe that this is because first amd foremost because Indians don't have a sense of belonging for the public property. Indians don't consider a road as ""our road"" or a footpath as ""our footpath"" before throwing trash on it or before stealing the street lamp from that footpath.

Now, I understand that the one's stealing are people trying to make ends meet by acquiring the fastest and easiest possible means of money possible. But what do we have to say about all the public busses burned or the shops destroyed or the police vans destroyed or whole trains stopped and desteoyed or the roads littered with all kinds of garbage which people throw out of their Toyota Fortuners and such.

These Indians completely surpasses my understanding as to why they would want to hurt themselves like this. I say themselves because all that they're destroying is paid for by them. By their taxes. If they pay anything at all that is. 

From illiterate, unfortunate, poor farmers trying to make ends meet and protesting for better prices for their hard grown crop, to well educated top tier lawyers destroying and setting fire to their own workplace because it's govt owned. I won't see these lawyers setting fire to their private offices.

https://youtu.be/bjiLDiEJARQ?list=WL&t=608   
https://youtu.be/bjiLDiEJARQ?list=WL&t=657  

This ""look"" consists of extremely dark skin, and a very sharply defined distinct nose.  Usually much more distinct than the average lighter-skinned people around them.    

I do not think this physical type has anything to do with Indoeuropeans; the people are usually *extremely* dark skinned, and they often seem to be from Dalit groups in Southern India.  They're not even ""brown"", but straight up ""black"".  

My suspicion is that this look was associated with an ancient group of people who no longer exist in their pure form.  These people were possibly responsible for the pre-Indoeuropean spread of the R haplogroup; which probably originated near India or Southeast Asia.  It should be noted that the famous Mal'ta Boy individual, with the oldest instance of the R haplogroup, has [Indian ancestry.](https://imgur.com/a/WFMBeks)

Is there any sort of ethnic tension between Dravidian groups and *non-Dravidian/Aryan* groups in the South?

3175,"A case against Indira Gandhi to have created today's class of Uncles and AuntiesRight after independence, our leaders were some of the most well meaning people, who fought for independence, most likely suffered imprisonment for it too. They were also very intelligent. Despite the challenges and difference in opinions they had best of intentions in their hearts.

Then came Indira Gandhi.

Now I dont know how much sexism or other discriminatory feelings were involved, but she had challenges within Congress. Instead of bringing people together though, she broke Congress and formed a new Congress named Congress(I). Some people joined her, some didnt. After it was clear she was gonna lose Lok Sabha seat in supreme court decision, she called for emergency. This was not an emergency on the country, but on her seat. It was personal. She imprisoned leaders, a lot of them Nehruvian, freedom fighter, well meaning people. Love for the country, honesty became secondary traits, obedience to her became primary traits.

Through all these actions, she got what she wanted, but she fundamentally changed who succeeds in politics and the entire political culture. In order to succeed in politics, you need two attributes:

1. Guarantee election victory
2. Kiss party high command's ass

The great task of building a nation, building law enforcement, judiciary system etc. went on a backburner. What was left was just keep the lights on, keep the people calm enough that they dont cause ruckus, and enjoy ruling the country. So came 80's, 90's, 00's. People got used to this new culture. They never thought of questioning the government. The ones who knew how to question the govt gave up, because it was futile. The stereotype of 'Netas' became common. Even gunda's, rioteers can become Neta, and succeed as long as they follow above two rules. Every 5 years you elect a new dictator and try your luck. Some good things happen, but people of the nation basically feel helpless. They feel they dont matter. Netas started to not even care what their people are saying, coz it doesnt matter.

Throughout these 3 decades people completely gave up on Netas and did not expect them to be accountable, far less even talk about their problems. These are all the uncles and aunties.

In comes Modi. He talks to people, he projects a confident image, shows that he  cares about india. He cleverly hides his ulterior motives and incompetency. But these people feel good about the government. These uncles and aunties feel heard by a leader. Which is big. Anybody trying to give them any logical answer is somebody trying to take them back to the days when nobody cared about them.

These people are so used to these politicians that they have stopped holding politicians at a higher standards of integrity, patriotism etc. Anything bad Modi does, people have done it in the past. Gujrat 2002? 1984, and you still kept those netas. Hate it as much as you want, but thats a valid argument. Congress doesnt get to criticize someone for the things they themselves condoned. Modi has cleverly hidden systematically breaking of democratic systems, but rest anything bad, that has been done by the Netas in the past. No big deal. Lying, not keeping promise, misleading. These people are used to it.

3190,"Not so frequently asked questions about NPR (yet)**What is this NPR I am suddenly hearing about?**

NPR stands for National Population Register. It was defined and explained in the Citizenship Rules, 2003 (see link below), which were formed to execute the Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. The first data collection for the NPR happened along with the last census in 2010. The data was then updated in 2015.

**Who is affected by this?**

Every ""usual resident"" of India. If you generally live in an area in India (for past 6 months or more, or plan to live for next 6 months or more), you are required to provide the data. It covers you whether you are a citizen or not. On the other hand, citizens who are not normally resident (NRIs) are not covered.

**Oh, so it's like census in regards of who it covers and the way it is collected. What kind of data do they want?**

Some of the data is similar to the census form.

**Huh? But we already have the census for that. Why do we need this?**

Well, the census data collection comes under the Census act of 1948 and that data cannot be used for any other activity. The purpose of that data is to use it for planning and other welfare programs. It's confidential and anonymized.

The NPR data is collected under the Citizenship Act of 1955 and Citizenship Amendment Act of 2003. It won't be anonymized, nor will it be confidential. The purpose for this data is to help ascertain citizenship of an individual.

**What is different this time vs the 2010 collection?**

The differences are really the key. From a questionnaire taken from a pilot project that began in August, apparently you will now also need to tell the place of birth of your parents (do you have an idea of why they would need that? Wink, wink). This is a new data point and was not there in the original NPR (2010) data collection.

Also for the first time - you will be asked for numbers of your Aadhaar, driver's license, voter identity card, and mobile phone, if you have them. 

And did I tell you it's not planned to be anonymized or secured?

**Goodness! When is this happening?**

There was a gazette notification (see link below) issued in July 2019 by the government to prepare and update the Population Register in every state other than Assam. The field work will happen between April 1 and Sep. 30 of 2020. Expect a knock on your door then.

**But why are some people tying it to the NRC? It has nothing to do with that, right?**

Actually, the whole purpose of the National Population Register (NPR) is to collect the primary data for the National Register of Citizenship (NRC). This is really the first step. The NPR is supposed to create a list of all the residents of the country and then the NRC would take that list and identify people of “doubtful citizenship” – thus, by corollary creating a list of citizens."" (See the Rules document linked below)

**Hmm.. ""Doubtful citizenship"" sounds like a vague term. Who is going to determine that?**

Once you submit the data for the NPR, it will be verified for the purposes of preparation and inclusion in the NRC. The Local Registrar and their helper staff will scrutinize every single data point for each individual to come up with that decision. If they find that you citizenship is ""doubtful"" they will add a remark in the Population Register and inform you after the process is over.

**Don't tell me that “doubtful citizen” remark will really be used for the NRC.**

Come on. Of course it will be. We are not paying our Baabus for nothing. The final National Register of Citizens would be prepared by asking doubtful citizens to prove they are Indians as part of a “claims and objections” process.

**So, then it's my responsibility to remove the doubts of Sarkaari Baabus to be considered a citizen?**

Yes, but hey, you also have a right to cast doubt on others. A draft of the local register of the NRC will be publicly available. You can actually check your nosy neighbor's details and if your relationship is not cordial, can cast doubt on their information. You can object to the citizenship or a particular information of anyone before it goes into the final NRC. Of course, others can do that to you as well.

A fucking stupid rant to show that 'saab madarchod hai'

Recently saw this CAB and NRC shit. Okay , and I don't fucking care. I am uneducated and extremely unaware of what the fuck is NRC and , oops sorry , I do not need the 'elitist' or even the 'dehati' explaination for this shit.

Now look at this RAGEFUL RANT OF MINE.

At first , I was a very innocent , brave 'liberal' fighter and a ACCHHA baccha. I supported anti-BJP and anti-RSS ideology coz why not , I am a city based educated launda .

But , I did refer to some right wing channel and I was hurt that Hinduism was the butt of ridicule of these elitist rich kids and so , I went this time for pro-conservative ideas.

I saw communal fights between Hindu and Muslim groups , and so like a FUCKING LOSER AND COWARD , switched my ideology to liberal again.

UNTIL I SAW THIS FUCKING ENRAGING PICTURE.

[https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/as-anti-caa-protesters-desecrate-om-as-a-nazi-symbol-heres-how-its-actually-islamism-that-idealises-hitler?utm\_source=quora&utm\_medium=referral](https://swarajyamag.com/news-brief/as-anti-caa-protesters-desecrate-om-as-a-nazi-symbol-heres-how-its-actually-islamism-that-idealises-hitler?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=referral)

Now one question.

Why is my religion a tool for mocking and grouping of ignorant people?

Why are these elitist 'atheist' randi going after our religion , when they clearly know that we are not the villains?

WHY?

Okay done?

Now look at this-

[https://scroll.in/article/947626/why-kill-our-children-blood-and-tears-in-an-uttar-pradesh-town](https://scroll.in/article/947626/why-kill-our-children-blood-and-tears-in-an-uttar-pradesh-town)

What?

Why did the police have to do this? Why? Isn't 'athiti devo bhavo' our motto? Okay , they're not even outsider, but a proud Indian , working their asses off to survive. Their kids did not have to die.

Now tell me , who the FUCK should I  side with ?

BOTH OUR LEFT AND RIGHT WINGS ARE TOXIC AND MISLEADING TRASH , AND SCUMS TO THE LOWEST LEVELS.

This is what I have realized today. The difference between those two and me are circumstances and societal status.

The rich love to wage wars , just as we say , these students invoked people to burn OUR TAXES and the poor , they will always want to stay ignorant and act without thinking.

WHY AM I ANGRY?

BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT TO BE A PART OF THIS SHIT. I DON'T WANT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.

I want to survive , and live my life.

My request is that people , please start supporting a ideology with your brains , on both the perspectives.

Thank you all for reading.",1577205141.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,9,10

I didn't bribe the policemen as they also didn't ask for it rather they talked to me in very rude manner saying that I don't have any right to apply from aligarh when my hometown is Patna where by the way I am not staying for more than a year. I have been living in Aligarh for more than a year but they seem to not listen now they have sent an adverse report. They sent the report after 22 days which itself looks fishy as if I didn't have proper documents or anything why didn't they just sent the report soon why the delay?

2- **Internet Shutdown**, we saw Internet going down on multiple occasions, a new weapon in the government's arsenal to curb dissent, and arguably the most fav.

3- **Section 144**, another fav weapon, used to curb dissent, misused to kill dissent

4- **Misinformation** a real threat, IT cell goons spread blunt and fabricated pieces of information to discredit dissent.

5- **Fake violence** \- oldest trick in the book, staging fake protesters to be violent, to discredit the protesters.

6 - **pro-government rallys** to idk do what, but okay

7- And most important, **detention of leaders**, who are peacefully protesting, and use of the draconian UAPA against leaders to further discredit them. 

8- **police incited violence**, police weirdly acted as government goons and were brutal

3270,"Rants of a UPSC CSE aspirantsBig Picture (RSTV) has turned out to be an essential fodder for UPSC Civil Services Examination. It is extremely informative. 

I used to follow it diligently since May last year. Till a few months before Lok Sabha election. Their earlier balanced panel started turning pro-govt. Earlier diverse views started to align with govt policies on almost every single topic. So much so that all comments by UPSC aspirants on their YouTube videos are all same - pro govt. And nobody talks about it.

Some even suggest not to have an ideology for getting through interview safely. I could be wrong but what kind of a knowledgeable person not have a vision (plan) of what a better world could be?

I also sometime worry what kind of candidates the commission chooses. People having only theoretical knowledge. No compassion. No desire to uplift the vulnerable sections. No desire for inclusiveness. 

Many *young* IAS officers blatantly casteist on Quora. Fewer people having a spine to speak their heart out.

3271,"Harsha Bhogle on the ongoing issueI think young India is speaking to us. It is telling us what it wants to be; and that it doesn't want to be what we are telling it to be.

&#x200B;

For many years now, I have been bullish on India. There is a reason. My generation grew up in an India that was still feeling the after effects of being plundered by colonial England. My parents' generation weren't just short on resources, they also had their confidence sucked away by a terrible, repressive environment. We were luckier but we still didn't know what we were capable of 

&#x200B;

I was in my early 30s when two quiet gentlemen brought about a revolution. Maybe Narasimha Rao was forced into opening up India by the calamity that would have befallen us otherwise. Maybe Manmohan Singh had no choice but to deliver the budgets he did. But they saw the writing on the wall and they acted 

&#x200B;

The effects of liberalisation on my generation were beyond what we could have dreamt of. If at 32, I was asked to imagine an India of opportunity, I wouldn't have imagined half of what I was privileged to see. As India opened up we were allowed to believe we could be as good as anyone else in the world. And to our great joy, we discovered that we were indeed as good. We had never thought of ourselves that way. We became the blessed generation and our children benefited from it, they dreamt higher than we knew.

&#x200B;

India under 30 now is brimming with possibility. Their minds have been opened, they are proud Indians but they are citizens of the world. And India under 40 is showing that it has the ability to take on the world by getting into leadership positions. This India is more confident, better informed, more aware and far more ambitious than we could ever have been. It is a beautiful India and it has been nurtured by people who are liberal and secular at heart. Those are beautiful words.

&#x200B;

So what should we, the generation that reaped the benefits of liberalisation and openness, be doing for the next? Quite simply, putting an arm round their shoulder, patting them on the back and getting out of their way for we can at best be the banks to their rivers.

&#x200B;

This is a great time to be a benevolent government; to think of education, of infrastructure, of technology; to remove barriers, to embrace openness, to free this beautiful generation to take India beyond where we think it can be. 

&#x200B;

So why are we creating fear? Why are we driving wedges into society? Instead of giving this generation wings to fly, why are we putting a weight on their backs? Why are we obsessed about our neighbours when, as an economic entity, they aren't even in the same book, let alone on the same page as us?. We are shrinking our country by highlighting our differences and young India is telling us it isn't happy.

&#x200B;

So, other than writing lengthy emotional posts, something that is easy to do, what should my generation do? Forget changing the world, we can encourage five people, maybe ten and that will be enough. I have seen that happen in front of my eyes. At a low point in my career, I got to work with young people. Their energy was an eye-opener. All I had to do was pat them on the back sometimes, provide a window to a new world. No more. In the last three years, these young people have made CricBuzz an extraordinary success. It is just a small example in a small sector but it tells us what is possible.

&#x200B;

Winning elections isn't a good enough reason for highlighting differences between us. My naive view of the world tells me that creating opportunities through liberalisation and openness and togetherness could win more elections. 

&#x200B;

So my appeal to people in power, to those my age and older is simply this. We have played a very nice innings, we have been lucky to have been Indians for the last twenty five years. Let us not burden the next generation with talk of war and cultural differences. They are going to be better than we were. Let them be. In a happy, open, secular, liberal world, they can become the best in the world.

3294,"Scrap Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA) - UN Human Rights #ScrapCAA. Please read ""**I am Aamir, a proud Indian citizen and an Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) Alumnus living in Australia.** I have represented and won global awards for my country in social entrepreneurship and was recently awarded Young Entrepreneur of the Year in Australia. 

**But now, 200 million Indian Muslims and I are at risk.** The Indian government's introduction of **Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA) coupled with National Register of Citizens (NRC) - puts us Muslim citizens at the Modi Government's mercy and discretion for our residency status.** We fear we will be treated as second class citizens, or rendered stateless.

Here is why CAA (2019) is dangerous. It makes a promise to entertain requests for refugee and citizenship to all those ‘persecuted minorities’ from three Islamic countries, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who reached India before either 2014 or later. The amendments while giving special privileges only to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jain, Parsis and Christians from these three countries, singles out Muslims for exclusion. For example, neither the Ahmadiyas, who are undoubtedly persecuted in Pakistan, nor do possible asylum seekers like the Rohingyas from Myanmar or Tamils from Sri Lanka have any place here.

For the first time in my country, there is a statutory attempt to not just privileged people from some faiths but at the same time relegate another, Muslims, to second-rate status.

The proposed amendments to India’s 1955 citizenship law (Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019) need to be strongly rejected on these counts alone, in that they are divisive and discriminatory in character. The CAB, 2019 is at odds with Constitutional secular principles and a violation of Articles 13, 14, 15, 16 and 21 which guarantees the right to equality, equality before the law and non discriminatory treatment by the Indian state.

**Sign my petition asking UN Human Rights Commission to condemn this move by the Indian government and urge it to scrap the Citizenship Amendment Act (2019). #ScrapCAA**  

If you believe in equality, justice and secularism, please raise your voice. Sign and share my petition so that this divisive law is scrapped and every Indian, irrespective of religion, feels safe in their homes.""

Despite the resounding victory for the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) and the Congress in state assembly elections the obvious observation that could be made was that there was still a decent number of seats that the BJP won. The vote for the BJP was also only 2% less than the JMM and Congress. For me this proved that the people have still not understood the problems associated with the BJP and still connect with the BJP either due to local issues, the fact that their ruling at the centre or due to their hindu identity or support their policies more specifically the recent Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of citizens. The latter is the most worrying and needs to be addressed opposition parties not just for the sake of votes and seats but to help bring secularism back to the state and society. 
Its just not this election. The Elections that were held in Maharashtra in October gave a victory for the two hindutva parties, the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party. Its another matter that there was a fallout between the two parties leading to the BJP resigning and the Shiv sena forming the government along with the Congress and NCP. The point remains that the people voted for Hindutva parties and now the Shiv Sena is now part of the government in the state. 

The same principle can be applied to Haryana as well. The common point being made is during these Protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of citizens the opposite is being reflected in the elections across the states. 
 
The kinds of engagement system that the political parties conduct will have to change, the rally system is not enough and door to door visits and speaking to small concerned groups such as farmers, teachers is required in order to change their views and clear misconceptions about other religious communities and legislations.

A diverse place they say.

A welcoming place they say.

A great place they say.

A place that prides itself on ""Satyameva Jayate"".


But that's all far from the truth.

We're all losing our patience. 

Day by day our government lies.

Day by day our talented people leave. 

Day by day our cities get polluted.

Day by day our infrastructure languishes.


And people say we have a lot of potential. 

Our economy is slowing. 

Our poverty rate is high.

Our educational system is abysmal. 

Our gender inequality is high. 


Just take a good look around. 

A Jewish state rapidly changed in seventy years. 

A German state rapidly changed in seventy years. 

An Italian state rapidly changed in seventy years. 

A Chinese state rapidly changed in seventy years. 


And they say that nothing lasts forever. 

But we've lost all patience. 

But we've lost our footing.

But we've under-performed immensely. 

But we've lost numerous people during and after the partition.

 ""They threatened me of dire consequences for betraying the cause of the tribals in the state by voting in favor of CAB in Parliament. I am an  MP from a party, which imposed a whip for voting in favor of CAB.  Everyone knows what could be the consequence if I had defied the party whip,"" he told reporters.  

""Illegal immigration should not be allowed to continue anymore. There was an influx of people to our state for the last 70 years. But in the  CAA, it was clearly mentioned that the law would not be applicable in sixth schedule areas. So, it can be said that the interest of the tribals in the state is protected,"" he said.

Asked whether he is concerned about NLFT's alleged threat, the MP said, ""It is a matter of concern because people are aware of their past violent activities. I  would meet the chief minister as well as Home Minister of the state,  Biplab Kumar Deb, tomorrow and apprise him about the threat from the insurgent outfit,"" Tripura said.

3474,"Documents of proof for the NRCThe declaration that documents such as Passport, Aadhar, Voting ID cannot be used as proof for the National Register of citizens is both nonsensical and illegal. If one goes to the dictionary definition and the legal definition what a passport is they will see that it is issued to only citizens after they have proved through various documents that they were born in the country and after verification by the police. The same with the Adhar Card, it certifies that a person is a legitimate citizen of the country after verification of various documents and is issued to only citizens of the country. Finally the voter ID card is only for the citizens of the country who are legally allowed to vote in this country. Hence the fact that these facts have been dismissed and discredited is nonsensical and illegal and this should be challenged and fought in the court of law before it is ever implemented. The people should not be afraid but instead fight to ensure that if the NRC if implemented it is smoother by just showing these documents.

> Details such as Name, Date of Birth, Sex, Present Address, Permanent Address, Names of Father, Mother and Spouse etc will be gathered by visiting each and every household. All usual residents will be eligible to be included irrespective of their Nationality. Each and every household will be given an Acknowledgement Slip at the time of enumeration. The data will then be entered into computers in the local language of the State as well as in English. Once this database has been created, biometrics such as photograph, 10 fingerprints and probably Iris information will be added for all persons aged 15 years and above. This will be done by arranging camps at every village and at the ward level in every town. Each household will be required to bring the Acknowledgement Slip to such camps. Those who miss these camps will be given the opportunity to present themselves at permanent NPR Centres to be set up at the Tehsil/Town level. In the next step, data will be printed out and displayed at prominent places within the village and ward for the public to see. **Objections will be sought and registered at this stage.** Each of these objections will then be enquired into by the local Revenue Department Officer and a proper disposal given in writing. Persons aggrieved by such order have a right of appeal to the Tehsildar and then to the District Collector. Once this process is over, the lists will be placed in the Gram Sabha in villages and the Ward Committee in towns. **Claims and Objections will be received at this stage also and dealt with in the same manner described above.** The Gram Sabha/Ward Committee has to give its clearance or objection within a fixed period of time after which it will be deemed that the lists have been cleared. The lists thus authenticated will then be sent to the Unique Identity Authority of India (UIDAI) for de-duplication and issue of UID Numbers. All duplicates will be eliminated at this stage based on comparison of biometrics. Unique ID numbers will also be generated for every person. The cleaned database along with the UID Number will then be sent back to the Office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner, India (ORG&CCI) and would form the National Population Register. As the UID system works on the basis of biometric de-duplication, in the case of persons of age 15 years and above (for whom biometrics is available), the UID Number will be available for each individual. For those below the age of 15 years (for whom biometrics is not available), the UID Number will be linked to the parent or guardian.

To settle personal and political vendettas, these objections were frequently raised for people in Assam and they had to repeatedly prove their ""Indianness"". 

> Outfits like the All Assam Students’ Union have raised objections to many names included in the draft NRC, forcing them to submit to time-consuming procedures. Objections were been filed against more than 2.5 lakh people who are on the draft list, mostly by the state’s powerful sub-nationalist outfits, such as the All Assam Students’ Union. 

> How people have been harassed by this system, Take the example of Bongaingaon’s Mokibul Islam, who appeared for his hearing on May 15 in Barpeta town. A person named Jyotishman Das had objected to his inclusion in the draft register. Islam, who works in a plastic factory in Guwahati, did not just have to travel all the way to Barpeta, 96 km away from Guwahati, for his hearing but also had to bring 13 of his relatives from different parts of Bongaigaon and Barpeta. They had all received summons from authorities to be present at the hearing. Although the objector, Das, failed to turn up, the National Register of Citizens official entrusted to deal with the case asked for Islam’s “legacy data code”, an 11-digit number attached to the person applicants trace their ancestry to. In Islam’s case, it is his grandfather, Simijuddin, who features in the 1966 electoral rolls.

3511,"What is NPR? How does it affect you?NPR is first step of the National Register of Indian Citizens, which is the other name of nation-wide NRC. NPR is a collation of all ‘usual residents’ living in India. Under the Citizenship Rules, 2003, a National Register of Indian Citizens is to be produced after filtering citizens from non-citizens. 

How is this filtering done?

First a local officer “verifies” the list & issues notice to “doubtful citizens” from list of local residents. These “doubtfuls” must now prove their citizenship. Following this, a draft list is published.
If you think your inclusion in the draft list is enough, it’s not, because the rules permit objections to the inclusion of any name on the list. Presumably, anyone can file an objection. The decision of your Indianness is made by an officer.

NPR also collects sensitive personal information of every Indian, including passport details (~5.5% of Indians have passports). 

Source : https://twitter.com/asadowaisi/status/1209158963603755011

Back-end for NRC already seems to be ready, see the login page, here http://lsi.gov.in/srs/nric/loginnric.aspx ([source](https://twitter.com/DilliDurAst/status/1209385926251540480))

Also, All-India NRC and CAA are both part of the same law, the Citizenship Act, added by Vajpayee-Advani in 2003 and Modi-Shah in 2019, respectively. [Vajpayee-Advani imagined an all-India NRC and Modi-Shah added a Muslim filter](https://theprint.in/opinion/vajpayee-advani-imagined-an-all-india-nrc-and-modi-shah-added-a-muslim-filter/339366/)

> As per the 2003 amendment, the Indian government shall count all its citizens and create a National Population Register or NPR. The government will then verify the citizenship of the people counted. Once it does, the verified citizens will become part of another document, the “National Register of Indian Citizens”.

[Union cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, approves over Rs 8500 crore for updating National Population Register](https://twitter.com/PTI_News/status/1209401270605209600)

Note that the NPR will be carried out alongside the Census -- so most people will be confused, thinking it is the census rather than first step of the NRC.

It's an absolutely immoral act and is done just to show there's space for discrimination in our constitution then tear it up and write it again.

BJP still paints an average muslim as a bearded skullcap donning man in a kurta pajama. But an average Hindu is painted as wearing western clothes.

Muslims are disproportionately lacking in literacy in India which I believe is largely due to systemic neglect.

But regressive ideologies cannot be countered just in classrooms. They have to be countered in every sphere of lives.

A majority of Muslims are also lacking in standing up for progressive values and I hate to admit that's a valid concern of BJP.

What are your thoughts on Uniform Civil Code?

I realise it's not the time to have these discussions but I don't want another maulvi to grab an MP seat right after we oust a yogi.

The stanzas of this poem are as much valid now as they were during the Independence movement, as free-thinking Indians today take a stand against bigotry, hatred, division and fascist nationalism.

As the government uses violence, intimidation and an atmosphere of fear to suppress dissent, let us remind them that this is a land which gave birth to many patriots ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country. That their violent tactics cannot suppress our voices.

Come, let us show them that we are the future of this country, and that we will absolutely not stand for their perverse ideals that subvert our India, Gandhi's India.

To make it worse she goes into this crap that india sucks for women , girls are raped , society is patriarchal , acid thrown on em eyc etc, badmouthing about india to some foreigner creep , then it got me thinking that we have 1.3billion people , and isnt it way too prejudicial to impose an anomaly as an identity tag , i mean yeah shit happens at times but look at the probability no , and considering that we are still transitioning from a feudal societ to an urban society definitely will have some backfires , but first u ask people to ask u anything , then u say u dont get offended , then u are stereotyping the entire 1.3billion people ,isnt it disturbing on so many levels , guys get murdered everyday , you dont hear us whining about how this is a country of man killers or that i am scared to go out , we have been beaten mocked , bullied ,mugged but we knew that only u can look out for yourself .

3646,"Thoughts on CAA ProtestsFrom the POV of a young man living in Delhi, I'm quite content with the state of affairs. Here are a bunch of thoughts. 

* We are a country with a broken opposition. Some people out there, students as well as locals, we uncomfortable with the government decision.  With no party trying to take a hard stand against the government, the moment was a people vs BJP one. 
* The repercussions can be felt in Modiji trying to take a softer stand and peddling lies about NRC.
* A peaceful show of number helps the system change. Politicians are clever people. They sense what people want. If people express their faith in a certain ideology then two things will happen.  1. There'll be new leaders emerging to fill the leadership vacuum for that ideology. 2. Existing leaders will shift their agenda towards it. LEADERS/POLITICIANS TEND TO FOLLOW THE MASSES. 

I hope this moment forge a path for tolerant and peaceful protests in India and cement our nation's social fabric.

3661,"The aim is 2022We just heard of the BJP loss in Jharkhand.  It is a momentous occasion for the opposition but not a monumental one. Disclaimer - I am not someone who is bent to pushing BJP to power or someone who is in BJP side of the line though I am a RW conservative (economically). Anyways the monumental shift which my hours of pondering tell me would be when BJP looses UP all these state are conveyer belt states one moment this hand next another. But UP loss would indicate a mood shift. UP represents the core voterbase of modi middle class and lower middle class. The first generation graduates. These are the people who are his success syrup. And it would be too ignorant and egoistic too assume that they are illeterate and anti muslim etcc .. These people are learned they know what they are doing what centre has to do is to understand why they are vary of them. Rather than brushing them off as bhakts and illeterates. 
Now on the winning strategy this is a golden chance for congress and sp/bsp to localise its cadre. BJP ministers are discontent with yogi and RSS doesnt favour him. The yadav+muslim+dalit formulae will work for the coalition (cong bsp sp) if they manage to forge one. But the problem this formula faced in ls 2019 was absence of Dalit elements. Dalits are voting for BJP exclusively.  Outreach by RSS towards Dalits also isnt helping much. So my last word to this incoherent mess would be if congress want a shot at 2024 ls they need to forge a good alliance with bsp and sp. begin Dalit outreach. Amit Shah doesnt win out of thin air he puts a lot of effort in man management and cadre mobilisation.

* Corruption, India is ranked 78 out of 180 as per Corruption Perceptions Index 2018, and it exists in every field.
* Standards of the education system are low and if we talk about education in rural areas, it even becomes worse.
* Healthcare systems and almost half of the population of villagers have no access to proper healthcare providers. Infant mortality rate, lack of nutrition and many still today have no proper basic sanitation facilities.
* Pollution and other environmental issues.
* The major issue now a day is women's safety. The news about the rape case is getting common.
* Low GDP Growth and economic problem.
* Increase in crime rates.
* Intolerance, Mob lynching.
* Violence periodically taking place, communal tensions and religion-based politics have become more prominent.
* Communalism, hatred speech, misuse of social media to spread false news and rumors.
