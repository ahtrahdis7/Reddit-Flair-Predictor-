16,"Is it common for some indians to lift the toilet seat and climb on it insteadI know this is a stupid question but for some months I live in a student house with a bunch of non western students like indians, syrians and somalians. I want to put a sign above the toilet saying that is not cool to take a shit all over the toilet (and not clean it) just because you want to climb on it instead of sitting on it. I want to write it in all three languages as well. 

Could I get some help with the Indian language warning one, please? And, would someone be so kind to explain to me if this is an indian thing or not... because I am confused and not willing to point fingers around my flatmates without being sure.",1586689944.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,0

84,"India's lockdown had near 0 effect on the spread of coronavirus in the countrySee the total cases on log scale here:
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/india/

it's a perfectly straight line since 7th March. Lockdown was enforced around 23rd March, and we should have seen a decline in slope a few days later if the lockdown had any significant effect in reducing the spread.

I know common logic says that lockdown is helping, but why doesn't the data say so?

One common argument i expect:
Slope would've increased if the lockdown wasn't in place
- this is not true. You can check data for countries without lockdowns and data for india between 7th March to 23rd March, straight line on the log plot is the natural expected graph for the exponential spread of the virus.",1586675459.0,,Coronavirus,dark,11,0
