"" Deterrence is not the only reason for significant penalties. Criminal laws indicate a community’s morals and values, restrain potentially violent offenders, and impose punishment for actions that society finds reprehensible. There may be strong policy justifications for increasing penalties based on those considerations. But, if the goal of a policy change is to deter crime, research suggests that an increase in the likelihood of being caught has a greater deterrent effect than an increase in the potential penalty.

18,"Self Defense Classes for Women's Safety is Overrated.Lot of comments on social media these past couple days about what precautions women should take when travelling alone or at night time and suggestions ranged from pepper spray to SOS apps to self defense classes.

While I agree with most of them, I have to talk about taking self defense classes.

I believe they are useless in a situation like the Hyderabad victim faced. No amount of groin kicking and eye poking techniques are going to help a woman overpower 3-4 men.

Even if you're an elite level boxer or mixed martial artist (most other forms of martial arts are useless in real life situations) you'd be able to take out one, maximum two guys.

The average male is significantly stronger than the average female. Women will be overpowered.

Please don't give them the illusion that a month or two of self defense classes organised by the local community or the police or the school/office is going to save their lives.

It won't. 

Please stick to pepper spray, knives, precautionary measures, situational awareness and whatnot. Do self defense but use it as a last resort, never rely on it as the primary weapon.

34,"Kesari Review: Just another Bollywood masala flick masquerading as a historical war movie.So now as it is available on Amazon Prime, I thought it might be good to warn you ahead. I have just wasted 3 hours of my life, I do not want you to do the same.

Kesari has got quite a few things surprisingly right, the filming location, sound editing, scenic designs and props are impressive. But the movie fails miserably when it comes to historical authenticity. **It does not respect the actual historical records, military traditions, war tactics or even the basic physics for that matter.** Akshay Kumar is a superhero with supernatural power to dodge bullets. I saw someone firing two rifles simultaneously, one from each hand. Poor guy died from recoil.

All movie is about Akshay Kumar, no character development for others. Parineeti Chopra is there on women's quota (seriously she has no freaking job being there).

79,"Who is accountable for all the rapes in this country?In the recent few days, I've seen a lot of news on rapes. It kept me wondering why does this keep happening even after such a massive roar from the Nirbhaya case.
Why hasn't the rate of this crime gone down? Why doesn't the perpetrators feel any fear? Why isn't the government taking any strict actions? Will more severe punishment help to bring down the number of rates?

These types of questions kept driving through my thoughts.
I tried to answer these with my opinions with no bias and being harsh and raw.

All these rapes occur due to the unsatisfied sexual urges, or due to some psychological impact, the perpetrator has gone through in his life. This isn't me making an excuse for the perpetrators but trying to understanding why a guy forces himself on a woman. Yes, the perpetrators are the ones who commit these heinous acts, but what about the factors which play in the background and lead to the crime itself?
I happen to believe that a happy person won't try to harm another being. A person who just finished his meal won't steal food. People who are unhappy depressed isolated and coming to this crime where they do not have a sexual life, the environment they grew, their work environment, their social life all pool up, and reck chaos on a woman's life and also her family.

The media also plays right into this. How they report such news and take interviews and depicting the crime in such details is very disturbing. Yes even if it is the truth on how she was violated, stating it on the news for all the country to know (it's just like the whole country violating a person's privacy) and not having a concern what the family must endure in front of her relatives and friends. 

The entertainment industry also is to be blamed. The kind of entertainment we are exposed to is very carnal. The stories and the blockbusters feed into this from item songs to the characters of few actors itself.
Movies don't portray the impact the effect of rape in society, but they represent rape like the media in a lewd manner.

Next comes the police on how they handle the cases. Complaining about an ordinary crime in this country is such a huge process and stressful. How will a woman even complain about rape? The police are very rude and not so helping it you don't have the right connections.

The judicial system is even worse for this matter. We follow the judiciary, which makes sure that the innocent aren't punished than punishing a criminal. The trail is long, and the victim is made to relive those moments again and again, that is, if she's survived the crime. A person who is assaulted physically is next attacked, mentally, and emotionally. After all, even if the perpetrators are found guilty, the punishment doesn't seem fair at all for the crime committed.

So I think instead of teaching the women how to carry weapons and be careful, the government should work on creating a healthy society. The male-female ratio should be considered. If a guy has a good life with a good income, he'll be happy with a wife a family. If a person is well settled and content, the crime rates drop, and making strict laws won't hurt anyone other than the perpetrator.",1575110949.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,19,29

The issue is, my father had expired a year back and he named my sister as legal heir to the the plot that we sold, my sister is 12yrs old and we got to know that we cannot sell property/plot of minor who has been named as legal heir.

Her sister went to RGIA Police Station to lodge a complaint, which is 10 minutes from the toll.

She was asked to file a complaint at Shamshabad Rural Police Station, where this useless debate over jurisdiction continued, and finally the FIR was filed at 3.10 AM, and the burnt body was found at 5AM.

And shamelessly, a Telangana Minister has quoted that instead of calling her sister, Priyanka should have called 100. For what? To debate the fucking jurisdiction of the incident?

As per the law, any emergency complaint can be lodged at any nearest police station, and the investigation/search can be initiated. Nowhere in the law, this useless pointer of 'jurisdiction' exists.

However, at the risk of a lot of fury, this is just a distraction being perpetrated by our lawmakers to appear 'tough on crime' and having to escape accountability.

#What we need is more investments in policing and law enforcement.

We currently have death penalty for terrorism, treason and many other acts. But still, they regularly occur. If death penalty is  really supposed to put the fear of consequences into people, why is it still happening?


More investment in police forces and law enforcement is the solution to rising crime. There are no quick fixes. 

The death penalty is a gross violation of human rights. No government, no matter how righteous or clean, should have the right to murder humans, and death penalty is exactly that. It is legalised murder.

We curse our government for the various crimes they over look, for the various scams they carry out, for the various lies they say and variety of other fuckery.

But at the same time, we trust the same government enough to never fuck up and execute an innocent man? Our judiciary and our government aren't gods. They are made up of humans and they can make mistakes, either accidentally or intentionally. However,  a wronful death penalty cannot be reversed.


#Politicians would like people to think that death penalty can solve crime, because implementing it is easy and won't take any serious efforts on their part. What's required is to invest in our under staffed police force.

I’m stuck at an airport and have many hours ahead of me due to a 6 hours delay. I want to open a reclamation on Air India but I’m unable to find the form on their website. There’s no person I could ask since I passed security already. 

If someone can help me would be great!

I’m on the way to your country for the first time and trying to stay positive about this situation. Ranting (moderately) on a form would be nice to kill some time.

So I just started up a couple of months back. I'm not doing terribly in terms of revenue, but I'm running out of money as it's not yet profitable. It's bootstrapped currently. I'm hoping to touch revenue of about 2.5 L by March 31. I obviously know that's not great, but this is in the food tech business and I'm operating in the catering sector where neither Amazon, nor Swiggy have a great presence. I was wondering if I do get to a revenue of say 10L and have a decent number of paying customers, are there decent chances of my startup being acquired?",1575125572.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,4,4

I know  electric guitars can be pretty costly, however I am looking for a bare minimum without much compromise on the sound quality. From my research I found I need 3 things essentially - guitar, amp and effects pedal/processor. 

I want a stratocaster with a whammy bar and to be able to have just all the common sound effects and nothing too fancy (Metal core, classic rock, heavy metal, pink floydish sounds). Since I would only be playing at home, amp needn't be too loud, I figure 2W would be enough? Looking forward I'd also want mics to be able to record stuff. 

I am looking at amazon and strat is available starting from around 9k. There's also a used strat available on OLX. There are amps available from 3.5k and pedals are pretty costly. My budget is topped at 15k. I earlier thought I won't need a pedal and a good amp would have all basic effects I'd need, but seems like it's not the case.

1. Carry pepper spray. Also, please do an emergency drill for using it. 

2. Learn self-defense martial arts. 

3. Carry taser?

4. Always notify someone while traveling alone in cab/auto. Share registration number of vehicle loudly on call.  So that driver knows someone is aware of your whereabouts. 

5. In case you are stranded somewhere if traveling in a car, do lock all the windows and call the police.  In case of 2 wheeler, just ditch it or ride with punctured tire to nearest petrol pump, toll, shop. 

6. Never travel alone in an inebriate state.

331,"The police couldn’t have saved Priyanka Reddy in Hyderabad.The brutal incident in Hyderabad left me devastated. 

There’s a lot of misinformation being spread and a blame game between police and victim going on right now. 

Firstly, the incident happened on the Outer Ring Road that surrounds Hyderabad. It’s 40 kms away from the city. It’s basically like a highway and it’s very hard to patrol every inch. Crimes can easily go unnoticed. 

Secondly, blaming the victim for not calling police is absolutely ridiculous. You never know how terrorised she was at that time and you can never expect victims to calmly call for help in the last minute. The fact that she called her family tells you how women don’t trust or have faith in emergency services in India. The home minister of Telangana insensitively told that she should’ve called police instead of her sister. 
What difference would that have made? That was a highway and there’s no one around to help. 

There were also reports that police initially weren’t helpful when the family approached to lodge a complaint. This is unfortunate and most of the police in India aren’t trained in gender sensitisation. 
Women are afraid and hesitant to approach police and report sexual crimes. 

Predators are everywhere in this country and it’s impossible and impractical to stop crimes. 

The only thing government can do is it fast track the justice process and consistently punish the rapists with capital punishment. 
This will make a big difference and will make these predators think twice before committing a crime. 

We also need a reliable emergency response service that works like swiggy and help reaches you in minutes. This can only be achieved if govt privatises this and invests more money.",1575093190.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,64,173

Nothing has changed since 2012  Nirbhaya rape and few law reforms isn't going to change anything, women are still going to be brutally raped in this country on daily basis because we men don't care enough because it doesn't affect us. From normalizing sexual harassment, misogyny in our homes, schools, workplaces, and treating women as second class citizens of this country in regular daily life, they are going to be raped because we men don't care enough. No just don't say emigrating is a solution. It isn't. Emigrating wouldn't change the fact that India is your country, and millions of women left in the country aren't safe in our homes, offices, can't go outside, because we men don't care enough. No, this is not a comparison, we shouldn't care whether women in USA or Sweden are raped or not. The fact is women in India will continue to get raped because we have never wanted to make this country safe for our women. What is needed is social reform in this country? How low we will fall?

333,"Traffic HellTl;Dr at bottom

So,tonight I decided to start a new mission. I grabbed my helmet, my keys and *vroomed* my scooty into the night hoping to finish it before my mom cooks up dinner. I didn't even have to start my scooty before I saw an idiot speaking on his phone having parked his car in the middle of the road. It was a small street and wouldn't matter where he parked, he probably would've blocked the entire road. Beeped my horn twice and he left, muttering something. Still, I didn't bother much and continued onwards to finish my task. Then on to main road, *et voila!* [Highbeams, I couldn't fucking see](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dvc6a/i_may_go_blind_someday_because_of_these_highbeam/). Ten seconds into my quest and I already started facing my enemies. But again, no worries,I have practised for this. Off I went on my noble steed, twisting and turning, evading and parrying the attacks of stupid hellspawns in the cars, buses, autos, lorries, and countless other machinery they aren't qualified to control. Then came the ultimate wave of evil, bikes. Almost half of the idiots not wearing a helmet and even the ones who wore, untied, defeating their purpose which is to be on your head!

&#x200B;

Couldn't handle the main path, off I went into the side-streets, again hoping to make it back for *hot, hot* dinner. Then came my boss for tonight's quest. A lady in her Vento, which was missing a couple of letters in its name. And in the back seat, her [cambion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambion), dancing like heaven didn't care. I felt that this was wrong, so, I sped up hoping to warn her the ruckus her own brat was causing. I vroomed my stead to the left and blasphemy! Her mirror wasn't open. I slowed down, went  to the right side of the car, hoping my scooty would reach the insane speeds she doing on the small road. Dangerous, but I had to tell her that it wasn't safe for the stupid kid to be flaying his arms and legs about hitting his little sister while doing so. Then through the tinted window I saw his inspiration for such reckless. The mother was using her phone. The little brat had learned not follow rules, not to be safe and to hurt others from his own parent! I sped up, my humble, loyal steed reaching her limits. Fortunately came a blessing, a crossroad. Surely, she had to slow down. But she didn't. 

&#x200B;

The engine *bellowed* through the night, squirting a black mammoth of smoke which I could smell through my helmet. Nasty. I had to get her attention, she wasn't my enemy. No,not yet! She hasn't turned to the dark side. I beeped my mighty horn, it yawping a frail cough through the street. It didn't. It didn't get her attention. I flashed my lights, it too didn't get her attention. I did both, my little thumb struggling to move as fast as a pro-gamer, who is jumping to dodge and parrying attacks. This went on for sometime, me and my steed struggling to keep pace and my thumb desperately trying to get her attention. Then came a reckoning, she stopped. And I spoke for the first time since the start of my quest. ""Don't use your phone"", I said, though it well on deaf ears as her windows were still up. The window *grrrrd* down so I could ask her to right her wrong. Mutiny, I saw, her seatbelt undone. My hope fell, as her darkness grew. Heresy, I heard, when she growled at me, ""*Inna da nenaichutu iruka?!* *^(1)* "". ""Don't use your phone"", I roared through my helmet. ""*Adhellam enaku theiryum, adhukunu horn adichite varuviya? Echa naye!* *^(2)* "". ""Unnoda kunlandai dance aditu irukan,nee phone use panitu ,seatbelt podama vandi otitu iruka, nee mattum inna echa thevidya illaya? ^(3)"". ""Nee poi savvu, adhuku yean unnoda paiyan-num, pon-num kootitu pora? ^(4)"", I attacked. A poisonous strike, which would work moments later. She *grrrrd* her window up in defeat. I had seen her face, wretched and cruel enough to haunt me in my [nightmares](http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-106) for ages to come. *Click,* I heard her seatbelt, through her window, through my helmet. My poison worked. She turned back, *screamed* at her mistakes to not make a sound and they obeyed like slaves to their master. I turned my right indicator on, as my journey was nearing it's completion. I looked as I was turning, her face through my visor, maybe she hasn't fully turned to the darkness I thought. 

&#x200B;

I stopped for my quest with grace, confident from my crowning glory from my side quest. Put my meek, frail steed to rest so I could get what I came for. Having got it, I climbed back, roared my loyal scooty to life. Parried more highbeams with ease, like a *hot* knife through butter. I went inside my home, to the *hot, hot* dinner I had earned for. I had won. Both my quest and a side-quest, helping me level up in this sick game of traffic hell. I have more missions to go. More people to pull out of darkness. Slowly, but steadily, I'll conquer, turning this place into [God's own racetrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrMaCJluFyM), where the roads are clear enough so maybe this time a snake could beat a bullet.

I have always been against the firearm ownership but for last many years watching videos of countless people dying in hands of mob and reading stories about rapes and murders, my opinions about gun control is starting to change. 

I know what I am suggesting here, we don't want to add mass shootings to our list of troubles as a country. But a comprehensive background check and effective mental health screening may circumvent or blunt some of the problems with easy firearms access. But risk will be there.

I feel so dumb when I come by van in the morning since it takes only 2 minutes  and it takes HALF AN HOUR to reach home in the afternoon. I talked to my parents if I could walk home and all I get is a big no. Why ? Because zamaana kharaab hain. Then they tell me about a relative of mine who got surrounded by a group of bikers and all that shit. I have 0 independence. I go to school, come home, eat, sleep,study, sleep again and it goes over and over again. I don't go out because I have to fight for it. I once asked if I could go to a local cafe with my friend. My mother replied,""What if you get held at gunpoint?"" I can't even remember the last time I went out. I just wanna die at this point. My life is an endless loop of the same thing going over and over again. And no one supports me, not my father, my mother or even my brother, in fact he makes things worse. Everything sucks...

UPDATE : So I talked to my parents and nope, nothing happened. I tried talking, nothing worked so I gave up and now I am crying. My brother is talking about getting me a cat or dog and started showing me rape cases here and there, no one seems to realise that none of that will matter if I lose motivation in life. Well, at least I tried. Thanks for your support guys. It made me feel much better than before.",1575051944.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,137,428

So I booked a hotel with Oyo for me and my friends, and Oyo is denying me check in on the basis that my friends are mixed gender(one girl and two boys in a hotel(that explicitly allows couples and nowhere does it say that this combination is prohibited). 
I made my reservation three months ago for 6500, and now they’re asking for 7500 extra for three days for one person for an extra room. 

I’ve been on hold with them for 4 hours now, and the only bit of support I received was when I tweeted at them. Will you please help me by retweeting, if possible from the official randia account? We’re all in Pune rn and everything is booked solid, no chance of getting anything else. 
Thanks

Timeline, if anyone is interested

August 2019: me and several of my friends booked rooms in Oyo 39707 silverkey for 29th nov to 2nd December. We paid for these rooms in advance. 
November 2019
4-5 days before check in, my other friends started getting calls saying their bookings are being shifted(without their approval) to other hotels(way far away from the place we wanted to stay at)
Today, at check in, without being informed of any of this prior, they say they can’t help us check in. 

I spend five hours running from CS rep to CS Rep, and now they’ve told me they’ve solved the problem to the best of their ability(they’ve done nothing, and they told my friend it was okay if she slept on the streets(I don’t have recordings, but Oyo does)

Finally; I get a tweet saying
https://twitter.com/rudrakabir/status/1200322571297669120?s=21

That their team looked into it and provided with the best possible solution, when we haven’t gotten any solution at all. 

Please, please tell us how to proceed if anyone has any ideas.",1575014840.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,13,44

539,"Life eventually catches up with us. I don't know what to do. Please help me!My world has been shaken and taken apart by something I found out 10 days ago. To put things into perspective I'll detail you about me and my family.

 I was born as a single child into a middle class family when both my parents were around 25. My grandparents were really unsupportive, although belonging to high middle class, they didn't support my dad for his education. He completed his engineering from a government college in a small town and tried to set up his business which failed. After a couple of years of struggling and making no money, he eventually came to Delhi to find a job. Me and my mom stayed back in the joint family because my dad wouldn't have been able to put up food for three people in Delhi. 

He worked really hard through the initial years, walking 10kms each day just to save up on money and ate bare minimum just to survive. Grandparents didn't support us other than food so I wore my cousins old clothes and went to a hindi medium school till 3rd grade. My mom was a rock during this time, managing with whatever money dad could send, taking in the taunts and quite unacceptable behaviour from her in-laws, while trying her best to educate me and making sure i did well in college. I was a weak kid falling sick very frequently, she carried me in her arms walking to save up money on transportation. 

My mother fought with my father to upgrade me to the same English medium school which my cousin was attending. Half of their monthly savings were going into my education. With hard work and perseverance my dad slowly started working up the ladder and went from 1500 per month to 15k per month which increased over time as well through the next decade. Around when i was 13 my dad was in a terrible accident, mom decided that we need to shift with him now that we could just about afford to live in Delhi/NCR and dad could also be looked after. We barely made by the next few years living in one room till i was 15. We were able to take loans and were able to buy a 2bhk in old city of Gurgaon. It wasn't great but was a major upgrade for us as a family to have our own home. 

It was around the time when i almost got out of school that our financial situation stabilized and we could go through days without thinking how to survive. In all these years, i was a really good student at school but never an iit calibre grade which i realised soon enough.

I never could take any hobbies, go to tuitions or afford to go out. Getting into college years, i was able to comprehend that we need to grow as a person than just survive. I was able to think and grow, take up things like playing a guitar which i couldn't afford earlier, actually talk to a girl and ask her to a date, watch a movie. I earned a bit of pocket money but most of these things were thanks to by dad and his hard-work. I was finally able to experience the world other than thinking about survival.

After college, i took up a job in my field and was earning around 25k which wasn't much but still i was on my own. I felt like seeing those struggling years i can actually build upon this and give back to my mother and father, for their hard work and sacrifices they made all these years. 

I recently quit my job of almost 3 years to prepare for my masters. This is when my heart broke. Going through my father's phone one day, I realised that he had booked a oyo in the next month in the same city we were in. I was sceptical but tried not to overthink too much about it and thought maybe it was for someone else. This had got me thinking about a pattern where he had gone to a office retreat a few months back and when asked for pictures, he showed one which were taken off a computer screen which i could make out easily. Every night for the past few months, he was out on the roof, with his headphones on pretending to listen to music while walking, but i could hear him sometimes whisper.

This feeling of immense sadness and remorse overtook me but i was intent on finding out what was going on. As the date came closer for which the oyo booking was made, he told mom that he was going for a factory visit in some other city. I hoping to get into the deeper end of it, installed a automatic call recorder on his phone and hid it. After his return from the trip, that night i opened the app an found what shook me. He was with some women who was visiting his from another city. From what it sounded like they had been together for a few 4-5 months, and i could hear them confess their love and commitment to each other. The woman is possibly divorced or a widower, and has two kids. 

My dad has another trip planned next month, and I'm intent on confronting him this Sunday alone. If my mom finds out she'll be broken and considering she has high BP, i dont want to break anything to her before i know everything. My dad was always the sweetest and most patient guy i had ever met, i held him in the highest regard but this has broken me. I sometimes hope this is a bad dream. It could be that the woman could have tapped into the parts of my dad that were vulnerable but he should have known better having a family we're all fought so hard for. 

I'm sacred that after the confrontation, it'll break the family and my mom's health is the highest priority for me. She's done so much for me without asking anything ever for it. But i don't know if i can ever trust dad or that he'll actually leave that woman. We can pressurise him, but what he's already done is despicable, and i dont know what stand to take. I'm torn between what's right and keeping the family together. 

I haven't been in the best of mental health, but I'm trying to pull through. I could really use some constructive advice from you good folks. Only i know of what has happened and no one else. Please help me!

PS, i have a paper next month, i don't know what to do. I haven't studied at all this past month. My whole existence looks like a mistake.",1575021262.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,48,93

I wonder if this is because I'm a ""digital immigrant"" and not a digital native. I remember a time when there was no internet and smartphones everywhere. So I can think about that time and desire to go back there.

But do teenagers who grew up with phones and the internet feel the same way? Or is the screen so intuitive to you that you can't imagine a time without it?

Meanwhile Modi, his partner in crime Amit Shah & co have not said a word about the increasing rate of atrocious crimes against women 

They can wake the president up at 5 AM to impose and cancel presidents rule as they wish.. but cant get the president to pass the order to execute Nirbhaya rapists who are still laughing 10 years after their atrocious crime that shook the world. 

All Modi slogans and rallies are about Nehru, Pakistan, Congress etc while he cant even address the basic problems plaguing the country. They have full majority to create any laws, more power than any coalition govt in the past 2-3 decades, but are doing nothing.",1575015813.0,,Politics,dark,54,69

660,"Guys, I am disappointed in the way we exploit the poor people of India!We see poor people everywhere in this country, sometimes right in front of some extremely rich and posh areas, we see beggars trying to get a meal a day in front of the same malls where we throw away half of the expensive mall food we eat. We move to countryside , same case, thousands of small plots of land that barely feed them, government schools that barely educate them, social welfare policies that are worth billions that won't even cover their most basic of the needs, huts built on millions of tiny plots of land that barely counts as a home, billions in medicine that won't even help curing most common ailments. Enormous quantities of ration that isn't even the fraction of what is needed, all of that because they are born in the wrong place, to the wrong families, in the wrong castes etc.,

It just crushes my heart seeing all this injustice being done, the resources that could be utilized properly, i am extremely disheartened watching all this guys, very very disappointed!

Of such Inefficiency in exploitation!! I mean what the hell are we thinking?? Wasting all that food on these poor people when we can use it for our own amusement! Like we could use it to make a sport where we throw it into a river or something, or just put all that on the ground  and dance on it, maximizing enjoyment factor! All that billions of dollars wasted on social welfare and infrastructure for these people, instead the boring shitshow that is where we have to watch these people slowly starve to death, we could use the same to build thunderdomes and arenas where we make them fight for a fist-full of food, but then kill them anyway! Instead of wasting all this electricity and technology  to apparently ""elevate"" these people, you know what we can do? GIANT MACHINES!! Machines that can use these people as fuel like in matrix, we can just hook these people as soon as they are born in to these machines with a very thick chord that connects them to the machine through their ass. We hook these people upside down inside these giant machines and mine cryptocurrencies from their butts!! Think about it, we can use this butt currency to improve our economy, place bets in the death matches etc!! Our country is going to be a 5 trillion dollar economy in a few months, imagine if only the select few of us could enjoy all of that!! We.. We could be like a self sustaining switzerland backed by ass crypto! 

I mean seriously think about this, it is a much more humane way of living for these people over whatever the shit quality of life they have now!!

Just my two cents!! Join me in supporting for a humane and prosperous India, lets get rid of poverty and illiteracy* by locking up the poor!

663,"Are there people who make big fuss about almost everything? Or have i met a snowflake?So I visit USA for short work trips like 30-40 days on regular basis. Moment I enter USA, I ditch Indian food and go for all American food possible in that time. But recently I was accompanied by my colleague for same work trip. Since it was his first time, I thought he too would be excited for the trip and being out in different country.

Quick background: My colleague is Muslim. So I assumed that he would be comfortable with all American food except that contains pork. Plus, back in India, I don't know him closely as he works in different team. But I know him well as he is there with us for chai breaks and casual stuff.

So first day in USA.

1. He wants all food to be halal meat. Fine. Since Wendy's, Jack in the Box, Taco Bell, Chik-a-Fill, McD, Subway, Pizza Hut can't assure that he goes veg. Bad luck, we are in Texas, good luck finding veg. I ask him how does he do in India, how does he eat all that non-veg in office parties. He says, most of the meat is halal or knows what the source is. Edit: He didn't eat french Fries I offered him because it touched non-Halal chicken I had on my plate.  
I have some Muslim friends whom I asked about this halal thing, that it is difficult in Texas to find halal meat now. Many of these friends I have been with over lunches, dinners and they had never mentioned it. They say that few Muslims follow the halal, but we can't be so specific & demanding or else we'll end up hungry. I have an acquaintance from Egypt, he says finding Halal is not easy in USA, so he prays before eating non-Halal meat. But doesn't if he is in social gathering and has to eat meat. So I assume, though halal is preferred, but it is not that big deal.
2. He enters hotel and finds that tap water tastes like boring well water from India. So I say that yes, but try water from our workplace, if you find it good, you can fill bottles and get it for drinking. So I taking him to store to buy water bottles, but then he goes saying these are normal plastic bottles and unhealthy for health, cancer causing material and other shit. I explain to him that you are here for 30 days, why spend $8-$10 on bottle. Just adjust. I ignored this whole fiasco, I still don't care how he manages water.
3. I asked him to try cold drink here as Coca Cola & Sprite offers multiple flavours and obviously we don't have them in India. Again started lecturing on bad effects of cold drink. Dude, I just wanted you to try it, not drink it everyday. He still hasn't tried the awesome Grape Sprite.
4. Then came the weekend, I took him out to see the city. But started cribbing about prices. Had to explain that you never know when you'll come out of India on company's expense next, enjoy while you are here, don't think about money, it's just one day.
5. Before he came, I asked him to pick universal adapter from Croma as it is most compatible and I have used it so I no it is good. But brought a cheap one and now has to adjust it just so that it stays in plug tightly.

I have never even met such person with so many demands and specifications. there are like 1 or 2 in everyone, but he has like specifications in almost everything. Yes, I understand in matter of money, one can be careful and very specific but c'mon it's your first time outside India. You have to free up a little bit.

I don't know maybe my point of view towards things is different.

Edits: I have read comments so adding few details.

1. Ditch him! already try to spend as much less time as possible. But since company has booked us in same hotel in rooms nearby, can't completely ignore him. Yeah, got him connected with other team members for getting my hands clear out of it.
2. What we work into. We haunt the sewers of USA with clown like makeup & red balloons. We call it IT. Nah, just write bunch of queries and other IT mumbo jumbo.
3. Indian food is tatti in USA. Never ever go to Indian restaurant. Honestly, nothing beats the taste of Indian food cooked by Wife, Mother, Shiv Sagar, Udipi Restaurants and Chinese/Pav Bhaaji/Chaat thelas on Indian road. Indian Restaurants in USA at least in place where I stay try to cater to Americans so they make it less spicy and less salty. It's blasphemy.",1575005782.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,51,102

I'm a young guy in my late 20's and I'm planning to visit India for the first time . I'm mainly going to be staying with my family in Delhi, however I want to venture out to other parts solo.

I've never visited India on my own.

My mom has made it seem like it's a massively dangerous place crawling with thugs and bandits just itching at the chance to take advantage of a susceptible foreigner.

For example, I told her I wanted to see Varanasi while I was there but she said that most religious places are highly commercialised and extremely dangerous. That I would get mugged out in the open if they were able to tell I was a foreigner.

The transportation system doesn't look like it will be my friend either. Trains are unreliable and I'm getting told that it's unlikely that they'll be on time and if I miss a train then I could be stranded in a strange city for however long.

I guess, as a foreigner with little familiarity with the country is there any advice you can give me so I that I can enjoy a safe trip?

I am ethnically Indian, so I definitely look the part and I speak some basic Hindi if that helps at all.

https://preview.redd.it/z54jcs3pdm141.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=eb2acc9ca9c01c9c91cb98bb4721fe1ff648a134

## Tl;dr

Part II of the Recap summarizes arguments made by the petitioners and the government about the constitutional validity of the communication shutdown and movement restrictions in Kashmir under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. The petitioners argued that the restrictions were disproportionate because if the government wanted to prevent the use of fake propaganda to incite violence, it could have adopted less restrictive alternatives such as selectively blocking social media platforms. In response, the government stated that it was impossible to block selective platforms because terrorists would migrate to other platforms or use the dark web for their illegal activities.

## Wait, what is this constitutional legal mumbo jumbo again?

The Indian Constitution grants certain basic rights the status of fundamental rights and empowers any citizen to approach the Supreme Court or High Courts to seek remedy for their violation. These fundamental rights are enumerated in Part III of the Constitution and they include Articles 19 and 21. Article 19 guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression, peaceful assembly, association and free movement subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India, the security of the state and public order. It is also important to note that unless there is a declaration of emergency under Article 352, the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 19 can only be reasonably restricted and they cannot be suspended. Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty, and through judicial precedent, this right has been expansively interpreted to include the right to shelter, healthcare and education. The Indian judiciary has time and again emphasized that the right to life under Article 21 is more than mere animal existence and it includes various rights which are necessary to lead a dignified life.

## National Security. Full Stop?

Before we dive into whether the restrictions in Kashmir are reasonable and proportionate, we must first decide what is the appropriate standard of judicial review in cases where national security concerns are pleaded by the government. On this aspect, the petitioners submitted the Court should not accept the government’s assertion that the restrictions were temporary, need based and periodically reviewed at face value. Instead, the Court must determine if there was sufficient objective material to justify such severe restrictions. The petitioners drew parallels between the government’s arguments in this case and the infamous majority decision in *ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla* to emphasize that fundamental rights cannot be left at the mercy of executive benevolence.

In its response, the government clarified that it was not seeking exclusion of judicial review per se but it submitted that in cases involving national security concerns, the Court cannot function as an appellate authority. Issues involving national security are primarily within the domain of the executive and the Court should exercise restraint in such cases because the executive is best suited to make such decisions by virtue of knowing ground realities and receiving intelligence inputs. Therefore, once the Court is satisfied that a particular case has national security implications, the scope of judicial review is very limited.

## Are the restrictions reasonable and proportionate?

The petitioners argued that restrictions cannot be so severe that they extinguish the right itself. Remember what we said earlier about the government being permitted to suspend fundamental rights under Article 19 only if there is a declaration of emergency under Article 352? That’s extremely important because the Constitution does not envisage a scenario where fundamental rights can be suspended in a “normal” situation. A declaration of emergency under Article 352 would also be subject to scrutiny by the parliament and this is a crucial safeguard. Therefore, by effectively suspending the right to free speech, peaceful assembly and movement in Kashmir without an official declaration of emergency, the government has managed to suspend rights while avoiding parliamentary scrutiny.

The petitioners argued that the restrictions had brought life in Kashmir to a standstill for millions of citizens. Since they could not make phone calls, access the internet or freely move out of their homes, people were unable to visit hospitals, attend school or carry on their business. If the government was concerned about fake propaganda which could incite the masses, it could have restricted access to social media platforms but there was no need to block voice calls and the internet in their entirety. The petitioners produced copies of previous shutdown orders from Bihar and Kashmir as examples of administrative authorities resorting to limited blocking of social media platforms to prevent public disorder. Since there was a less restrictive alternative available in the form of selective blocking of social media platforms, the government’s all encompassing ban on landlines, mobiles and the internet was disproportionate and unreasonable.

The Solicitor General cited statistics about how the restrictions in Kashmir had been gradually eased over the last three months and suggested that this demonstrates that the restrictions were need based and the administrative authorities had applied their mind before imposing them. The government argued that it was impossible to segregate criminals from law abiding citizens, and therefore, it was justified in imposing restrictions on all citizens in the region. The government further submitted that it was not possible to selectively block social media platforms and the only feasible solution was shutting down the internet entirely.

## Is access to the internet a fundamental right under Article 21?

The petitioners explained that in the modern digital India, use of the internet was necessary to access government schemes such as Ayushman Bharat, banking facilities etc. The petitioners cited a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telecom Policy 2012 to support their stance that access to the internet is a fundamental right.

The Solicitor General did not directly address whether the government considered access to the internet to be a fundamental right but he characterized the internet as a dangerous tool capable of misuse. He argued that various cases relied on by the petitioners were not applicable because the standards for newspaper regulation and internet regulation should be different as the internet allows two way communication unlike newspapers. He further stated that social media allowed terrorists to reach a large number of people with minimal effort through the use of hashtags etc. He also raised alarm about the dark web which was encrypted, untraceable and used for illicit activities.

The Constitution of India was drafted decades before the invention of the internet but it is a visionary document which is intended to circumscribe the power of the State over the lives of citizens for centuries to come. Regardless of which side prevails, this case will certainly be a watershed moment in constitutional history about the status of the right to access the internet and what kind of restrictions can be placed on this right.

774,"A few questions about the #MeToo Movement in India.In light of the recent Utsav-Mahima saga, I see many saying 'the movement is larger than the individuals'. And I somewhat agree with that. But then what I wonder is, who do we hold accountable when things go wrong?

Since this movement has been largely active on social media, especially on Twitter, let's talk about that. So from what I could find online, the online account which could be said to be as representing the movement, is the #MeTooIndia account on Twitter. It has over 49k followers, and has the blue tick which says it is a verified account.

But the problem with this account is that it is controlled by only one woman journalist (Rituparna Chatterjee). Though I feel that she has done a decent job to ensure that this account does not reflect her personal biases (the handle put out news articles mentioning Utsav's recent responses, but did not retweet the thread where he had posted all those screenshots, etc.), don't you think it is harmful that one person's perception of right and wrong can establish the entire narrative of the movement? To stick to the current case, Rituparna keeps posting on her personal handle how she still thinks Utsav is in the wrong to post those screenshots without the women's consent, even if they are for defending himself.

**So is this one account run by one woman supposed to represent the views of a movement that affects about 600 million women in this country? And what happens when her personal biases start trickling into the posts of the account that she handles?** I personally think that it was unfair that the MeTooIndia account did not retweet the thread where Utsav presented his defence, and Rituparna's personal handle has defended it by saying it is 'revenge porn'. I'm sure the MeTooIndia handle must have retweeted the screenshots shared by Mahima Kukreja a year ago. The handle hasn't even posted an apology for helping disseminate messages which we now know are full of holes.

**And talking about that, who should be held accountable for sharing such anonymous messages and screenshots that represent only half of the story? Was it Mahima's responsibility to verify them before making them public? Or was it the MeTooIndia handle's responsibility to verify them before sharing them, since Twitter has granted it the authority to be the official voice of the movement? Also, I think it is absurd for Twitter to verify and grant those blue ticks to such an account in the first place. What are your thoughts on this?**

**Also, if none of the above are to be held accountable for such lies, how can people be expected to take the movement seriously?**

By giving outside support to BJP in 2014, NCP established that it - and not SS - were the #2 in MH regardless of who got more seats.

And judging by how quickly Ajit Pawar has been welcomed back into the fold, I'd say there exists cause for suspicion to suggest that this was a planned move as well. And why not? Just like in 2014, NCP has reinforced its position as the MH #2. By revesing position and joining hands with SS it has proven without doubt that on home turf, it is The kingmaker. Its a fantastic position to be in. Ajit Pawar is also talking about spliting CM duties. I dont think its a given just yet, but if it works out, we have both former junior MH coalition partners having their own CMs, thereby rejuvenating their appeal to the marathi voter. 

Why the need tho? Why the need for all this? Because BJP seems ready to snuff out its coalition partners. BJP even went so far as to poach the NDA ally - SAD's sole MLA in Harayana.

So it's my first time going to Goa, let alone sunburn Goa. I have done enough research online about accommodations and travel etc. but would like a few pointers from people with first hand knowledge about the experience. Any help would be greatly appreciated and will be rewarded with a pint of beer (if you're coming for sunburn! ) 

I should mention that I'm going there with my girlfriend.


Firstly, I would like to know about the travel in Goa. For now, we have booked a nice place in candolim as it was cheaper and not as booked out as compared to places near vagator. We have free cancellation till 20th December, in case we come across other options. It is 9kms from vagator and  I  thought I'd rent a scooter and travel up and down on all three days. My other option is public transport, which I have no idea about. Is it possible to get buses or rickshaws back after the event i.e around 11pm ? How safe is it ? 

If it is an issue, we have a less nicer, more expensive option in anjuna, which is 4kms from vagator. 

Secondly, what are the usual rates for scooters around that time ? And how is the cops scene ? I heard that they harass outsiders on rental scooters even if they haven't broken any laws. 

So before I make a decision I wanted to know all the dependencies and open to any suggestions I can get.",1574932740.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,13

936,"Hey Randia, can you please help me out here?I will start from the beginning. My family is lower middle class, and I have been at the receiving end of this financial crisis. I grew up watching my mom always complaining about how we don't have enough money and how my dad is not doing well with his job. As I am the eldest in my family, I took it as my responsibility to be as frugal as possible. I tried limiting all my expenses during my school days and my class mates always teased me for this. I was also limited to my household and never had any interaction with my neighborhood peers.
I still regret it to this day that I didn't had any worldview and was restricted only to Television. 


I took Computer Science as my stream in Higher secondary. I looked forward to becoming a software engineer. I was always interested in animation, gaming, movies. I honestly did a research for my future studies and decided to become an animator. After completing my school, I revealed it to my parents about my decision. But as they didn't have any knowledge about the prospects of being an animator and concerned about a low paying job, they asked / kind of forced me to take up engineering. Honestly, I didn't have any idea about engineering courses at that time and didn't look up as I decided I would go with the flow and be an animator later. 

When the time came to chose the stream, I had immense pressure from my family to take a course with the ""scope"". At that time, IT wasn't booming, so they told me not to take it. I was asked if I was interested in drawing, and so if, you can choose Civil Engineering as it also had ""scope"" to get a job. ( I was naive about architecture, NID, NIFT and other institutes, and I blame all upon me). 

I also had the fear and urgency to help my family financially, so I took up the course which would give me a job after college.
Fast forward , college was over and I was in the real world. I started to apply for jobs as a Site Engineer, but everyone around told me to search a job in UAE, and before that you have to learn AutoCAD. So, I studied AutoCAD and Revit. I was starting to get a grip of the world outside and the regret was starting to boil up in me about not following my passion.

I started to job hunt, and spent half an year to no avail. After that, I got admitted as an intern Site Engineer. I would spend my days at the site with supervisor and with nothing to do and just ""learn everything by watching and gain experience"" kind of thing. Life was starting to become raw and the regret was getting strong. 


I left that job to be a marketing executive at a hardware store. I started designing social media adverts for the company during my stint there. Left that gig when I got employed as a draftsman through my dad's reference and it was also well paying compared to the previous. I was getting worried about my life and my inability to help my family, being dependant on them.

The draftsman job was nothing as I expected. You are just supposed to draw and copy paste according to design by ""engineers"". One thing I learnt from that job was that I never had a future there or anywhere. If I leave the company and start searching for another job based on the draftsman experience, I wouldnt get any and if I, get one, would be a very low paying. Ive seen my colleagues who are in their 50s and 40s, still continuing in that company because they didnt have nowhere else to go. 

I left after an year. Told my dad that I can't continue with this and have to follow my calling. I was lost at first, not knowing what to do and how to start. I decided to get into NID and study animation. But, as I started to learn about animation and design, I got fascinated with Graphic Design. I wanted to be a Graphic Designer. 

Spent an year preparing my portfolio, studying. Hardwork did payoff , got till the interview stage of NID, but maybe I didnt have anything to show as a job experience, got rejected. Got admitted to another school, but I noped out because of the fees and wanting to try NID next time. I started to hunt for job and earn a degree with my money. I cannot put my family through a financial hurdle again.

I've been trying since then and now its and year and havent got employed yet. I did some freelance gigs but couldnt stand on my own.
Still depended on my family and still searching for a job.
My father and family have been forcing/pressurising emotionally about the financial status of the family. They are daily arguing with me to work as a Civil Engineer and earn and support the family.

But I cant repeat it again. My regret has finally taken a toll on me,and now  I really want to follow my passion and ambition. I just want to know what do you guys think about this. Am I doing the right thing? Even if I start working as an engineer again, tbh, my mental health will get worsened. Help me out guys!",1574935912.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,17,42

958,"Is anyone here knowledgeable in Vedic period history, or knows any good english sources to help me out? Hello r/india!

I am looking for information about the warrior culture of the early Indo-Aryans to see how it compares to other Indo-European cultures. Unfortunately I couldn't really find much on the warrior culture of the Vedic period Indo-Aryans , which I chalk up to not knowing where I should look. I am looking to find the answers to some very specific questions, and I am not asking you guys to answer them per se (would be great!), sharing sources or just general information about Vedic warrior culture would already help me a lot. Also I would love to read some of the Vedic passages which talk about the martial history and culture of these ancient Indians, so if you know any, feel free to share them too!

I posted these questions in an r/AskHistorians thread as well but unfortunately I have had no answers yet.

>Do we have any idea how prevalent warriors, or combat was in Indo-Aryan societies of the Vedic period?  
What were the views of Indo-Aryans on battle and war? Was it glorified, or was it seen as a brutal necessity? Are there significant shifts in the perception of battle or the role of the warriors as the Vedic period develops into different eras?  
Was there a concept of 'right of conquest' amongst the Indo-Aryans, similar to other Indo-European cultures such as the Germanic people?  
Which Vedic deities are linked to the martial aspect of Vedic Culture? I am guessing Indra plays a big role, as Indra is a cognate of the various club/thunder wielding Indo-European storm gods such as Perun and Thor, all descendants of the Proto-Indo-European storm god \*Perkwunos. Am I right to assume that Indra was one of the main gods for the warriors of the Indo-Aryan societies? Basically like an 'ideal' version of what a warrior must've been like according to the Indo-Aryans.  
I read that Indra was one of the main gods in the Vedic texts, but that his importance diminished over time and that Indra is not as important in modern Hinduism. If Indra was a god of the warriors, does his diminishing importance reflects on the societal changes of the Indo-Aryans? As time progresses and people become more civilized, the role of the warrior becomes less important and the percentage of people who were warriors would be lower.  
Which passages cover war, battle and conquests done by the Indo-Aryans? Did they fight each other just as much as they would fight the people who they came across? Are there any differences in how Indo-Aryans viewed war against Indo-Aryans and other groups? As in, was it okay to do commit certain acts to Y People but not to Z people?  
What were the burial rites of Indo-Aryan warriors did they differ from the burial rites of non-warriors?  
What were the military strategies of the Indo-Aryans and what was their equipment like? Were any weapons or fighting styles seen as being more noble, like how the sword was a noble weapon in Europe or how the Spartans despised archery?

In case someone here has the answers to these questions and is writing out a long, well written response feel free to share it in the original thread over at r/IndoEuropean because the people over there would also be interested in reading such a response.

961,"Superpower 2020: A Few ThoughtsI am not sure how the phrase Superpower 2020 has turned into a meme - pardon my ignorance on this front. However, with 2020 looming in and popular discourse picking up this phrase for satire, I wanted to reflect upon what it was in its original form - a dream Dr Kalam had for this country.

In his book India 2020 (released in 1998 and targeted at kids, of which I was one then), Dr Kalam tried to put forth major weaknesses and strengths of India, while presenting a vision of how India can emerge as one of the world's top four economic powers by 2020. The whole book is dedicated to a little girl whom he met once. When he asked about her dream, she had told him, ""I want to live in a developed India"".

It is from this place of immense empathy and steadfast belief in the new generation that the idea of India 2020 has come from. I would recommend anyone reading this post to also read the book if they haven't yet. It is not written in the style of some of the best authors out there, but it does show you the honest vision of a single man.

A man who made it possible for India to go from transporting rocket parts on bullock carts to transporting payloads for bigger nations; hell, even daring to land on the moon, all in a span of ~40yrs.

Yes, things are not all right with us, and yes, it seems like we're making progress in the opposite direction. I respect anyone's decision to lose hope in these trying times, as I have come to experience from almost a daily post on Superpower 2020. I, however, will not give up on this country, even though India 2020 might now be India 2050.

It is We the People who make up this nation, and I owe it to the people around me - the ones who have given me food, given me an education, taught me about love, given me a job, offered me protection from violence, built my house, styled my hair, fixed my appendix, allowed me the privilege to challenge a stranger's post online without consequences and the millions of others who have helped me live my life in peace. All this despite multiple instances of me shitting the bed when it matters, my times of horrible cowardice, incessant laziness, rule-breaking, and almost constantly taking things for granted.

I owe this bunch of interconnected lives - this geographical and constitutional boundary we call our nation - at least enough to try and return the favour before I die.

The favour of giving We the People another chance at a good life, in all of my capacity.",1574931567.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,9,8

About a month after this, He went away from home at around 12 noon without telling anyone. No one noticed anything out of place in his behavior the days or even weeks before that. It has been about 2 weeks since he went away. My family members and I have looked at train stations, Bus stations but all we have figured out so far is, He took a bus to Jhansi but since he had no money, The conductor dropped him somewhere along the way between Ranipur and Jhansi.

The local police has not been of any help. We went to file a complaint but all they said was, ""Okay, Give us a photograph. If we find a body, We'll ask you to come and verify"". That's it. They didn't try to look on their own, Didn't ask anyone to look for him, Just nothing. 

I am out of my wits as to what else I can do to find him. His mother(or my Grand mother) is suffering from some issues in her knee and can not walk much. Still, She heard about some People(read babas) who can find him and she has been going by herself to all these places to find him. My mother and I asked her to live with us(we live about 250kms away) but she declined and wants to stay in Ranipur until she finds my maternal uncle.

The wall around the plot isn't even properly built and it fell recently which puts everyone living nearby in danger. I believe the land is probably abandoned. Is there anything we can do about it.

I'm in final year(about to give 7th sem exams) doing B.Tech in CSE from a tier 3 college.

My problem is I don't know where to put my time into.

From the people I have talked to, I know Data Structures, Algorithms and problem solving is a **must** for big companies and if I want to actually succeed in this industry but most of the job description of startups are like some knowledge of popular technologies like Java, Spring Boot, JDBC, Python, Django, React, Angular, Vue, Data  Science, Machine Learning and that too with a requirement of 1 or 2+ years.

I'm overwhelmed by everything! Though I'm already placed in an MNC with <4lpa package through campus placement, I want to get a better paying job as a software developer/engineer.

I have done some *not so fascinating* projects in Python and JavaScript but Idk if I should continue or just say fuck it to all the languages/frameworks etc and just invest my time into HackerRank, CodeChef, Codeforces etc but unfortunately a lot of good companies which ask for DSA problems don't even consider tier 3 grads so learning some stack then becomes kinda important to me. I don't know. 

I think a lot and then don't do shit. Pls tell me what should I do, where should I focus more to get a decent job now. I'll graduate next year.",1574939977.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,12

Surprisingly, cops took cognizance of his complaint  and intervened in the matter.

>'To Meppayyur Station SI

>***Sir***

>***Me  and my younger brother had given our cycle for repair on September 5th.  It hasn't been repaired yet. He took Rs 200 when the cycle was given.  But he does not respond to calls often, if he picks up he will say that  it will be repaired. If we go to the shop it will remain closed. There  isn't anybody else at my home to enquire about this. Sir should  intervene and help us get back our cycle.***

### Tl;dr

Part I of the Recap summarizes the arguments made by the petitioners and the government about statutory compliance of the orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 and Section 144, Cr.P.C. The orders under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 were assailed by the petitioners for lacking application of mind, being issued by an unauthorized official and for not being reviewed by the Review Committee constituted under the Rules. The government defended the orders by emphasizing that they were confirmed by the competent authority under the Rules and it was necessary to shut down communication channels because terrorists use voice and data services to spread fake propaganda and incite masses. The orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. were challenged by the petitioners for being unacceptably vague as they all use the same boilerplate language without mentioning any specific reasons necessitating their issuance.The government responded by urging the Court to not scrutinize the language of the orders too strictly because district magistrates are not legally trained persons. It also referred to various allegedly secessionist speeches made by political leaders in Kashmir which had the potential of inciting public disorder, and it argued that such provocative speeches along with undisclosed intelligence inputs demonstrated the necessity of imposing restrictions under Section 144, Cr.P.C.  


### First let’s get the facts straight

On 5 August 2019, a complete communication shutdown was imposed in the Kashmir valley region of the erstwhile State of Jammu and Kashmir. All landlines, voice calls, SMS services, broadband internet and mobile internet were shutdown in Kashmir. According to the government’s own figures, this complete blackout continued till 17 August when 8365 landline connections were restored out of a total of 43,114 connections. Landlines were completely restored in Kashmir only on 4 September, almost an entire month after the imposition of the communication shutdown. As on date, in Kashmir, landlines are functioning and voice call facilities on postpaid mobile connections have been restored. However, prepaid mobile connections and SMS services (which are essential for receiving One Time Passwords) remain suspended.  


In addition to the communication shutdown, movement restrictions were also imposed in Kashmir on 5 August through orders passed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. While the government claims that the orders passed under Section 144, Cr.P.C. only prohibit public gatherings and not movement of individuals in general, the text of the orders filed by the government suggest otherwise. Don’t believe us? Well, see a sample for yourself.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/aqasixuv8d141.png?width=642&format=png&auto=webp&s=75ef766e02143918eee6e41ee51c920415b3c0b9

According to the government’s affidavit, day time movement restrictions were eased in 35 out of 105 police stations in Kashmir on 17 August and they were completely removed in all 105 police stations only by 27 September, which is almost two months after their initial imposition on 5 August. However, even as on date, there continue to be night time movement restrictions in certain areas.  


### Introducing the Cast

During these hearings, the Supreme Court heard two different petitions. The first petition was filed by Anuradha Bhasin, who is the Executive Director of Kashmir Times and it focused on how the restrictions on communication and movement violated the freedom of the press in Kashmir. The Foundation for Media Professionals, Indian Journalists Union, Tehseen Poonawalla and Soyaib Quereshi also intervened in Anuradha Bhasin’s petition to support press freedom. The second petition was filed by Ghulam Nabi Azad and raised concerns about the impact of the restrictions on the right to healthcare, education and livelihood.  


Anuradha Bhasin was represented by Vrinda Grover and Ghulam Nabi Azad was represented by Kapil Sibal. The intervening journalistic bodies, Foundation for Media Professionals and Indian Journalists Union were represented by Dushyant Dave and Huzefa Ahmadi respectively. The other intervention application filed by Tehseen Poonwalla and Soyaib Quereshi was argued by Meenakshi Arora.   


From the government’s side, the Union of India was represented by Attorney General, KK Venugopal, and the Former State of Jammu and Kashmir was represented by Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta. The Press Council of India also intervened in the matter and while its counsel refused to state which side it was supporting despite being questioned by the judges multiple times, it argued in favour of adopting a weaker version of the proportionality standard which would subject the restrictions in Kashmir to less rigorous review.  


### Are the orders legal?

Before we start, remember that there are two sets of orders issued by the government imposing restrictions in Kashmir. First, there are orders issued under the Telecom Suspension Rules 2017 which are responsible for suspension of landline, voice calls, SMS services, broadband internet and mobile internet in Kashmir. Second, there are orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. imposing restrictions on movement of the public in Kashmir. It should be noted that none of these orders were made publicly available by the government and they were produced during the court proceedings after repeated requests by the petitioners.  


***(i) Orders under Telecom Suspension Rules 2017***

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/csszml9z8d141.png?width=591&format=png&auto=webp&s=6068925358c41eea4a4977310397240b8fcc67b4

The petitioners argued that these orders demonstrate lack of application of mind before suspension of telecom services. For instance, one of the orders states that landlines should be shut down because there is *“apprehension of misuse of data services by anti-national elements.”* Shutting down landlines on this ground is absurd because landlines can only be used for one on one voice calls and they have no relation to data services and the internet. The petitioners further submitted that these orders were invalid because they were issued by the Inspector General of Police who is not authorized under the Rules. It should be noted that while the orders were confirmed by the Home Secretary who is the competent authority under the Rules, the government has not placed on record any document which authorized the Inspector General of Police to issue these orders in the first place. Moreover, despite being repeatedly sought by the petitioners, the government did not place on record any information about whether the orders were reviewed by the Review Committee constituted under the Rules, and if so, what were the findings of the Review Committee. 

The Solicitor General did not specifically address any of these procedural violations in his oral arguments and merely submitted that the orders were confirmed by the Home Secretary who is empowered to suspend telecom services under the Rules. He argued that based on past experiences, it was known that voice and data services were used by terrorists and separatists to incite the masses, and therefore, it was necessary to shut down communication channels.   


***(ii) Orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C.***

The petitioners argued that by restricting the movement of the general public, the orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. made it impossible for residents of Kashmir to access hospitals, schools, markets etc. Further, the orders are unacceptably vague and they all use the same boilerplate language without mentioning any specific reasons necessitating their issuance. On the legal aspects, the petitioners submitted that orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. can be issued only if there is objective material corroborating the government’s subjective threat perception, and the threat to public order or the security of the state must be imminent and genuine.  


The Solicitor General made extensive submissions to justify the orders issued under Section 144, Cr.P.C. He urged the Court to not scrutinize the language of the orders too closely like a statute because they were not issued by legally trained persons. The government submitted that the district magistrate does not have an obligation to state any material facts in the order and it is sufficient if he merely records that there is a law and order situation in the area.

The Solicitor General referred to allegedly provocative and secessionist comments made by political leaders such as Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah which could incite violence and submitted that such comments alongwith other undisclosed intelligence inputs formed the objective basis for issuance of orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C. He argued that Section 144, Cr.P.C. permits the government to take preventive action in anticipation of danger, and therefore, the present restrictions which were intended to prevent incitement of violence and mass mobilization were valid in the facts and circumstances of the case.

Stay tuned for Part II of the Recap which will summarize the arguments made by all parties about whether these restrictions on communication and movement pass constitutional muster under Article 19 and 21.

There are huge funds in Maharashtra government accounts, deposited as part of funds for Bullet train. Centre, Maharashtra and Gujarat control these funds. Sonia wanted to divert these funds for Farmer loan waiver though Japan wouldn't have agreed. But Japan cannot stop Maharashtra CM if he wants to go ahead. That would abort the Bullet train project. It will help Congress to siphon off funds in the name of waivers.

Fadnavis was care taker CM till 22 and he could not have transferred the money to central funds. So he struck a deal with Ajit Pawar (Shah Modi gameplan) and produced letters of support of 159 MLAs through party chiefs. That's why the emergency swearing in. He has transferred almost all the money to central funds, making it impossible for new government to touch the funds.

He will resign now but they have prevented the Congress from poaching into Bullet train project. Sonia's insistence in her CMP was Farmer's loan waivers (the easiest way to scam, like they did in Karnataka and MP) and stop Modi's dream project of Bullet train.

So it was for a cause. Ajit Pawar didn't know all this and thought he can become Deputy CM. In the 3 days, Fadnavis has finished the designated job. Now the Triplets can screw themselves.",1574860428.0,#ea0027,Unverified,light,16,5

What I realize is that, it’s still so easy in this day and age to attract white hippies by a brown guy and make millions out of them all over the world.

This guy stole the yoga techniques from his Guru of Kolkata and copyrighted them as his own and goes around suing people who talk bad about him.

6 rape and sexual assault cases were filed against him of which 4 are settled out of court.

This [documentary](https://www.netflix.com/title/80221584) is a good watch about his journey to stardom and high profile clients and his predatory behavior with young girls.

My neighbors went to some wedding and  left their weeks old puppy out of their house with some milk and stuff. It was crying all evening long. I told my parents I'll bring it home and they said it wasn't our responsibility and that I should leave it alone.

A few minutes ago I heard someone shooing off dogs and screaming and went outside. It was already done. I threw a broom stick from my balcony to fend them off. Went downstairs to get the puppy. 

It was barely breathing. I couldn't see any bite marks so I thought it would live. My father took off it's tie and tried to pour drops of water into it's mouth. I started calling every veternary clinic in Secunderabad area. Not one clinic that mentioned 24 hours service in justdial was open. Finally  some doctor in Picket asked me tro bring the dog. But the puppy stopped breathing. I just left it's carcass in our neighbor's terrace.

I not not saying that you either support or oppose a party. Why can't we have discussion where we talk about what has to be done and not what had been done. For example in most cases BJP supporters and haters are not even ready to have a decent chat. You make a opinion about someone based on his political ideology and don't even listen to his points. You may think that the other is stupid if he can't see things your way and that makes you no different that him. If you really believe what's right then you should have the confidence to have a debate and try to persuade as many people as you can to your side. But if don't put any effort then may be you are not willing enough to make a change. It's sad to see how large the bifurcation is becoming in the country. We can't afford to have that. Blind faith is bad but it is equally bad as blind hatred. We have been given a brain to think and comprehend. Having civility in our lives towards everyone no matter what a person beliefs are is what seperates us and its the least we can do to maintain a healthy atmosphere in this country and not give in to the politics of divide and rule and grow over vote bank politics.

### Tl:dr

As the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 makes it way to Parliament, we showcase some of civil society's work in ensuring India has a well-established data protection framework. It is important that the current concerns with the law be addressed and to achieve this, we provide for a few steps of action that IFF will engage in through its continuing support funnelled through the SaveOurPrivacy campaign.

https://preview.redd.it/8p8jzb2uo7141.png?width=1298&format=png&auto=webp&s=86920a1d5e31dc36c04acef8355a435ee30249a3

### Some background Info

In July 2017, the government of India appointed a Committee of Experts on a Data Protection Framework for India chaired by Justice (Retd.) B.N. Srikrishna. It purpose was study issues related to data protection in India; after which it provided a report which informed the proposed 'comprehensive' law on data protection that now graces us.

This law has been a concern since it was birthed; it not only fails to include a mirade of significant aspects, but some of its content proves to be extremely problematic. It is pertinent that these worries be addressed not only with the intention of furthering privacy and data protection but especially due it being intensely tied to the brink of this fourth industrial revolution we find ourselves in. We have anchored the SaveOurPrivacy campaign that has numerous takes on the Bill, the right to privacy and issues that stem out of it ([Read here for more](https://saveourprivacy.in/coverages)). 

### Our fight for Data Protection

In our continuing work, we will seek to ensure the highest levels of data protection and surveillance reform through this law. Much of this will build off past work which will now provide a solid foundation to contrast the Government's bill with civil society efforts to ensure a synthesis of the best ideas and language in this law. 

1. **Engaging with Parliament:** IFF has been consistently involved in ensuring that data protection finds its rightful place in India and this means it requires an all en-compassing legislative framework. An important chunk of this includes surveillance safeguards; the Bill in its current form makes no mention of this and as need for surveillance reform in India is close to our hearts, we encapsulate this in our work. Almost two years ago, with the help of our generous volunteers, we assisted the office of Dr. Shashi Tharoor, Lok Sabha, MP from Kerala in filing a user centric privacy bill in Parliament. This year, through Dr. Ravikumar Lok Sabha, MP from Tamil Nadu), a substantive redraft of the Indian Privacy Code created by the SaveOurPrivacy campaign was introduced in Parliament as 'Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019'([Read all about it here](https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/personal-data-and-information-privacy-code-bill-2019-introduced-in-the-lok-sabha-today-saveourprivacy)). Both these Bills relied heavily on the 7 Privacy Principles the Indian Privacy Code was based on.
2. **Advocacy with Ministries and Committees:** Throughout the year, IFF has sent a number of representations to various Ministries and the Standing Committee of Information Technology highlighting the need for a data protection law to uphold the individual's right to privacy and especially for transparency in content of the Bill that is to be introduced as law (Read more about it). 
3. **Leading on public awareness:** Be it through our explainers, social media and even events (*remember* [*#PrivacySupreme*](https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/privacysupreme)*, wasn't it fantastic?*), we understand the importance in growing awareness of the need for the protection of one's data.
4. **Litigation:** We hold the clear belief that any Data Protection effort in India will be incomplete without surveillance reform. The reality of protecting the informational privacy of Individuals in India requires both to walk together in lock step together. India cannot protect people from profiling and 360 degree profiles if a data protection law only seeks to regulate the consensual gathering of personal data but does not address and regulate survelliance activities of the State and even private parties. As surveillance reform is clearly important to us, IFF has even approached the Supreme Court on this need as we challenge interception powers of the Government ([Read here for more](https://saveourprivacy.in/blog/supreme-court-issues-notice-on-iffs-petition-for-surveillance-reform-saveourprivacy-1)).

### Continuing efforts

Now that the Government proposes to introduce a Data Protection law in this Session of Parliament, we are concerned that we have become more concerned with the process (*that has brought a degree of impatience*) than the actual substance of the proposals. This is with good reason. It's been a long and ardous wait. However, there is little reason to proceed with haste given the importance of this legislative effort. 

We are today more concerned with the substance of this proposed law, which has yet to be made public since the Srikrishna Committee first proposed it. There exists little transparency on its proposals and the changes which have been made over the course of the year (or, even if not made) are of tremendous concern and mystery. 

With the public left completely in the dark with regard to its content, we intend to take a few measures to ensure concerns with the law are addressed: 

* **Ensure referral:** IFF will examine several options in our advocacy arsenal, to make sure the text of this bill is referred to the Standing Committee considering the lack of transparency and it is publicly unknown. We commit to working in partnership and collaborate with all civil society efforts, academics, experts and collectives. 
* **Persisting engagement:** We will continue to work objectively to advance public interest. Through continued engagement with the Government in any way we can in upholding the right to privacy and the safeguards awarded through the data protection law. 
* **Focus on Individual rights:** We will contiue to fight for you. There is a flood of technologies being used in a manner that violate  individual rights. We will work tirelessly to ensure that each government programme, or private use impacting privacy is rights oriented by making sure dangerous proposals do not see the light of day. 

*We would like to do more, and have further impact! To do this, we need your support in any way possible. One good way to support the #SaveOurPrivacy campaign is to* [*become an IFF member today!*](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/)",1574853638.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,0,10

I laughed hard. 

My parents are renowned scientists who are fools to have stayed here with more than 100 journal publications (real, not fake ones) and over 250 conference talks. 

Guess what. 

The head of the SCIENTIFIC AGENCY is now a Hindi graduate from a private college who qualified UPSC and became an IAS. 

IAS officers are the reason why we have shit governance, absolute lack of accountability in public services and the lal batti culture. I remember being in a school where the IRS dad of a kid used to come with his armed guards to the principal's office if the kid came 2nd i stead of first. 

That kid failed the JEE and the dad sent her to do a bachelor's in the UK which costs ₹1.5 cr at the very least. A senior govt. officials salary then was about ₹10 lakh a year before taxes, so you can figure where the money came from. Oh, that kid used to come in a Toyota Innova with a Lal Batti flashing to school. That dad was a mere IRS mid level officer. Imagine what the IAS babus do. 

No country worth talking about has this crap system where a guy reading Pali or Sanskrit can become a chief of an industrial or scientific department founded by the likes of Vikram Sarabhai or Homi Bhaba. 

If Modi was serious about development, he'd scrap this system and get experts from across industries. Top scientific advisors who are scientists, pollution experts who are actual PhDs in environmental science and HR managers who specialise in industrial dispute resolution for corporates and PSUs, not babus who would fail to get a Peons job in the private sector without their inherited authority. 

Before you say I am jealous of their ""Success"" let me tell you that I don't stay in India now and will try not to. I just hate the fact that lakhs of smart capable people are not able to contribute to basic stuff like waste management and sanitation and education because some lal batti donning babu with a degree in History runs their department by virtue of clearing a shit exam that is based on absolute rote learning (unlike JEE or CAT or NEET).

There were comments calling Indians “street shitters” and “gross and uncivilized” that were getting hundreds of upvotes, and comments that either countered the whole “India has designated shitting streets everywhere” or called out their racism were downvoted to oblivion. 

This is far from the first time I’ve seen this type of behavior from non-Indians(mostly Americans, Brits, Canadians, and Australians) on this site. Almost every thread that has ANY type of content related to either Indians or India(whether it be good or bad) has hundreds of popular comments that spew racist and ignorant things about us and our country.  

I honestly don’t understand why so many people hate us so much? What on Earth did we ever do to them to deserve such crude remarks against us? Truth be told, even though I’ve seen a few people say that Reddit is racist towards blacks, Arabs, and Chinese people, I’ve seen way less racism be tolerated towards them than towards Indians. 

I know some people will say that this is the Internet, and thus I shouldn’t really care much, but the truth is, I haven’t seen seen this much anti-Indian sentiment even on social media apps known for being cancerous such as Twitter, Facebook, and comments for YouTube videos. At least on those places, while some people are jackasses, the majority of people I met were pleasant and respectful to me, whereas on Reddit it seems like anytime anything related to Indians or India comes up, all the comments are straight up xenophobic trash. The irony is that Reddit is actually known as a “liberal” and “progressive” site, yet awful comments towards Indians are constantly tolerated here.

Don't want to spend too much money. Is it worth looking at phones in the 10-20k range? Suggestions?

And hence, whenever somebody says a million it takes me a while to realise they mean 10 lakh and I’ve to keep reminding myself to say a hundred thousand instead of a lakh. 
So how do I go about making this more natural to me? I’ve tried changing my tone of conversation to the international system for this; I’ve also started placing commas in the international standard so my brain gets tricked into finding it more common and hence the standard.

Key Recommendations:  

1)    General Regulation (GRs) have been rationalized and renamed as Motor General Regulation (MGRs) and all pricing related GRs have been deleted.  

2)    The depreciation and Sum Insured calculation has been made simple.

1600,"Indian Constitution Day   
November 26 is celebrated in our nation as the National Law Day or Constitution Day every year as in a ceremony of the adoption of Constitution of India. Exactly 70 years ago on 1949, the Constituent Assembly of India adopted the Constitution of India and it came into effect on January 26,1950 which we celebrate as 'Republic Day'. Everyone will be aware of August 15-Independence Day and mostly January 26-Republic day but only a less will remember,recognize this 'Constitution Day'. As a citizen of India, it's the duty of every Indian to observe and acknowledge this day.

The Govt of India declared November 26 as Constitution Day on November 19,2015. Our current PM Narendra Modi made this declaration on October 2015 while laying the foundation stone of the B.R.Ambedkar's Statue of Equality memorial in Mumbai. Because, B.R.Ambedkar was the one who had chaired the drafting committe of the Constituent Assembly and positioned a pivotal role in drafting the constitution. The constitution was drafted by the Constituent Assembly which had around 300 members. It took almost 3 years to draft the 'Constitution' by holding 11 sessions over a 165-day period.

Dr.B.R.Ambedkar considered the 'Cheif Architect' of our constitution studied the constitutions of about 60 countries and then drafted ours. On November 25,1949 Ambedkar presented the final draft of Indian constitution to Constituent Assembly President Rajendra Prasad. Justice,Liberty,Eqaulity,Fraternity is our preamble.

November 26 was chosen as the National Law Day a.k.a Constitution Day of India to spread the importance of the constitution and to spread thoughts and ideas of Ambedkar.

1608,"Democracy in IndiaBeen a lurker on Reddit for a few days. Had some thoughts so made an account. Hear me out.

India's constitution declares it to be a democracy. But the society and prevalent culture do not. Our culture is heavily influenced by the ideas of respect for the elders and obedience of the young. Those children are idealized who are obedient to the elders no matter what. Even when they become working adults they are supposed to obey what the elders say. This may be a good thing in many cases as they have more life experiences but can be equally bad in many cases too. 

The elders may be anyone - the head of the family, the elder relatives, the pandits/maulvis/religious leaders who interpret religious texts and/or direct rituals, those castes which have interpreted and  enforced the interpretations of religion, OR the political leaders and the government which make decisions on our behalf.

Now the idea of 1 person= 1 vote is supposed to give equal power of choice to anyone regardless of gender, caste, age etc. But there are well built structures of power already in place since millennia which function like 
1 elder person= 10000 votes. And people have validated and continue to validate this unequal distribution of votes/power without any second thought. 

SO my point is as long as people continue to blindly obey the elders(remember the definition of elders from above) in the name of following the culture or simply because of their culturally programmed brains, the idea of 1 person= 1 vote is incompatible with the Indian society.
Even if theoretically, the constitution gives us equal voting power and rights, on the ground and in spirit, this is actually a joke. Look at how our families, public places, temples etc function- if you are not an elder( in that context; like by age, gender, caste etc), you don't have any say in any decision. 

Ongoing example- Maharashtra drama. Every party involved is morally corrupt and rotten to the core. Many people know that what is going on is simply rotten and wrong, but many culturally programmed people who consider the politicians and the government some omnipotent entities/mai-baap(who always know what's good for them), will not question their intentions and even stop others to question them(if necessary by force).

So expect democracy in India to be a lame version of the real thing as long as the respect culture is blindly followed.

TL;DR 
1 person = 1 vote is totally incompatible with the prevalent Indian culture of blindly obeying and following the elders(authorities).

1732,"Did Sharad Pawar, NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena just defeat BJP in the Greatest Game of Political Chess to have been played in India?After weeks of political maneuvering, backstabbing and drama that if it were made into a television series would rival Game of Thrones and House of Cards (and we're not talking about S8 GoT and S6 HoC), it looks like we're finally getting some clarity about what is happening, what has happened and what will happen in Maharashtra.

If you haven't been following, here is what happened:

* The people of Maharashtra voted in the State Elections on 21/10/2019.
* The primary alliances competing in the elections were the NDA (made up of BJP and Shiv Sena) and the UPA (made up of NCP and Congress).
* BJP lost 17 seats and Shiv Sena lost 7 while Congress gained 2 seats and the NCP gained 13.
* BJP got the largest share of votes but no individual party got enough seats to form a majority government (required number of seats to form a government in the Maharashtra Vidhan Sabha is 145).
* After the results were declared, the Shiv Sena refused to form a government with the BJP because their demands for equal share in power and the post of CM for 2.5 years was not met.
* The governor (a member of the BJP and RSS btw), from the 8th to the 11th of November, invited the BJP, then the Shiv Sena and then the NCP to form the government and prove majority.
* After all parties either refused to or failed to prove majority, President's Rule was imposed on 12th November.
* Meanwhile, the Congress, NCP and the Shiv Sena (which has historically opposed and has been opposed by the Congress and NCP and has a vastly different ideology compared to the NCP and the Congress)  entered into an alliance together to form the government.
* Before they could form the government though, Ajit Pawar, nephew of Sharad Pawar and his chosen representative, 'broke away' from the NCP along with a few 'rebel' MLAs and joined hands with the BJP to form the government.
* On 23 November, at 5:36 AM, the governor revoked President's rule and accepted the formation of the BJP-Ajit PAwar government, administering the oath of office to Devendra Fadnavis, who became the CM and entered his second term , and Ajit Pawar, who became Deputy CM. Suspiciously, around this same time, all corruption charges and investigations against Ajit Pawar were dropped.
* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena challenged the formation of this government in the Supreme Court and demanded a floor test. Sharad Pawar publicly disavowed Ajit Pawar and his actions.
* The Supreme Court directed the new government to prove its majority by evening today.
* Today, unable to prove majority, Devendra Fadnavis and Ajit Pawar resigned and the new government was dissolved.

What is happening (as of 19:42 IST) and will happen:

* The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena will form government with Uddhav Thackeray as the CM.
* MLAs from all three parties are in the Trident Hotel rn to elect Uddhav as their CM.
* Ajit Pawar and the 'rebel' MLAs from the NCP are back in the NCP. ~~Ajit Pawar will be Deputy CM~~ (edit: it's still left to be seen what Ajit Pawar's fate is but the process of reconciliation seems to have already started).
* The terms of the power sharing, AFAIK, are still unknown but will most probably be that Shiv Sena and NCP will hold the CM post for 2.5 years each with the Congress will play a supporting role, with all three parties sharing equal power.

(Edit: What follows is speculation from my side but imo it is very probable that this might have happened)

 Now all this might seem like a crazy series of events, but I can't help but feel that all events, after the Shiv Sena entered into an alliance with the NCP and Congress, have been carefully orchestrated by all three parties and especially Sharad Pawar, who I believe has shown Amit Shah that Shah is still a diaper-wearing amateur at a game that Pawar is a veteran of. 

Sharad Pawar and Co have managed to:

* **Split the Sena-BJP alliance:** Although the alliance was always rocky, Pawar and Co have managed to split a natural alliance of the BJP and Shiv Sena that was borne out of a shared Hindutva idealogy, while simultaneously managing to form an alliance with their bitter rivals.
* **Prevent BJP from forming the government:** Now this seems super obvious, but its very impressive considering the fact that BJP netted the most amount of votes in the election.
* **Exposed the hypocrisy of the BJP:** BJP has always run on a platform that stated that their party and government were not corrupt, unlike the opposition who has had multiple huge corruption scandals. It was one of the major reasons why they won in 2014. Now, after the saga with Ajit Pawar (who, lets face it, was never seriously splitting with the NCP, and all this was just a ploy), Sharad Pawar has managed to expose the corrupt nature of the BJP in a very public manner.
* **Saved Ajit Pawar from jail:** This is the cherry on top for Pawar and Co and possibly the most stinging thing to happen to the BJP during this whole saga. Pawar has not just managed to expose the corruption of the BJP but also managed to save his nephew from the consequences of corruption using his enemy as the deliverer/tool of salvation.

Now all this is great and dandy for Pawar, NCP, Shiv Sena and the Congress but what does it mean for us observers and the voters of Maharashtra? Well these are the conclusions I ended up on after this whole saga:

* **DEMOCRACY IS DEAD**: I'm sure all the voters who voted for Shiv Sena because they wanted the BJP in power and all the voters who voted for NCP and Congress because they did not want the Shiv Sena in power are feeling duped, betrayed and angry rn, and they have a very good reason to be. If, ultimately, the choice of a population does not even matter, what point is there to Democracy? What point is there to voting? Might as well choose the next government based on who is better at Jenga or Monopoly - Sharad Pawar, Uddhav Thackeray, Devendra Fadnavis or Balasaheb Thorat.
* **INTEGRITY, IDEOLOGY AND PRINCIPLES DON'T MATTER**: All that matters now is power. Yeah the Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena have managed to defeat the BJP but at what cost? All parties involved have betrayed the core principles and ideas upon which their parties were found by entering into this alliance. Why even have separate parties then? 
* **VOTERS DON'T MATTER:** All 3 parties have betrayed the trust that their voters and supporters placed in them meanwhile the BJP has betrayed the trust that the general public lays on institutions and figures like the Governor who are supposed to be neutral.

Sharad Pawar and Co might have just managed to win the greatest game of political chess to have been played in India but it is the rest of us common folk who have lost. Regardless of which political ideology you believe in or which party you support, I hope you can agree when I say that this entire saga was a dark period for democracy in India.

Edit: We still can't say for sure if this whole Ajit Pawar saga was a carefully constructed ploy or if he actually betrayed (he is know to make rash decisions) Sharad Pawar. He wasn't present at the joint press conference of the parties where Uddhav Thackeray was announced as the CM and some NCP members asked Sharad Pawar to ensure that Ajit Pawar is back in the fold asap. So it's still unclear but I can definitely say for sure that whether this was by intention or not, it has only helped the NCP-Shiv Sena-Congress alliance.",1574779904.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,125,837
1733,"Explainer : Why Stock Market looks like it is going up while the economy is going down.This is based on a reply I gave in this thread : 

https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e1shrw/how_is_stock_market_doing_well_despite_bad/

I am pasting what I posted there. 

*******


There are three things you need to know before you make a conclusion.

    How Indices work.
    Big Institutional Investor and Retail Investors.
    The New GDP formula.

1 - How Indices Work : I hope everyone knows how stock market works. There is a piece of the pie of a company called a share that people bid to acquire. It runs on the sentiments based on what one thinks would be the price of the company in the future. Now, there are multiple stock markets where these shares are sold. Two big ones in India are BSE and NSE (Sensex and Nifty). Think of the standard 12th exam. You have overall aggregate score and then there is PCM/PCB scores. In case of Indices, there is the overall money that is in the market and there is the top 30 stocks. So, to get a number for Sensex or Nifty, there are 30 stocks that the Index has chosen which tells you the number. Right now, top 30 stocks are giving 40K+ for Sensex and 12K+ for Nifty. So the Indices are choosing PCM score to determine the numbers. That is like one fails in other subjects but scores solid numbers in PCM. Indirectly, you have still failed the exams but you tell the world your PCM scores and everyone thinks you are done well in the exam. Getting my drift here?

2 - Big Institutional Investor and Retail Investor : Another thing to note is how the rules are different if you are an Individual investor (like me and you) or if you are a big player like Mutual funds, large company, brokers, Investor pools, etc. In most cases, the Retail investors can't move the market unless they turn up in huge numbers which they usually do when there is news in the market for a specific stock. This news is usually stale and the Big players already take their positions. That's a different story for another day.

3 - New GDP formula : Earlier GDP used to be about the productivity of the industry. There would be a solid random 'sample' of various Industrial, Agricultural and Services output that the government would take into account to give the numbers. However, this current government start failing very quickly as they were incompetent. Hence, they decided to change the numbers to suit their propaganda. But! Something worse happened to this formula, the numbers from the previous government started looking unprecedentedly stellar (13% for 2010/11 🤣) which made the new numbers look puny. So they revisited the formula till could show the MMS government was bad. To do this, they started including Stock Market numbers and as we know these stock market numbers are like PCM scores, they give you a sense of victory. It simply accounts the growth of the market as one of the indicators for GDP which I feel is extremely wrong as stock markets can be easily manipulated.

Now, lets put this together. The government fucked up big time with growth. In fact, my friends who work on these numbers point out that currently, we might be growing at 2% while the new formula might show it to be 5% on 29th November 2019. So to get these numbers the government must make sure that Indices hit good growth which they are and we know that they only consider top 30 stocks. To move the index in the right direction all you need to do is to make sure that these 30 stocks can be manipulated and which the government does through big players. Some of the big players in there are run by the government. Entities like LIC, UTI, PSUs keep buying and selling stocks to keep a balanced growth. That is why we have such crazy numbers. Currently, top 30 stocks have 80% of all the money in the market which used to be 20% in 2014!

This is why you see the 'Stock Market' going but the economy is going down.

I'm writing here because I'm currently planning my second visit to India in 2020. I fell in love with the country back in 2016 and have been dreaming of going back there ever since. One of my big goals for the visit is to study on a yoga course (I've practiced for about 7 years on and off, mostly Ashtanga and Hatha), but I am beginning to feel very disheartened. I began searching online to find a school in Rishikesh and narrow down my options, however it seemed almost impossible as there are numerous schools with what seem to be incredibly high prices, because they accord to the 'yoga alliance USA' standards of 200 / 300 hour certificates. These courses come at no less than 1000 EU!! I am not living in USA so I really do not care for these standards, it seems unnecessary. I spoke to an Indian friend of mine (he's now living in Europe) and he advised me not to give my money to these schools which are simply a capitalist enterprise, especially when I am seeking knowledge that is not westernised or watered down for a Western audience. Basically, I was wondering if somebody here could advise me, because these figures seem crazy to me.  Yoga is a business, of course, however it seems that it is almost impossible to find a yoga course for less than 1000 EU / £ for 4 weeks/ 600 for 2 weeks.  In contrast to this, I'm atending a  Tibetan Buddhism course in McLeod Ganj for 10 days which is run on a donation basis. My indian friend says that reputable yoga schools will offer similar programmes, however it seems almost impossible to find these - after all, I'm sure many western tourists seeks that, supply and demand etc., but surely there must be some ashrams (possibly beyond the reach of Google) where I can study authentically without sacrificing such a huge amount of money? Thanks so much guys, any advice or knowledge is appreciated.

A while ago I had posted asking for any suggestions on what to do, as me and my brothers were kicked out of our house. 

A lot of people replied with offers of employment, accommodation, words of support, and even monetary help. While we did not take any help, I would like to thank everyone who did, it meant a lot to me. It was a trying time for us and we are thankful to everyone who chimed in with whatever they had to offer. I received a barrage of support from people who were essentially strangers, and it gave me a lot of courage to keep moving forward. I would like to mention u/subvolatile, u/swami_rara, u/RBCWBC, u/Slowu, u/Vishrit, u/_ne0h_, u/shash747, u/br0cket, u/cloudy_sky12, u/earthlover7, u/pandemonichyperblast, u/brownlust, u/bruin47, u/aaredmi and everyone who sent me a pm or commented on the post. 

We were homeless for  3 days, my mother sent some money and we stayed at a hostel for days. Some relatives helped us out and we paid the outstanding rent. I started going for interviews and I got a job, I start next week. I have cleared a round for another job, but have not yet received an offer letter so I am waiting it out.   


While things are going somewhat okay, my vision for the future is still somewhat dim; I will have to quit my masters program to start working and I am still unable to reconcile with that fact. My mother and grandmother insist that I study further, even though my mother's salary is only enough to pay a months rent. They say that God will help us out. Either way, I am also asking for advice here - Will I be able to have a good career trajectory as a Content Writer? What skills do I need to work on? I got a lot of job offers, but they were mostly entry level and I will not be able to sustain my family with that income. How much longer would I have to work to earn enough to lead at least a middle class life?. The other alternative is to continue my masters course in Clinical Psychology. My uncle has agreed to pay the fees, but I will have to look for any other money on my own. The travelling alone costs a lot of money, and I don't know how if I will get a well paying job after my masters. My college does not offer placements. Any advice is appreciated.

TLDR :

1. Contrary to the Indian nationalist myth, British rule was not exceptionally harsh nor did it impoverish the people. Britain did not industrialise because of Indian capital and it was already richer than India.
2. India had always been a highly unequal society where the vast majority of people were subsistence farmers. Mughal taxation was not less, and likely more, oppressive.

Edit:

Adding from comments:   
Yes I understand you anger and outrage, this things are nothing new. Every nation states have been doing it for  over centuries, Germany, Cuba, Russia, America, Japan, China everyone are doing it, Including India Congress did it now BJP is doing it. And this proganda machines are far more complex than, what you see on the surface. All the news networks are owned by the 1-2 individuals, including all the librals, did you know Lallantop (the so called libral internet news) owned by India today the same group that owns Aaj Tak. Another surprise Mr. Antilia  could be owning [50% stake in NDTV](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/who-really-owns-ndtv/article24323637.ece). If you want to know how this state operated machinery works search the history of  **Hiroo Onoda** a japanese soilder during WW2.  


>Question is, how do you make the general voter care enough to look beyond what is readily shown to him on tv and actually search for facts and demand answers from the government.

I am sorry but I doesn't matter how much aware is the general voter,as you are seeing in MH, how they are doing whatever they want. I can give 100s of this kind of political examples, happening since the independence.

After a few hours prices decreased by 10000 for the flights in May. So we tried to cancel and get full refund as it wasn't 24 hours yet. When we tried to cancel from the website, it showed that we would be getting negative refund. My mom thought to cancel via customer care. She has been calling till the 24 hrs passed but it has been an endless chain of representatives with no one even trying to solve the issue. On my side the music plays for 2 minutes and then infinite silence. No response at all.
 
Side note: This May I traveled to India during my vacation and booked Air India Flight. I had a 12 hr delay at both arrival and departure. I also had one of my bags delayed. I was never going to book by Air India again but it was the most convenient for my mom as our city airport has only that flight. So I gave in. 

HOW SCUMMY AND WEASLY DO THESE FOLK AT AIR INDIA HAVE TO BE TO NOT EVEN CANCEL AND REFUND A TICKET? ARE YOU THAT WORRIED OF YOUR BOTTOM LINE. WELL YOU WON'T HAVE ANY CUSTOMERS FOR THAT BOTTOM LINE ANYWAY.

okay guys! brace yourselves, this is going to be a long one! most of you who know me through my virtual persona only know me as someone who has got a sense of humor and someone who keeps bombarding us with songs/parodies, which after we come across 5-6, we see one video. but today you are going to witness some outrage, anger and seriousness.

so a voice of reason possessed me yesterday at 11 pm and went on a polemic for 30 mins, this is the crux of it all, it's called - ' a snapshot of our nation', the words that follow are of the voice of reason, don't attribute it to me, it is hella provocative, it's filled with facts and some speculation to explain what is happening in INDIA, and what the government is doing, to an alien who knows nothing about the country-

so ever since i was a kid i have had the notion that i don't want to talk about politics ever. cause it's what adults talk about, its boring and all politicians are assholes. a notion that i held up until very recently, but i don't live in an isolation tank and we creative people don't live in the belly of a whale (salman rushdie/george orwell reference just for me). and the issue i am going to raise today is not just political.

i am going to use my private education and the privileged upper middle class upbringing i have had to talk about education and yes the JNU protests.

when i applied for master's i got through one of the best 25 mba institutes in the country and in TISS in social work. and i regretted my impulsive decision to pick TISS because i could have had a 12 lac package per annum and a comfortable life after completing my MBA, well not anymore, i never think about that now

coming to TISS enriched my soul! made me more humane, fueled my creativity and probably made me a better artist/writer.  
you know why? because of the representation from every nook and corner of the country, because of people coming in from varied economical backgrounds.

my parents have always complained that ever since you started going to school , you have declared everyone in school, even in engineering college an idiot, a self-absorbed , entitled, uninteresting idiot. well, not in so many words, we have a delicious word for such people in hindi, i am sure you are aware of it..take a second, enunciate it in your head, chuckle, cause you are not going to be given an opportunity later. but why did i do that ? because i knew i was an idiot too and they were all like me. but why? private schools, private colleges, homogeneous middle class backgrounds , homogeneous middle class problems.....boring, saturation!

people outraging against the JNU students, you don't realize, they are fighting for you! it's not about only the hostel fee hike of JNU , it's about subsidized education, it's about government expenditure on education, it's about the laughable proportion of gdp allocated to education in this country. you know what else this is about. ITS ABOUT KILLING SOCIAL CHANGE IN THE CRADLE! ITS ABOUT NIPPING DISSENT IN A DEMOCRACY IN THE BUD! and you should be furious!

we spend around 3 percent of our gdp on education and countries like bhutan spend about 7 percent. we are behind other countries like kenya, malaysia,korea,usa,etc. we are underspending on the allocated funds on education and about 50% of that fund on engineering institutes and iims.( source: deshbhakt youtube)

now, why are we spending more on engineering institutes and iim's? glad you asked.

cause that is generating a cheap labour force for IT companies and electronic companies and automobile companies that outsource, or they are called to those respective countries. we were the highest remittance receiving country in 2016, but does this contribute to the gdp? only if it is in circulation! is it? go check yourself!

so if people from social sciences backgrounds form labour unions, and fight for rights and minimum pay, off goes the capitalist to another impoverished country, people become unemployed, more outrage!

do you even know how many courses JNU has? how are they contributing to the economy. please check out their courses cause i know a hell lot of people mindlessly doing engineering (not all of them off-course) but a huge proportion. please do something else!

newsflash: the government doesn't want more initiatives to come in place to alleviate poverty, marginalised sections, the oppressed, because a capitalist economy rewards capitalist ideas!

i mean come on the biggest issue in the political sphere for 2 decades has been RAM MANDIR? are you fucking kidding me? i don't have a problem with religion, i respect all of them. we are a secular nation, i respect the constitution. but what about unemployment, poverty, women's movement, displacement, indigenous people, violence!?! i mean it's idol worship, you can do it at home, it's something personal! why is this in the political sphere? bhagvan ram spent 14 years in the forest, shouldn't we rally for a temple in the forest too?

and what's this thing about nationalism, and patriotism! if you have to force it down my throat isn't the whole meaning of patriotism and nationalism ironic! be a decent human being first. i am too exhausted to even explain how kashmir was a territorial issue and you couldn't care less about the people. you are just as barbaric as the mughal invaders!

\- demonitisation- 99% of the money back in circulation!

because i am a creative person, i don't just see rage. i see beneath the surface of the jnu students, i see their sense of indignation, i see their vulnerability. and i respect them. and i feel for them. MORE POWER TO YOU GUYS!

govt., you messed with the wrong demographic! MOBILISE! FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHT!

and people if you let this go, it's going sting you years later when you won't be able to fathom why education prices are sky-rocketing! you let loose now and it's going to happen to all institutions. privatization is coming for you!

okay, i am going to leave this body now!

phew! that was heavy man. this is going to contribute to the outrage porn in this country! but essentially we are going nowhere ! do something! question your government!

Apparently, he has told a relative of ours that ""Maine thodi choda hai, aana hai to aa jaye"" (meaning: I haven't left her, she can come if she wants to). In no condition is she going back (that's her decision as well). He plans on dragging the case as much as possible so that my sister loses time and he has to not pay any money back.

How feasible is this? I also want to understand a thing or two about our lawyer:

1. We have filed the case in Noida, and he is from WB.

2. The case was filed more than a year back.

3. Till date, he has not appeared in the court, despite us filing many cases against him (dowry, beating, etc). He has sent his own lawyer twice or thrice. He say things like mother is sick etc.

4. Our own lawyer took around Rs. 60k from us to bribe the judge to fasten the process. Normally, they give date that are more than one month apart. And more often than not, that day will be a strike.

5. What will the court do normally when he pretends that he is ready to live with her? My sister has a job and all now and absolutely does not want to spend a minute with him. Will it affect the process in any way?

How should be plan our battle now? I am in no hurry and want to see him in jail and want my money back. Any recommendations for a lawyer around Delhi area would be appreciated.

These new copiers are earning much more than people that they stole from. Some of the victims are small artists and not as popular as them.

The music industry is losing the originality. It just seems to run after money and YouTube Hits.It just seems like every month there's a new song that they have copied and released ""their"" version. 

I am sick of my favorite 90s songs being ruined.

Edit: to all the people who are saying its under license, as a consumer it doesn't matter to me. What i mean is a lot of them are not making new content and still getting hella famous. Copying is still copying in the creative sense( not legal sense).",1574744625.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,95,271

She wanted to book a gurudwara so googled up the website and called the number. Guy on the phone told her that only online booking via Google Pay is done. He sent her a link to a Google form to fill and asked for a token amount of 5 rupees. The lady claims the form never asked for any details such as account number, OTP etc. Looked like just another Google form. The guy asked her to stay on hold, meanwhile slowly withdrawing upto 1 lakh.

Apparently her whole phone was cloned in the short time she was on call.

While UPI scam is on the rise, I am just wondering how legit is this story? Is it possible to clone your phone with most insignificant details from our side?",1574745395.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,28,46

1990,"Who are these famous semi-anonymous Twitteratis who post tweets on Indian politics day and night and are so famous?I have started using Twitter a few months ago and I usually follow political stuff. I have observed that in all sides of the political spectrum, there are some famous Twitteratis who don't really reveal themselves, and post about politics almost all day. Some examples are Chirpy Says, Advaid, Nehr\_Who from the 'left' (even though left-right dichotomy isn't really clear cut) and people like Anshul Saxena, True Indology, History of India, etc from the 'right'. Nothing much can be found about them from the internet other than that they are Twitter 'celebs'. It seems as if these people don't really have much work to do other than post on Twitter and rant about 'leftists' and 'rightists'. 

Who exactly are these people? Do they get paid for what they write? If they do, who pays them? I don't think any political party pay them. But their sources seem shady, their posting all day seems shady, the fact that they are semi-anonymous is shady. I am really curious about them. I won't say that they are not devoted to politics or that they only write those because they  have attachment to certain politicians, but given that they regularly post so much on almost everything the 'other' part of political spectrum says, gives the impression that Twitter is an income source for them.",1574705697.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,6

I added the products to cart and went to payment. Since i did not want it to show up on my card history, i payed by Paytm. The transaction went through and the money was debited from my Paytm wallet. 

However i did not receive any message or tracking number them. I figured i will get the mail in a bit.
Nothing.
I contacted Paytm the next day and they asked for proof that the vendor is refusing to deliver.(I have no transaction details or order number except paytm order id.
I called the logistics company and they said without the airway bill number they cannot track it
I wrote to Durex and received a reply saying they will get back to me.
I dropped a reminder mail, And another and another.
They have stopped replying to old mails on the same thread and new mails as well. 

I called up Reckkit benkiser too and they said that Durex brand is handled by an altogether seperate team and they do not have a contact number. They told me the same problem has been recieved by them from several people across the call centre and there is some system issue with the website(However they wouldn't help or file a complaint)

My father had a rough childhood. He experienced a lot of suffering at a young age. That hardened him. It left some ineffaceable impressions. Sadness due to his suffering leaked into his personal life. My parents were rarely happy together. They chose to seperate.

I'm in my 20s but live with my mother. My father is often lonely, hopeless and urges me to live with him. But we were never particularly close. I do everything I can to make him comfortable. I spend at least a couple days with him in a week. But beyond that I find it draining. 

Our conversations are unenlightening and he often bemoans his fate. Am I wrong?
I often experience guilt for not doing enough for him. He often sought my support to save his marriage. But i didn't play an active role. Now i dont live with him. He's unhappy and yet again I'm ashamed for not doing enough.",1574654941.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,50

Meanwhile, realised I had a knack for writing and decided to quit the BPO life and change my field entirely. Jumped to content and copy writing. I’ll be honest, I was overwhelmed and under confident about my own skills. Being a fresher was not something I was used to. But the place I joined 6 months ago as a content writer has good people and mentors with the occasional tensions and politics. I have been told by multiple people here that I write well for a fresher and am upto the industry standards. Now I am slowly getting the hang of the skills and the feel of it. It’s been 6 months and I am really interested in expanding my skill set. Since this is a medium sized digital team, I have some free time that I want to utilize apart from browsing reddit. From where I can see, there are two things that I can and want to learn. One is designing, but I understand that will take a lot of time, patience and PRACTICE. The other is SEO/SEM, I understand learning SEO will help me write better content and is a better choice overall. What will be a better skill set for a content/copy writer to learn/acquire? Also please suggest some starter pack guidelines for either/both so that I can refer and start learning. Any and all help is appreciated. Thanks.",1574672224.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,2,9

For thirteen years I studied in the same school and got told the above mentioned things every single day from 7:40 am to 2:00 pm. My surname is Basu. They mocked me by changing my surname to basura, basure, bachhuchhu. It had become a favourite hobby of theirs to mock me and humiliate me because of my dark skin tone and poverty. They derived some sort of pleasure by constantly belittling me and psychologically bullying me. I remember once I had had a fight with one of my classmates and all the stationery on my desk had gotten scattered all over the floor. My desk too was lying on it's side in a corner somewhere. So after the fight got over I started picking up my stuff. One guy commented, ""See. This is what his parents teach him. Whatever he sees lying on the floor/streets he just picks it up. Such a rag picking begger."" 

They used to throw bits of their lunch in front of me like you throw treats in front of a dog and laugh out loud at me amongst themselves after doing so. I was literally a ragdoll or a punching bag for the entire school. My school had a canteen too. Although mine was a private school but kids in my school behaved like government school kids when it came to buying something from the canteen. The canteen looked like a beehive during lunch time. Anyways, one day immediately after reaching the counter I felt as if somebody is pulling me away from the countertop. I turned around and saw it was one of the class 11 goons. (You know.... every school has that gang of senior students that every other student fears. They come from rich families. Most of them are an asset for the school as they play for school's football team. No actions are taken against them even if complaints are made.) I felt my rights were being snatched from me. It was my turn. Anybody else should wait for their turn. You can't just drag or remove some one from the counter unless he has made his order. So I protested. While I was having a verbal spat with him, I felt a sharp blow to the top of my head. Somebody had attacked me from behind. It was one of his friends. Within 2-3 seconds a lot of blows and slaps had landed on my face and head from any and every direction. I was quivering and crying. While getting beaten up I had completely frozen. I couldn't even lift a hand or fight back. The first blow itself on my head was so hard and sharp that for a moment I felt I was gonna faint. I felt so utterly humiliated getting beaten up in front of the entire school. All including the girls were sneering at me and the whole school had enjoyed the spectacle of me getting beaten up. Had other students from the same class as that of those senior bullies not interfered, I surely would have gotten hospitalised. I had become a complete joke ever since that day. Earlier only my classmates were calling me derogatory names. Now everyone in school irrespective of whether he/she was senior or junior to me, was making fun of me. I was in class 9 back then.

I was the only kid in my school perhaps whose parents didn't own land, house or any property at all. Both my parents are from West Bengal and come from humble backgrounds. My father had come to delhi looking for a job when he was eighteen. Maybe it's his fault that he couldn't make a house of his own even after spending 20 years in a place like Delhi alone. After spending 20 years in Delhi, he married my mother. They must have spent two years in Kolkata but after I was born, father decided to shift back to Delhi as he always saw Delhi as a land of opportunities that West Bengal could never be. Throughout my life I have always lived in rented accommodations and travelled in sleeper class trains. The reason I am mentioning this is because I want you all to know where I come from. All those other kids in school came from affluent families. They lived in apartments, societies, bungalows.  

Whatever my father used to earn was barely enough to make ends meet. After paying my school fees, house rent, bills and grocery hardly any savings were ever possible. I don't know why he kept sending me to that school for thirteen years in spite of me complaining about it innumerable times to him. Maybe he felt passing out of such a big school meant a brighter future than his. Had he sent me to a less expensive school a lot of money could have been saved. And maybe it's my fault that I didn't study well. Actually from prep to class 10, I had always gotten 98-100 % in only two subjects. Science and mathematics. In all the other subjects I used to just barely pass. My secretly jealous relatives who acted like they cared for me, parents, neighbors.... everyone thought I was surely gonna get into some IIT. But I got an AIR of over four lakhs in AIEEE. Let's not even talk about JEE. I looked into my parents' eyes and saw how all their dreams had shattered completely. They were so sad, angry and lost. All their hopes gone in an instant. Fate had given me a second chance in the form of a newly opened third tier college's administration dialling my father up. My class 12 board results were so different from my class 10 board results. No DU/JNU/IP college was gonna enroll me. And other private engineering colleges too were asking for hefty donations. This newly opened private college which didn't even have a proper hostel was willing to admit me without any donations. All I had to do was study, give GATE/IES/CGL exams or at least finish my b-tech degree with good percentage and find a job. But I took 7 years to complete my degree instead of 4. Two months from now I will sit for GATE. I have no idea about what I am gonna do. Both my parents are falling sick and have gotten so old and weary. I keep blaming my school life bullies for turning me into such a psychologically damaged loser. I know many are gonna say that it's my fault. My fault that I didn't study and get a good job. But I want you to put yourself in my shoes. You spend your entire childhood in complete isolation. No friends, siblings, cousins or relatives to look up to or share your emotions/feelings with. I think anybody else in my position would have either committed suicide or done something wrong like taking drugs/killing his bullies/committing crime, murder in a fit of rage. Parents never really gave a shit about my issues either. They always pointed out my faults and quipped, ""how come out of all the kids in school you are the only one that everyone likes to pick on?"" They just asked me to ignore them and focus on my studies. Well it's not that easy. You can't focus on studies like this. I used to think about burning the whole school up by messing with the generator or leaking the fuel from school busses. The only thought that kept going on in my head was how I could just kill them all. 

As of now I am a 25 year old jobless loser who is just a burden on his dying parents. My father is nothing short of my school bullies either. He is like a dementor from harry potter series. It isn't that only now he has started being stingy, mean and bitter. He has always been like that since my childhood. Beating me for accidentally shaking his chair while he was watching news on TV (I was 8-9 years old back then), asking him to pass on something (anything), etc etc. I remember once my school authorities had complained to him about me having fights. (The school administration was well aware of my bullying issue but still always took action against me only after a fight) So after coming home from office he just started beating me and kept asking me if I enjoyed being their (the bullies) bitch.",1574677928.0,#5a74cc,Moderated,light,72,214

# Brewing a storm

post election results the BJP had the plurality (had the largest number of seats) but lacked the majority to form a stable government. ([Results](http://www.elections.in/maharashtra/)). Now Shiv Sena wanted something in return for supporting a BJP government. The lollipop to be given in this case was the CM seat of the state. Shiv Sena asked for a sharing arrangement where their candidate would be CM for half of the tenure and BJP for the other half. BJP did not like this and gridlock.

&#x200B;

# Tripartite Alliance

In accordance with plurality the governor of the state invited BJP. BJP told the governor that they won't be able to form government. BJP was given 48 hours for this. Next came Shiv Sena.They were given 24hrs to prove majority. They said that they could prove majority support and asked for more time to prepare a letter of support (an official document that shows whether MPs actually support them or not). Governor refused to acknowledge their request and moved to next party aka NCP. They too were given 24 hours to prove ... But before 24hrs had passed president's rule was imposed in Maharashtra.

In order to keep BJP out of power SS, NCP and INC started discussing the possibilities of an alliance. The tripartite pact reached some kind of agreement and were ready to announce it next day.

# Conspiracy Zone

Skip this section if you want only concrete info.

So in the tripartite arrangement, possibly Ajit Pawar was excluded from power or given some rather menial charge. So either someone ambitious from BJP got wind of this or Ajit Pawar thought he might be able to get a better deal from BJP. So he meets BJP bigwigs, makes a deal with BJP in the wee hours of the night and next morning by 8:10AM he is sworn in as Dy CM along with Devendra Fadnavis as CM (to the dismay of several newspaper publishers). 

&#x200B;

# While the (political) world sleeps

Ajit Pawar and BJP strike a power sharing deal. Ajit Pawar manages to get a bunch of signatures from fellow MLAs cos he's rather big in NCP and somehow manages to provide the governor with a letter of support. This very much surprises the Nation (newspaper publishers most of all), and makes the Tripartite alliance very very angry.

So angry that in-fact this is challenged in Supreme court. And this brings us to today. When SC has in typical Indian fashion told us that kal karenge (i.e. we will have a look at it tomorrow)",1574679421.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,11,2

**A man just got away with 70,000 crore of our and our family’s money**. If even 10% of that money was distributed to unique 200 crore savings bank accounts, every account would get **35(!!)cr**. I think we’ve become numb to the scale of corruption and have become supremely apathetic to the affairs of our country. 

I say we need to wake up and protest. I know we all have our lives to live, work, office, studies and deadlines but we need to be plucky for maybe one day and say, We are here and we are watching you and this will not fly. Will it change anything? I can’t say definitively that it will, but these leaders need to know that they can’t brazenly be corrupt and expect us to take it lying down. We’re looking at ethical standards being dropped at an all time low. 

So **please** guys, let’s band together and organise a protest. States which have elections coming up become supremely important for protests. We can organise reddit meet-ups, and get togethers, and I’m not expecting a 1000 people protest at all, but we all need to take some initiative here. It’s our country for gods sake.

If any threads are required, I’d say mods take a lead on this and create threads for all the places that wish to protest. We will need organisers of the protest who can decide the place and time of protests. Ideally the mods should supervise the entire process since they have some semblance of authority here. We’d need people who’ve organised protests before to be heavily involved as well. **I’m not asking you guys to give up an entire week of your lives to protest, just an hour or two, any day from your entire life **. I will be contacting the local office of the opposition in my constituency and ask them if they could be of any help. Please do the same if you can. It’s time for reddit activism to translate into something. Greta was one protester, and she stood up for her rights.

**TL;DR: Look at your comment history, apart from memes, have you never voiced your frustration at the state of affairs? It’s become abundantly clear that we can’t vote these politicians out because of their rabid following but we need to be heard and say it’s not okay. WE NEED TO PROTEST. Please consider protesting against the central government. The benefits might not be clear to a lot of us right now, but it is the only way we get to be heard. If you are of the mind that this is futile and nothing will change and that would be your contribution to this thread, then please that it’s acknowledged and you can scroll on**",1574684604.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,36,132

2287,"Some inside information about the 'support letter' situation in MaharashtraI hope everyone is well aware about the political situation in Maharashtra right now. I will post TL;dr about the situation regardless.

\- No party has the majority

\- BJP fails to maintain the government

\- Shivsena isn't able to form a goverment

\- Presidents rule is applied

\- Shivsena + NCP + Congress prepares to form the government on Saturday afternoon

\- BJP + Ajit Pawar of NCP forms the government secretly at 5AM in the morning of the Saturday.

&#x200B;

The government is allowed to be formed by the Governor because Ajit Pawar produced a letter of support with signatures of all the MLA's of NCP. Now the missing link in the story was how did Ajit Pawar was able to get this letter when NCP was about to give support to Shivsena.

The reason behind this is, NCP prepared 4 letters in total. 1 was to provide support to ShivSena. 1 was to provide support to Congress. 1 was to claim the support of other parties to form their own government and the last one was to provide support to BJP. All these letters were with Ajit Pawar as he was the leader of NCP. Fadnavis Blackmailed Ajit Pawar on Friday Midnight which forced him to give this letter to Fadnavis and allowed him to form the government. Sharad Pawar is well aware of this as just a day before he was with Mr. Modi to talk about 'Farmers'. The situation became comical as Shiv Sena wasn't aware of this 4 letters existing and thus to save face, the 'letter was forged' argument is created.

2289,"[Ask India] People who don't fit-in and/or are introverts, how do you deal with life?TL;DR - need advice from fellow Indians who are good at maintaining friendships.

I (22/m) have been living in India most of my life. Used to stay in Mumbai and then moved to Bangalore for college, completing my undergraduate degree next year. I have always had an inclination for the arts; I study Design and make music on the side. Also, a biggie on video-games. Unfortunately, this always led me to spend most of my time with myself. Never formed any close friendships; let alone party/drink/smoke-up, etc. 

I sometimes envy the medical and engineering kids who share dorm rooms and anyway have to socialize, in the end making memories and friends they cherish for life. When I used to stay in Mumbai, I never fit because I was in a class full of girls (Arts, thank you) and even though I made some real connections, it didn't last long. When I moved to Bangalore, localites who spoke Kannada (or other South-Indian languages) quickly formed their groups and now at the end of these 4 years, I don't belong to any kind of 'community'.

Here's the funniest part - I do stand-up comedy time-to-time and am really good with people with decent communication skills. Yet I never find the courage nor time to actually form deeper connections.

What I fear most is that as I age and grow into an adult life, this part of me is only going to get worse due to a career and other paths I choose to pursue.

2299,"#MeToo Mahima, Utsav, and You: How To Maintain Sanity In This Insane Saga[Full Disclosure: I've worked with both Utsav and AIB as a writer for a while.]

Twitter is unravelling. Earlier, you were compelled took a radical stand against Utsav. Now, against Mahima. You're disillusioned. How will you take a stand again? What if you are wrong? You'd look stupid for believing something wrong passionately. I have a graceful solution for it. Three simple rules which if followed will avoid you guilt, save face, and make Twitter a healthier place.

1. Keep Room For Change
We take stands from what we know. What we know will always be incomplete and that's alright. Mostly, it works out just fine. Sometimes though, what's left out may change your view completely. You need to be mindful of that. It doesn't mean you have to be unsure of everything all the time. It just means it's wiser to avoid absolute statements - 'This is bad', 'This is horrible',etc., Have some room for a graceful change if the new details emerged. It's very simple - 'That sounds bad', 'That looks problematic',etc.,

2. Address Everyone With Dignity
Giving yourself some room for a graceful change means a few more things. Avoid addressing person morally - No name-calling, no implying they're hypocritical, etc., Always address everyone with dignity. You may wonder why shouldn't a creep be called a creep?
Simple. Tactics like name-calling tie you to a conclusion. You have to pick a side for it. That closes you to truth if new details emerge. Addressing all sides with dignity ensures you're open and neutral. I'm not asking you to use honorific titles. Just dignity. It is in your interests. Let me explain. 
Now that everything in this interconnected world is on social media, even a misstep of yours can blow-up massively. If it does, this culture of dignity will give you a fighting chance to survive. I'd say, even if Utsav or Mahima or anyone is found to be guilty, they still need to be treated with dignity. Every saint has a past, every sinner has a future.

3. Attend To Needs
The current approach on Twitter is to find a villain and then destroy them ruthlessly. I've seen people encouraging others to even commit suicide. Now, compare this approach to attending people's needs.
If you see someone getting abused, you attend to their need for safety. You attend to their need for healing. You're asking for safe places. That may mean someone in power having to step down. But that's not the focus. Your focus is not on destroying someone's career or life, but help building up someone's life. Are they getting enough chances for healing? Can you see how much more the healthier that conversation is?*

TL: DR Version: The Final Blue Print

In the dynamic world of social media, it's better to take stands judiciously. I provide a template for it below. Use it the next time Utsav tweets, or Mahima, or any other controversy. Feel free to use our own words:

1. Start with the issue: ""It seems _________. Could you address it?""

2. Reply whether convinced. If not convinced: ""Could you explain _________""

3. If you have to state your current position: ""I'm leaning towards _________""

Repeat.

Bonus Step: If you feel like connecting more: ""Do you need __________""

[*I must mention, the needs are of both sides. This means, even if the accused attempts to get a job, they're attending to his needs for sustenance. That's alright. I repeat, the focus is on helping people regain their lives. You may say that you don't need to attend to the needs of a person you hate. It's alright. I respect your need for autonomy.]

2325,"Thoughts about Tavleen Singh's articles in The Indian Express?I've been reading The Indian Express somewhat diligently for a few years now. The Sunday edition has an article by Tavleen Singh in the extra editorial column. It's usually a single column long article on the right side of the page.

Anyway, my question is whether anyone here likes the contents of her articles. I had stopped reading her articles a long while ago, but was recently wondering why she wasn't dismissed by the newspaper despite such poor quality of articles. And then I wondered if it was only my opinion that her articles are pathetic. Hence, this question.

What I don't like about her articles is that she is always sitting on the fence. It seems obvious to me that she is deliberately trying to word the articles in an equivocal language. And I think the reason behind this is that she wants to be in the clear no matter which party is in the power.   
And the second issue that I have is that I find her articles all over the place, hopping from one topic to the next, without a smooth transmission.   
And thirdly, the articles do not contain anything that is increasing the reader's knowledge, or giving a fresh perspective. On the few occasions when she does mention her analysis of the issue, it is the same as that posted in the newspaper's editorials a few days ago. All she seems to be doing is repeating some of the week's news by merely garnishing them with some idioms, fancy adjectives and pop-culture references.

Would this mean that inflation has hit 30 times the standard for educational institutions.  Or would this mean that the price for all institutions would rise eventually as they would now start pegging the price as per the ratio at JNU.

I started my first job in October 2018, got a salary of around 10k for one week of October, followed by 44k from November onwards. I have no other sources of income. The online tax calculators showed me that I don't have to pay any income tax even though the annual salary exceeds 5L. I receive the salary directly into my bank account and there's no break-up of allowances or salary slip. My employer hasn't told me anything about paying tax. The only tax deducted at source is a professional tax of ₹200/month.

My question are - Is it mandatory for me to file an IT return? Is my income taxable? Is the salary calculated from January to December or April to April? What if I make a mistake like forget to add interest from savings account?

As a guy who has never sexted in his life, how do people get aroused by the chats between him and Krupa. There's a difference between sensual and plain gross. Their chat history seems like the latter in my opinion. 

Some of the gems from their chats

Utsav to Krupa - I want to lick your face you sexy pussy owner.

It's a Hard Cock life.

I don't judge anyone. If they like it, then it's fine but is it just me who thinks that this sounds kinda gross.

Update : 

The woman in question, Krupa gohil has replied back

https://twitter.com/4ngery/status/1198647411394174977

She's saying that she only confided to her friends that Utsav is a creep and didn't say anything publicy and is yet facing the wrath of MRA.

Since my old phones space was full I had transfered the camera roll to the new phone.

Took and Ola to the mall. Went to the showroom and realised I did not have my phone in my pocket. Frantically called the driver but he denied finding any phone in his car. Backtracked my steps in the mall and searched everywhere for an hour but couldnt find it. It got switched off. Gave up after a while.

Fast forward 1 year my uncle told me he saw a random goddess picture in my old watsapp number d.p (im christian).
I tried calling the number and it rang for an hour or so. Later on the number was out of service. 
Late at night while I was pondering about the lost phone it suddenly hit me that I had a sex tape in my camera roll. I am panicking like hell. Havent been able to sleep for the past few days. Random Panic attacks through out the day. It has me and my ex's face clearly shown in the footage.

2480,"[Unpopular Opinion] Uddhav Thackeray is not as stupid as people think and Sena will gain at the expense of BJPIn few hours Supreme court will ask BJP to prove majority in 24 hrs and they WILL fail. Here's my read of whole situation as what has been happening!

EDIT 1: Disclaimer: I am not Sena supporter here (Nor NCP or Congress). I am not even sure if a govt under Uddhav as CM would be better than one under Fadnavis (Probably later with Center's full support would have been better?!?).

EDIT 2: Getting fair lot of downvotes here (I guess it IS unpopular opinion afterall ;D). Feel free to do so, but if you downvote can you please also even in one line or two try to argue your points. Just trying to educate myself about good argument against my thinking. Thank you.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sena / Uddhav is not as stupid as people think. They played hard ball game coz they do not want BJP to remain as ""big brother"" in alliance any more. They knew if they could try to corner BJP, the other two parties (NCP+Congress) WILL support them. Coz obviously if in ANY WAY NCP+Congress can also get a win over Modi+Shah they are going to take it. So Sena's hard ball game was good!

In any case, Sena's move to corner BJP (which emerged largest party for second time in a row), with the help of Congress-NCP was absolutely good one.

Now people are over-thinking saying what transpired over-night was Pawar's game plan. My read is, Sena+NCP+Congress were taking long time because they were absolutely trying to make sure common-minimum-program works and govt lasts for five years (Coz remember they are all tired of BJP winning all the time?!?)

Meanwhile BJP also knew that trio govt WILL last for 5 years (or at least there will be genuine effort, to curtail/stop BJPs continued successful run). So they tried to break Ajit Pawar (whom they could easily coerce coz otherwise they potentially can throw him behind bars like Bhujbal / Chidambaram) Here's a link -  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yi2Z7HT9RU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Yi2Z7HT9RU)

So what BJP did in the middle of night was pre-planned but still a very desperate measure (and they are gonna fail it). In fact they are gonna fail with huge loss of public goodwill. Coz in public's eyes you might call Sena-NCP-Congress as *unholy trinity*; but at least it was done in front of people with a lot of effort put to create common minimum program so that it wont be short lived govt.

What BJP did on the other hand was in secrecy from populace and promoting *tod-fod* politics + horse-trading.

So even though we have got used to thinking (due to recency bias) that Motabai is Chanakya or somehow think Pawar plays 4-D level chess, I think reality is Sena was now in good spot to play the whole game of ""toning down"" BJP's power-plays and will succeed with the help of NCP+Congress who have same agenda.",1574559055.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,40,131

Every morning I reach office and first thing I do is go through reddit while I have a cup of coffee. Everyday I see posts where people express themselves as to what is currently going on in the country.

Let us first of all accept that the county is going downstream and almost everything is in a mess. Everyone knows what is wrong with the government and what all things are currently going on. I am not here to discuss those.

I am here to discuss solutions, that we as responsible citizens should do.

I know Indian public is not much educated and they are brainwashed by the media and other entities. Let us discuss solutions to what we can do, apart from not voting for the same party, we also have to educate people to not vote for them, only and only then, India will have its new freedom.

I am trying to book tadoba jungle permit online at this website.

[https://nationalpark.mahaonline.gov.in/User/CitizenLogin.aspx](https://nationalpark.mahaonline.gov.in/User/CitizenLogin.aspx)

Does anyone know what are the charges?

I am planning in February.

What is weird is the booking page shows:

1. Entry fees 1000/-
2. Gypsy charges 2700/-
3. Guide charge 350/-

So total should be 4050/- but on confirmation page it shows total amount to pay 7100/- Rs!

If I try to book for December 15 or so.. it shows same breakup but total it shows 4100/-

Anyone has any clue what is happening? What am I missing?

Site also says that only entry fees to be paid and Gypsy / Guide charges to be paid on the spot. (when I reach there)

But then why the total charge to pay includes those charges?

Its totally confusing and makes no sense.

Please guide on how to book tadoba permit online

EDIT: (Answer)

Booking within 60-120 days in advance costs higher i.e. 4000Rs and booking within 3-60 days costs less i.e. 1000Rs. Gypsy and guide charges are now to be paid online (they have not changed wording on website, which creates the confusion)

So this is actual breakup:

1. Entry fees 4000/-
2. Gypsy charges 2700/-
3. Guide charge 350/-
4. Online booking charge 50/-
5. PayTM / bank charges vary from 3Rs to 10Rs. Credit / debit card charges are crazy!! (so pay via netbanking only)

2531,"Should I take complete break from work by resigning with no alternative at hand?TLDR: I am in a good job with good potential growth in a good work environment with a good manager and want advice whether I should leave my job to discover other things/areas without any alternative

Hi, a fellow Indian who is little confused about his career/passion and could use little counseling from fellow redditors.

So let me begin. I work for a consulting based firm, earn a decent amount to afford a decent lifestyle. Its been 2 years into the job life, current company being the only firm I have ever worked with. Got placed just after my undergrad from college (one of the IITs, this was my first and only interview till date). 

As I said, I am in the data analytics consulting business to a banking client. The work is challenging, works hours gruelling on some days but I think the challenge makes it worth it. Work environment is pretty great. Colleagues/managers are some of the best intellectual beings and really challenge you to grow in every walks of life. If I stay in this company, there is good growth awaiting, both financially and responsibility wise. Even if I switch in the relevant field, I will be earning a very decent amount with the hike.

BUT...

The big but is I am at a stage where in I am not really sure if this is something I wish to do for the rest of my life. The consultancy is all about gathering data and presenting it to your upper management so they can convince their upper management so they can convince their seniors and so on and so forth. You just remain a cog in the wheel whose value is defined by the number of powerpoint presentations he/she can churn out or by the extent he/she can think out of the box to present and justify the numbers the upper management wants. You don't really feel the actual value addition here or may be I am just being naive here.

So my plan is to take a break from corporate job, explore my other interests and see if something else in my life can be monetised to survive. I have some savings. I can easily survive 8-10 months without a job but the fear of things not working out and falling 8-10 months behind my peers is daunting to me and frankly I don't know if I can fake that level of confidence.

I have some interests. I used to do trading stocks/derivatives, I know some creative skills like photoshop, video editing, I would also like to explore my writing capabilities on medium/Quora or may be start my own blog. Guys, please share your experiences with me. Anyone who has done the same, please do write and broaden my horizon. Positives/ negatives all are welcome, just be constructive. Any other info, I will be happy to provide.",1574595164.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,15,6

2565,"Which Water Purifier to purchase? (also a small rant about Eureka Forbes AquaGuard)I need to purchase a new Water Purifier and I'm utterly confused about which model and brand to purchase, which is what I hope you guys will help me out with.

So why do I need a new Water purifier, well this is where the rant part of my post comes in. I bought a AquaGuard Total Sensa SMP+ or whatever the fuck its called about 7-8 years ago. At the time the dealer said it was the best purifier on the market and was worth the ₹\~18000 I was paying him because it had 3 different filtration systems (RO+UV, UV+UF and just UF iirc). It served us pretty well, the water was very pure and 'tasty'. The issues started around 1-2 years back. The filters had to be replaced every 6-12 months (which cost ₹\~5000) and then about a year ago the Aquaguard technician said that the product wasn't working and since there are no spare parts available from the company he did something to the PCB and connections such that it was stuck on the RO+UV mode and the operation light wasn't working (so basically gimping most of the functionality that I paid ₹18000 for). Now, mere months after replacing the filter (which apparently was a very old one which the first technician installed) and now in another city, the technician in this city is saying that they need to be replaced again and that more electrical components have to be replaced. It seems that the technician are running a scam, because I've been in 2 different cities and in both the technicians say the same thing, almost as if its being read from a script, ""Your product is very old, company doesn't make spare parts for it anymore, I can either sell you a new model or I can get the parts from somewhere else (not from the company), so I'll close the company work order but you call me directly if there is any issue and I'll replace it, oh and don't tell the company about this or they'll fire me"".  I asked him to return in the evening with the new filters, then I called and said that I changed my mind and may purchase a new water purifier. He said he'll come and show me the new models but I refused and said I'll decide on my own, then he said its not worth buying a new one and said that he'll repair my existing one instead and I asked him how he'll repair it since no spare parts from the company are available to which he replied by saying that there are spare parts from the company. I told him that I needed time to decide and hung up. It must be noted that the EurekaForbes customer service is pretty good, its just these technicians and dealers that seem to be running a scam.

So now I'm left with two options:

1. Pay ₹5000 for the filter change, which the technician says has to be replaced again in a year or less, plus whatever it costs to change the electrical components.
2. Buy a new Water Purifier, all of which seem quite expensive.

What do you guys think I should do? Should I just pay the dude ₹5000 or should I purchase a new water purifier entirely?

If its the latter, which company should I go for and what features should I look for? I also want something that wont require me to change the filters every year and a company that has excellent after sales service unlike AquaGuard but if AquaGuard is the best then I guess we'll have to settle for it. We've gotten pretty acclimatised to RO water and water from any other source is very weird to drink now, so it'd have to have RO filtration as well.

I've also read that I should check the TDS of my water supply. I don't want to call the technician over again so can I just purchase a TDS meter like [this one](https://www.amazon.in/Generic-Digital-Waterfilter-Measuring-Multicolor/dp/B01LTI203Q/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=tds+meter&qid=1574585068&refinements=p_85%3A10440599031&rnid=10440598031&rps=1&sr=8-3) and measure the TDS myself?

There are many brands on Amazon like Faber and Blue Star which are offering a RO system for around 11-12k but when it come to water purification I've never heard of these brands. How good are they?",1574585186.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,7

2573,"Dropped out of college today due to chronical illness and clinical depression and anxiety, what are my options when it comes to working from home?Hi.

This is tough. Writing this down. But I'll try.

I've been a chronical illness patient for almost a decade now and I have tried so much to get back to the person I was before that. But while you can work really hard on physical health,mental health is not easy. Besides chronical illness I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety stemming out of my life long disease. But I've tried to get back to the grind,tried to be strong. And now even after repeated attempts to get the 'normal' life back,life has shown me the door once again.

Dropping out of my masters today because of declining health,mentally and physically and once again that 9-5 job has escaped my clutches. But I couldn't do it. It was so hard the last few months. I don't even have the energy to wake up in the morning..the will power to take care of myself. 

Now I am writing this down in this subreddit is because I think you guys will understand what a degree entails in India and how much it matters. And most importantly,how without a degree,your chances of getting a normal job is impossible. Add to it,how much a burden it is to explain to people you basically dropped out because of mental health issues. 

My parents are coming to take me back today. I had come here with so many dreams for myself but my mental health has failed me.

So,I just wanted to ask.. what are my work from home options? Because looking at where I am at life today,I don't think my health will ever permit me to do a 9-5.. I've been such a good student all my life so this is so destabilizing. 

Please tell me what and how I can have a chance at a financially secure life while working from home? Do I get to have one? 

I am fairly decent at content writing. I have 3 years of experience on and off..so what are my options there? Or is there something else I can learn to do work-from-home jobs better? 

And because am desperate enough,if there is anyone who can hire a content writer as a full time but work from home basis,please let me know.

Any website where I can pursue content writing as a full job,something that pays decently, I just don't know where to start. 

Thank you so much for hearing me out. Its been a long journey and am really tired. Honestly want to sleep for a long time but regrets are making it hard for me.

2727,"Keeping in mind the recent political drama in Maharashtra, wouldn't it be a much better if National political parties like Congress and BJP were not allowed to stand for State elections?Edit: Made a typo in the title. It should be 'wouldn't it be much better' instead of 'wouldn't it be a much better'. 

To elaborate further, wouldn't it be better if National parties were not allowed to have any involvement at all in state elections and state politics (excluding appointment of governors and imposition of president's rule)?

This would also further reinforce the Federal structure of India, allow national parties to focus on national issues and state parties to focus on state issues and prevent a single party from possessing massive amounts of control at the same time. 

I feel like national parties being involved in State politics is a HUGE conflict of interest, especially for the party in power.",1574524643.0,,Politics,dark,8,9

AFAIK BSNL is the only ISP that services this area but I've applied for a FTTH connection and a land-line connection literally a dozen times since Sunday and they've not responded yet (I've received a message saying sales team will call me but I haven't received a single call yet).

Airtel isn't available here, nor is YOU broadband or Tatasky Broadband. 

I tried searching online but all I can find on Google is websites like Just Dial who claim to show you 'the top 50 ISPs in Camp, Pune' but when you click on the link to their website you have to fill in your contact details just to see those 'top 50 ISPs' which I'm not gonna do because they're obviously gonna sell it to marketers and I don't want to be bombarded with 20 advertisement calls everyday for a hair loss prevention pill.

So do you guys know any local ISPs or have any recommendations? If my only option is BSNL (which I'm fine with btw) how do I contact them and ensure that they provide connection ASAP (mobile network signal is poor inside my house so I need an internet connection quite quickly)?",1574449118.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,17,11

They are quite close with their neighbours who are very comfortable. My in-laws are actually like grandparents to their children with how close they all are. 

They are early to mid 30s and have helped with arranging doctors, payments, and just being active in helping my sister in law through every step of the way. They have been amazing and I can't thank them enough for all they have done. In saying that , I would like to do or buy something for them. 

I would love to do or buy something for them as a thank you. Either something I can send, or we have other family there that I can help arrange over there if needed. The reason I brought up that they are comfortable is because what do you do for someone who is already quite wealthy?

3012,"The absence of research and science in our public discourseI'm often amazed that even well-educated Indians with fancy MBA degrees don't get the point of doing research. It seems like an ""academic"" thing with ""no real world"" implications. This is the feedback I get when I discuss business research findings with many friends who are in high positions in the corporate world here, and should be on top of the trends. Instead they just laugh and think anything published by a thought leader like a professor or a think tank is not ""practical"". 

Research is not restricted to labs or professors. In most countries, professors and scientists are highly regarded in policymaking and business. In India, there is literally no scientist in any cabinet position, and research is not considered to be an ""aspirational"" profession. People would rather be bankers and lawyers. 

This usually happens in very evolved first world places but India is a country where even agarbattis are imported and there's not a single circuit board that's made. Society won't get ahead without connecting industry and science, and policy.",1574484044.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,12,80

3017,"Should I continue with this relationship?Me(27M) and gf(26F) have been dating for 3 years. I am doing a graduate degree abroad, so it has been largely long distance. We meet up 4 times a year (that's also our holiday). 
Things have been going well, but a few issues have cropped up lately. 

1. Ideological: I have been living outside home and have a center of right political view. She has just moved or of her home to a new city 2 months ago, and believes in left idealism. I used to share her perspective till I was 20 but my experience in dealing with a labor union at work made me change my political stance. This would not be an issue if she let it be- she accuses me of being a Trump supporter and right-wing moron everytime i express a different opinion. 

2. Lack of sensitivity: i am doing a PhD, and jobs are hard to come by. I have never slept peacefully in the last 8 months. Yet, she blasts me everyday for delaying her dream marriage. She works in a job that just about makes her ends meet, with some support from me. I haven't had a meal at a restaurant in over a year because i want to save money for the wedding, by she still accuses me of being a jerk and non committal. Have expressed my situation 1000 times but all i get is that ""I am not working hard enough"". I haven't slept before 3 am and woken up afer 8am in the last 2 years. My hair has greyed due to the stress. 
But it is of no consequence. She has decided i don't work hard. 

3. Kids: i work on climate change related issues and I don't see the point of bringing more life into this world. The next generation is fucked. Unless you inherit wealth, even a Harvard degree won't get you clean air and the chance at a stable job. Automation is killing jobs and climate change is ruining infrastructure. I am glad to be able to adopt a child. She says I'm betraying her trust. It is true that I was okay with procreation earlier, but the more I've studied the field, the more I'm convinced that the next generation is going to have it much harder than us. I am willing to compromise on this though, just that I feel that my concerns have 0 weightage because she says her sisters have kids. I feel hurt by this. 

4. Parents: her parents are forcing me to marry next year. I don't have a job yet despite my best efforts. She says i disrespect her parents, although I've tried accomodating their requests in every way. But i cannot marry before financial independence. 

5. Migration: she wants me to migrate to a first world country like Canada or Australia and work there. My interest lies in gradually scaling up an R&D business in India. I have nothing against migration, but doing so for the sake of giving birth to a child with a first world citizenship is not my goal in life. I told her to apply for a graduate degree abroad and I'll follow, but she accuses me of being non committal and cheating on her.

Irony is that so far, being a somewhat conservative person (Christian) we have never had penetrative sex because i abstained. I never look at other women with a lustful eye, but am accused of being a cheat everytime i have a different opinion. Want to end my ordeal somehow, or myself. I love her, but love cannot be conditional I guess from the other side. What's your opinion.",1574448168.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,80,42

3044,"[Rant] The problems I face being an Indian studentBefore I begin my rant, I'd like to tell some of my achievements - not because I want to brag - but because this is needed for the context.

I am a undergrad student of an IIT studying Computer Science and Engineering. I have the highest GPA in my branch (will probably pass out as the gold medalist). I have completed two internships and will complete a third before sitting for on-campus placements, and have mentored several students.

I have to face incompetent professors who mentally harass me. A professor came to me and said - ""if you want to pass in my subject, you will have to do an assignment"". When I asked what assignment, he said - ""when I (the prof) entered the class, one student passed a rude comment at me, you have to go and find out who that student was"".

I sometimes get suicidal thoughts. I haven't slept for the last 32 hours. We have tests, assignments, presentations almost daily and those keep me engaged so much that sometimes I don't even get time to eat or talk to my parents properly. With relative grading being practiced, every single marks matters and the competition is very intense.

Most companies in India do not value student's time. I applied for an internship at Linkedin. They gave me 3 questions to solve (which I solved). Then they rejected my application saying I have a low GPA. Firstly, I don't have a low GPA, and even if they think my GPA is so low that they were to reject my application even after I solved all the problems, why the hell did they tell me to solve those questions. A similar incident happened with American Express too.

I'm surrounded by people who want me to work for them for free. Startup owners who want me to make their websites, my professor who wants me to write research papers FOR HIM (so that he can publish them with his own name), and the list goes on.

My parents' expectations from me are increasing every year. While they are trying there best to hide these, it becomes visible when I talk to them. My father is like - ""jaldi se graduate ho jaao, fir kamaa ke laake dena shuru karna, ab mera kaam karne ka mann nahi hota bilkul, tum jahaan job karoge wahin pe rakh lena ek room dekr, bas khaaunga aur sounga."" My mother wants me to give 10 Lakhs for my sister's wedding expenses.

Edit: I am reading all of the comments. Thank you so much to all those who said motivating words. Helped me a lot. Whenever I feel demotivated again, I'll come here and read your comments :)
I see that some of you (specially IITians) feel this is a fake post, but it isn't. You have made some assumptions in your mind (which are incorrect), which make you feel this is a fake post. I already have an offer much better than Amex, it's just that I wanted to point out that Amex/LinkedIn wasted my time. With the increasing number of suicides in IITs, whenever someone says he is getting suicidal feelings, please deal with this seriously instead of assuming he is lying/faking. Hopefully, this will make IITs a better place to live in :)",1574418184.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,30,50

So I was curious if the text itself corresponds with the Janapadas or the Mahajanapadas, which appear to be divided right around the life of the Buddha.",1574413068.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,9,11

3107,"Hotstar video quality is total crapI've got a 100mbps connection which plays Netflix, Prime YouTube at full hd or even 4k (YouTube only) absolutely fine. But Hotstar is a completely different animal. 

First of all, it never remembers your video setting. No matter what you do, new videos will start at auto resolution which is probably 480p or lower. It never gets better like Netflix does, no auto scaling. The quality remains 480p. But then there's an override setting. You can select high and it will scale to full hd. But only for some titles.

For many titles, the quality gets stuck to 480p no matter what you do, no setting can override this. You can skip, pause but nothing works. 

So, is this problem only with me, or does anyone else see this kind of problems in their phone?

App: Hotstar Android
Phone: Samsung Note 9

I don't know. It kind of looks as if Hotstar is trying to save bandwidth costs. Out of all the major streaming apps, Hotstar is the only one without hdr, and it's video bandwidth is already pretty less (pixelations). But now it seems that they have decided to remind the customers - you get what you pay for.

3135,"Government says judicial review of severity of the restrictions in Kashmir during August is an “academic exercise”### 

https://preview.redd.it/gskjfi1lw6041.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=39f6a7e10eabafa953108a91a7c52ac829f2b968

### Tl;dr

The Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta began arguments for the government before the Supreme Court today in Anuradha Bhasin’s petition against the communication shutdown and movement restrictions in Kashmir. He started by arguing that what happened on 05 August 2019 was a conferment of rights on the people of Jammu and Kashmir rather than a restriction of rights. According to him, due to the abrogation of Article 370, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir can now take advantage of 106 people friendly laws. He criticized the petitioner and intervenors for painting a grim picture of the situation prevailing in Kashmir and cited certain facts and figures to demonstrate normalcy in the region. He finally submitted that the powers under Section 144, CrPC could be invoked pre-emptively in anticipation of public disorder and urged the Court to not scrutinize the orders too stringently.   


### Not in our names

The Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta started arguments for the Former State of Jammu and Kashmir on an unexpected note today. He insisted that the actions of the government on 05 August 2019 must be applauded because they have conferred basic human rights that the people of Jammu and Kashmir were previously denied due to Article 370. Some of the examples cited by him include strengething of panchayati raj institutions, safai karamcharis and women being able to own property, SC/ST individuals being able to avail reservation benefits, central legislations on prohibition of child marriage, juvenile justice, domestic violence and right to education being made applicable to the region, and justice for West Pakistan refugees. The factual veracity of these claims is questionable, and this attempt at appropriation of progressive causes to justify the clampdown in Kashmir will be addressed by the petitioner and intervenors during their rejoinder.   


### All is well now in November

Mr. Mehta accused the petitioner and intervenors of resorting to hyperbole and misrepresenting the situation on the ground in Kashmir. He criticized the petitioner and intervenors for failing to highlight the easing of restrictions by the government during their oral submissions and stated that the region has not been under complete clampdown for over 100 days. He added that since the restrictions have been significantly eased now, scrutinizing the state of affairs in August is an ""academic exercise"" and the case has outlived itself. He quoted government statistics relating to restoration of telecommunication services, easing of movement restrictions, board exam attendance rates, functioning of hospitals, provision for public transport, internet access terminals, tourism, media facilitation centre etc to counter the petitioner and intervenors' arguments about a humanitarian crisis existing in Kashmir.

These facts and figures were not made available to the petitioner, intervenors or the court in advance and they were tendered across the table during the hearing. The veracity of these factual assertions will also be challenged by the petitioner and intervenors during the rejoinder. For instance, the inadequate and insecure nature of the media facilitation centre had already been mentioned in the pleadings filed by the petitioner and the intervenors but the government did not address any of these concerns. Read more about the problems with the media facilitation centre in Srinagar [**here**](https://www.newslaundry.com/2019/08/13/kashmir-press-freedom-curfew-article-370) and [**here**](https://www.firstpost.com/india/srinagar-media-facilitation-centre-only-place-in-kashmir-reporters-can-access-internet-now-off-limits-for-freelancers-and-web-journos-7636221.html).  


### Cracking nuts with sledgehammers

Throughout today’s hearing, the government maintained that the vast majority of people in Kashmir are law abiding and peace loving. However, there is a “miniscule minority” which indulges in separatism and cross border terrorism, and the government had to impose restrictions on everyone because they cannot separate the  chaff from the grain. 

The Solicitor General, Tushar Mehta and Attorney General, KK Venugopal cited historical figures relating to terrorist violence since 1990 and the Supreme Court’s observations in another case about Pakistan supporting terrorist groups like the Hurriyat to establish why these restrictions were required. The government lawyers claimed that terrorists were not just physically penetrating India’s borders but they were also mobilizing people through digital platforms. However, the government did not explain why one to one modes of communication such as landlines and voice calls which cannot be used for mass messaging were shutdown and why the restrictions were not limited to social media platforms.

Mr. Mehta further urged the court to not evaluate the orders under Section 144, Cr.P.C.  imposing movement restrictions too strictly because they were issued by district magistrates who are not legally trained. He also argued that the fact that several restrictions were either not imposed or relaxed sooner in Jammu and Ladakh compared to Kashmir demonstrates that there was application of mind by the government officials. 

The Solicitor General will continue his arguments on Monday, 25 November 2019 and the petitioner and intervenors will respond to the government’s assertions after that.

The person that I called requested that we exchange whatsapp info and make the reservation that way and up front the reservation costs 1500 rupees.

3192,"Am I being paranoid?My parents are approaching their 60s. Every passing year i can sense a deterioration in their health. They had me much later than what's considered normal. When I was younger it didn't bother me. Now that I've matured I'm concerned about the state of my family. I haven't achieved stability in life.

I vividly remember  standing outside a 5 star hotel and telling my mother I'd acquire it someday. She smiled at my naivete. At that moment she lauded my boldness, ambitions. Heart of hearts she knew that it was unattainable. Since childhood I've been exceedingly close to my mother. She was my confidant. I've for as long as I can remember been an introverted person.


Due to failures my introversion changed into shyness, timidity. Parents were overly protective. They were well meaning but it acted as a detriment. I couldn't sharpen my social skills. Now in my early 20s I've realised how much I lack. They worked tirelessly to ensure a good education for me. I coasted and instead of becoming a critical thinking, contributing member of this society I see myself as a leech.

I take more than I give. I wanted my parents to be proud of me. They live me undoubtedly. But I refuse to believe they feel honour in being my parents. I couldn't get into a top institution.

3221,"Encryption Pe Charcha: A Public Lecture by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran | November 23 | 6:30 PM | Constitution Club of India&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qu1ryw7or7041.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=e1ada7086e1fba97fcb74c657936d18dcc5f6c2f

Are you tired of simplistic lock and key analogies which pervade most legal and policy discourse surrounding encryption? The last year has seen encryption technologies become a subject of intense discussion in courts and within the government. In India and several other countries, there are demands to weaken encryption through backdoors and key escrow systems to facilitate easier access to information for law enforcement agencies. At the same time, encryption is also one of the few tools available to individuals to protect themselves from surveillance by Big Brother and Big Tech. 

To bring greater clarity and technical rigour to the public discourse surrounding encryption, Internet Freedom Foundation is hosting a lecture on **‘Encryption, Security and Privacy in the Digital Age’** by **Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran** on **Saturday, 23 November 2019** from **6:30 PM to 8:00 PM** at the **Constitution Club, New Delhi**. Dr. Prabhakaran is a Chair Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and he specialises in cryptography. Through this public lecture, Dr. Prabhakaran will explain the technical aspects of encryption in a comprehensible but nuanced manner and discuss the importance of cybersecurity and online privacy in light of contemporary developments.

We would be delighted if you could join us for the public lecture and [**you can register for the event here**](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/encryption-pe-charcha-a-public-lecture-by-dr-manoj-prabhakaran-tickets-81279764965).

3254,"Am I wrong to not feel Indian anymore?I grew up very proud or lets say happy to be Indian.  As a kid I dreamt of helping and contributing to society and to work towards improving the lives of both Indian Muslims as well Indians of other faiths who were destitute. But these past couple of years, the amount of burning hot hatred for my religion and community in the country that is very visible online and elsewhere has shattered a part of my identity. The most important part of my identity has been Islam but the next most important aspect was being Indian. An Indian Muslim is what I have always seen myself be. 

But the current climate has made me for the first time ever develop resentment towards the nation. I don't like myself being Indian anymore and feel as if I don't belong no matter what a small portion of people who disagree with me say. I'm even having thoughts that my grand parents committed a major blunder by staying during the partition and greatly wronged their descendents. They were middle class and could have afforded to move just like their close friends and family did. Only really poor uneducated Muslims stayed and most rich and educated moved except them.

I now tend to avoid all news about India in general and platforms online like Twitter and Quora where Indians tend to congregate as to not come across anything that might increase my resentment and disconnect with the country.

As an Indian Muslim, can you advise me on whether or not my thoughts and feelings are justified or hold any basis? And also how I can adopt a less pessimistic view as an Indian Muslim towards the country?",1574431978.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,77,68

3324,"Suicide Epidemic in India*All data is available as open source information if anyone needs reference, please let me know.*

According to WHO there were 230,314 suicides in India during year 2015 to 2016, that means every two minutes a person commits suicide in India. Suicide was one of the most common cause of deaths for age group between 15 to 40 years. 

According to Center for Global Health Research the age group between 15 to 24 is more likely to commit suicide than any other age group. Suicide is number 1 cause of death for this age group with 16% suicide rate more than accident which causes about 12% deaths. 

According to ADSI report by Government of India (2016) 80% of suicide victims were literate suggesting suicide is more common among people with higher education. 

The same report suggest Chennai was suicide capital of India followed by Banglore, Delhi, Mumbai and Jabalpur. 

For every 4 suicide in world 1 person is an Indian. Female suicide account for one third on global scale. Indian has 17% of world population but accounts for about 25% suicides.

This data suggest India is on a verge of suicide epidemic. Something needs to be done. Suicide is more common than we think. Specially in young age between 15 to 30 years.

How can I have the most authentic experience possible?I grew up in a Hindu-Buddhist household and have never been to my motherland. I am 29 and feel called to finally visit for a number of reasons. Like Muslims make a pilgrimage to Mecca, many adherents of Dharma (the universal law that all Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists build their life around) make a trek to Mount Kailash. The place just speaks to me, I haven't felt a pull to a place like this ever in my life.

I know there are many logistical loops to jump through in the coming month for me but I am planning ahead right now because the best time to visit is between April and June or mid-September to late October. The first thing I need to decide on is whether I go from Delhi or from Kathmandu. I can make the rest of the decisions based on this.

I don't feel called to see the Taj Mahal or many of the things that people often associate with trips to India. The only thing I have felt called to see in person is the Himalayas. I can always go back in later life to see other parts like Delhi, Rishikesh, Varanasi, Bodh Gaya, etc. The only thing about landing in Delhi is saying 'I've been to India' but if we are speaking culture and ideas, Nepal and Tibet are extensions of Indian civilization. What's the difference really in the grand scheme?

Going from Kathmandu, I would save time and money plus be able to be in the Himalayas for the whole time. I plan to go to Thailand and Angor Wat after, which would give me the experience of visiting a Hindu temple too.

I am asking here to learn about other people's trips have been like, maybe learn some things to make the experience smoother, and to ultimately, make the most of the trip there.

Thanks for your help! This means the world to me right now.",1574440612.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,26

📜 I started these Giveaways on Dec 22, last year, just the day before my birthday. It's been a year already! It's my birthday again tomorrow, and even though it's only been 21 days since our [last giveaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/dq12g8/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_both/), I launched this one early because why not! Also, this is the 9th giveaway, and not 12th, because I posted some really late.

It all started from 1984 by George Orwell, I am talking about the [First Giveaway here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9z3lxo/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_1984_by/). I launched the [Second Giveaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a22a3v/hello_i_am_giving_away_free_copies_of_animal_farm/) the next month, and I gave away more than 500 books in the first two Giveaways. I made a post about that [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a3ymvw/i_started_two_giveaways_few_days_ago_new/). Since then, I have given away literally thousands of books! I did not plan this at all, and I have never done anything like this before; and I really did not expect the wonderful response I received from all the people here. Also, I didn't expect any help, but in the first few giveaways, I received some donations too, which helped in sponsoring some books, which was really nice. It means a lot to me, and I really appreciate that, because doing this does cost me a bank. It really makes me happy, looking at the end result. It's not a huge thing, it's a really small cause. I just want people to read more, start asking WHY more often, start critical thinking. I think reading is essential for that. I want to do this more and more, I hope I'll be able to! 🤞🏻🙂

**One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez**

On One Hundred Years of Solitude: I was introduced to Marquez by his 'Love in the Time of Cholera' a few years ago, and I loved it. I really liked his prose. I picked up One Hundred Years of Solitude a little late. Marquez received Nobel for this book. Years are passing by but time stands still – such is a perception of solitude. Such is a feeling created by this book. I don't think this is a book to ""get."" But if you do ""get it,"" it’d be a good ride. It’s a difficult and confusing read for some. I haven’t read much from this genre, Magic Realism, but this was different. I loved it. There is elegance and charm in the words and passages. Its like a poem, the words are flowing so flawlessly its addictive. This book is a treasure house for readers who admire words. It’s written in prose that’s languid and lush, but with a constant threat of devastation and ruin lurking underneath, the feeling that something has inevitably broken and cannot be fixed, but must be brought to its conclusion. It’s sometimes confusing too, because the world building is different here, and then there is a lot of confusions because of the same names. Judging by the reviews of this book, people have mixed feelings about this. They either really love this one, or not at all. I hope you like it!


Quotes from the book:

> “It's enough for me to be sure that you and I exist at this moment.” 

> “Thus they went on living in a reality that was slipping away, momentarily captured by words, but which would escape irremediably when they forgot the values of the written letters.”

**If you are interested in reading this, here's how you can get it!**

I send the books through *Gift Registries*. With gift registries, you don't have to disclose your personal details and address to me. Gift registries are safe, from privacy point of view. I won't be able to see any Addresses/Mobile or anything, it's completely confidential. 
If you don't know how Gift Registries work, don't worry, here's how you can set it up in 5 minutes:
> Log in to you Amazon.in account.

> Go to 'Your Account' > 'Your Addresses' > Click on Add Address > Save your full address including your mobile number > Save > Click on 'Set as Default' to make that address your default [This is important]

> Now Create a WishList, it should be Public and not Shared. Remember to check the box that says 'Third Party Shipping Agreement', when you make the list.

> Now search for the title of the book, and add the book to the same Public WishList.

> And you're done!

After you're done with setting up your Gift Registry:

* You first need to request for the book by commenting on this post, so to get visibility, and I can add you to my list from there. This way I get to manage list of requests in a sequence.
* Now you need to DM me your WishList link. Please don't copy the invite link, you need to copy the WishList link from 'Send list to others' button or directly from URL :)
* Though I try to fulfill every request made here, I don't send the books to users whose accounts are relatively new, and/or if their Karma is too low. This is because people create new accounts, or use their old throwaway accounts just to get free stuff. This is abusing the system, the honor code.

3354,"Corruption at IIT GuwahatiHi Everyone,

I am one of the alumni of IIT Guwahati and some recent activities by the college administration are making me write this post.

A little background:
One of the professors by the name Brijesh K Rai from the Electrical department was recently terminated from his position because he challenged the admin and questioned their practices.
From many people posting on social media, it is evident that the said professor is a good guy and always on the side of the students.
I will provide you with a link of the professor's interview about the corruption in the institute at the end of this post.
An RTI filed by one of the students revealed that the recently appointed Director of the institute has spent almost 15 Lakhs of taxpayers money to buy furniture and other stuff for his office. Not including the renovations and accessories bought for the director's bungalow.
The director has previously faced backlash for holding meetings in a 5Star Hotel in the city ignoring all the conference halls and facilities in the campus. There's even a luxurious guest house with said facilities to add to the fact.
May be because of being a thorn on the administration side so long, Mr. Rai was terminated from his post.

To condemn the actions of the admin, many students have participated in a candle march as a support to Mr. Rai.
Now the administration has sent mails to some of the students to fill up a questionnaire about the protest and to give the names of the people who were a part of it.

There was a recent email from the administration to all the IITG Alumni saying that the email service to the alumni will be discontinued because of lack of funds 🙄. It's basically severing the institute's relationship with it's Alumni.
The admin has no funds for mailing, but they got millions of rupees for beautification of the institute roads and the director's desks.

The admin was never a student friendly one during my time in the campus and I doubt much has changed now.
There have always been issues raised by some concerned people in the past about the corruption and other activities in the campus.
I remember one of such professors who got relocated to other institute after getting fed up by this kind of shit.

I'm writing this post on the hope that it will be viral and someone will pick it up and report it.

It's time that something has to be done or one of the finest institute of learning in the country will turn into another breeding ground for corrupt assholes.

Currently I belong to someone else though I would become yours.*

Seems like he is married but still loves his previous gf.

I think its the reality of many stories worldwide, people marrying someone else due to some pressure while still affectionate for their previous partner.

It is 75x45 cm, and unfortunately it does not fit in my [luggage](https://imgur.com/J1CJjAK) , so I cannot take it with me!

So, I am considering shipping it to my home, in Prague, Czech Republic, however what I found is very expensive, ranging at around 10.000 INR. Now, I would consider shipping it, if I could identify its value. 

I cannot go and ask my colleagues this, because in my country it is considered very impolite, so I am trying to find it through other channels.

If it helps, they purchased in in Garuda Mall in Bangalore, and I will go tomorrow there to check out the stores, maybe I find the store. In the meantime, I am asking you fine people if you can help.

This is a bit urgent, because I am flying out tomorrow evening.

3595,"[RANT] Frustated because of my wife and her constant nagging about joining a high paying but stressful jobFor context, me and my wife have been married for four years and we're in late 20s. Last year, my manager told me that I could take up a job in Bangalore which would pay me 20lpa+. Right now, I live in a Tier 2 city and I make around 12lpa and my wife makes around 5 so we live a decent life, not too extravagant. 
Look at my life: 
-Good society to live in and my wife agrees with me on that.
-clean air
-24x7 water + power(we bought an inverter)
-safety for women

My job is good. My manager is a good person and doesn't overwork me and I reach home mostly by 6 or 7. 
This is a good life but my wife has been nagging me since that Bangalore job offer, saying that if I take that job it'll be easy for her to quit hers and then have kids. That is a fair point but I don't want to move to a city like Mumbai/Bangalore. 
I have asked around and they overwork their employees, the pay is definitely good but commute is a problem and I dont want to reach home at 9/10pm everyday. There's pollution and bad roads and it'll just give me more stress. 

Every single week, we fight on this topic on whether to move to a Tier 1 city or not. I grew up in a Tier 1 city and saw my dad slog through every day in local trains and buses, getting angry at the smallest things because of stress and now he's retired, popping pills and going to doctors because he has pain in his joints. That man can't even drive a car for more than 3 hours. 
I don't want to end up like him. I'll agree that if I move to Mumbai/Bangalore/Delhi then my salary growth be awesome but I doubt that I will get peace that I enjoy now. 

This topic is really stupid and raising a kid in a Tier 2 city isn't that bad but that thought doesn't go through my wife's mind. We can easily survive in our city with my salary alone because the apartment we live in is my dad's but my wife is only thinking about one thing and that is : 💰💰💰💰. What the fuck am I going to do with this money if I have invest it in medicines thay I'll pop each day due to stress and bad air?

I doubt that my wife will return back to work if I get a package of 20+lpa. She has said that after 35, she would like to focus on the kids. Now this shit didn't come up during the arrange marriage talks, this shit came up one year into the marriage. Chutiya bana gayi ye mujhe. 

I still have no problem with her leaving the job because till she turns 35, I'll probably be in the ""1.6lpm"" category and it'll be a peaceful life. Because of this shit, I'm constantly angry about certain things. Today I screamed at the newspaper wala because he was late. I'm a calm person but by god ki kasam, pareshaan kar dia hai isne.
I asked my mom aur meri maa mahaan. She completely supported my wife's stance saying that you should earn lots of money. 
I'm just not wasting my youth sitting in a car for 2 hours just to cross 1km so that I can earn a few lakhs more. 
How tf am I supposed to explain this shit to her? She'll at home watching tv whereas I'll out there in dhool mitti pradushan. *sigh*

We have decided to have one kid. 1.6lpm seems fine to raise 1 kid. 

Any advice? I'm quite stubborn so I won't be leaving this place. I'm asking advice on how to properly show her the positives of living here. 
The extreme step that I have thought of is threaten her with divorce. I don't think she'd want to divorce me nor I would but threatening her could shut up this conversation. We're good on all terms but this topic comes up every single week and it's giving me a headache. Sometimes she will say snarky comments that we would probably be able to buy a new home somewhere else if I had higher salary. I have started giving her snarky comments back but sometimes she calls my mom and I have already written about my mom above.

Just answer me this, will threatening her with divorce shut her up?

https://preview.redd.it/4n7ppv8vizz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=01c0e86c248a8b1209a625794d59dffe783c2b87

### Tl;Dr

Much like our representation to the Standing Committee on Home Affairs, we sent across a few concerns on the Pegasus Spyware incident to the Standing Committee on IT that we thought needed addressing at their meeting on November 20, 2019. Our primary ask has been that the Committee invite those affected by the hacking to provide testimonials!

### Some background

If you haven't caught up with the ongoings of India's recent cyber-security incident, here's a statement we put out on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do ([**Read here for more)**](https://internetfreedom.in/statement-scary-disclosures-on-use-of-nso-spyware-in-india-signal-a-need-for-urgent-remedy/).  In brief, relying on spyware supplied by an Israeli cyber-intelligence firm, which was installed through a missed call on Whatsapp after which an attacker would gain complete access to a smartphone, individuals in India were found to have been targetted.

### Specific asks of the Committee

Our representation covered the lack of legality, the violation of privacy and the unavailability to remedy, as we did with the Committee on Home Affairs. However, the most significant of the asks we made of the Committee lies in the request that the victims of the hacking be given the stage to provide testimonials before the Committees. A number of these individuals have even put out a statement asking the Government to reveal information on the issue ([**read here for more**](https://countercurrents.org/2019/11/open-letter-to-the-government-of-india-from-pegasus-targeted-persons)). It is important that these first hand human experiences be provided to fully demonstrate the patently criminal surveillance they have been subjected to.

In light of all of this, here's an interesting titbit, Isreali law requires that an export permit is granted for the sale of this software ([**there's a whole licensing process**](https://www.novalpina.pe/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Legal-Opinion.pdf)), therefore, the software supplied by the NSO Group is regulated under this. So, we thought it was important for the Committee to consider inviting the Israeli government to appear before the them to shed some light. Further, [**in Facebook's civil complaint**](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/whatsapp-snooping-pegasus-documents-show-indian-government-likely-culprit_in_5dbbbd74e4b057bf506fa196) in the California Court, an annexure of a contract between the NSO Group and Ghana indicates that the 'System Provider' which is the NSO Group  shall receive a certificate which would also contain the identity of the 'end user'. This would be particularly interesting information to happen upon in order to establish identity in the attacks in India.

Looking at the bigger picture, we did touch upon broader concerns of India cyber-security with these suggestions for consideration.

* **Need for updation:** India’s National Cybersecurity Policy has not seen any amendments since 2013 and while the new National Cybersecurity Coordinator has indicated that his office is seeking to ensure India has a new Cybersecurity Strategy in 2020, Parliament must act to ensure that this is openly consulted on, drawing on inputs from security researchers and other Indians who can provide their expertise to ensure a stronger National Cybersecurity Strategy that has widespread public support and awareness.
* **Lack of guidance:** The time for a permanent advisory body is now more than ever. There is need for continuous counsel on matters of advancing technology and we have encouraged the Committee to ask the Government on how it can form a standing Digital Security Advisory body with stakeholders beyond civil servants, particularly as existing statutory bodies such as the Cyber Regulation Advisory Committee - mandated by the Information Technology Act - appear to be dormant.

While the heat of these events begins to fade, we hope that the Committee considers our suggestions to ensure it is made fully aware of the incident and its hit to India's cybersecurity.

I am sure that this guy is not joking. If he says he wants to implement it, he will implement it. I guess it was a couple of years ago when he said that BJP will be in power for 25 years at least. I chuckled at the time but it seems like that he will be right. BJP has the support of biggest industrialists who seem to get stronger every day. There’s monopolization. 

Economy is pretty bad but the public seems to have absolutely no concern for it.  Even if the nrc comes I am sure no other religion except Muslims will be treated with suspicion. 

And I see absolutely no way that this can be stopped. If the police comes and drags out a Muslim family from their house, I do not see any of the neighbours belonging to majority community coming to protest. All I see is that they come outside, see the show, maybe say some word like “that’s bad”. If the government decides to go full nazi there’s absolutely nothing that can stop them.

3706,"Rant: Struggling to overcome the usual quarter-life crisisI'm a 31 y/o single guy, working with this small software company for about 5 years. And I recently moved to their foreign office. It's a really small company (less than 15 people). Colleagues are nice, friendly and all that. But heck! Everyday I just can't wait to go back home. The job is super boring, I've been doing this for so long and after a point, it just becomes mechanical. It’s the same product, tech stack and I hardly learn anything new. Even when there is an opportunity to learn something new, I just don’t. I always pick the least creative solution. There is absolutely no motivation, other than the money. And the fact that I can't quit and go back to India. I come in everyday, take twice the time required to finish a task. It's gotten so worse that I allocate procrastination time to my task estimate. Sometimes my manager is surprised I spent 5 days on a simple 1-day task. But I can say with confidence that my employer is happy with my performance. My colleagues are friendly people but I've started to dislike them, mostly because there is always work coming in, and I often feel unappreciated. Everyday is a struggle to push myself, organize my thoughts and act on them. I even started to come to work early, so I can leave early.  

I really love being at home, I cook, stream something online and maybe have a beer or two. Or go out and explore a new place. I wait desperately for the weekend and I use the two days to recuperate and prepare myself for the difficult week ahead. Quite evenings and weekends is the only part of my life that's keeping me sane. 

To make matters worse, I have this tendency of contemplating conversations I had with my colleagues, think about my family in India or my ex. It's just crazy, I make up these hypothetical situations in my head and think about ways to address them. And I do it rather obsessively. For instance, the other day I was day dreaming about my ex visiting me. I was planning out the day in my head: picking her up from the airport, I would wear something sharp and fashionable. Cook her dinner and she'd be amazed by my cooking skills. This is a harmless happy enactment. But shit gets a lot darker. Lately, this has started to impact my sleep. Since 4 months, I wake up at 2 in the midnight and just can't go back to sleep. So I'm up staring at the ceiling thinking and drawing shit situations in my head. Restlessly waiting for the clock to tick Friday, until it's time to pick myself up, leave my motivation at the door and head to my apathetic job that I can't quit.  

Thank you for reading, have a nice day!",1574329445.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,24,53
3707,"Out education system sucks.Again, its been about a year since I posted a rant on this sub on the very same topic. And again, it's starting to get on my nerves. I'm an (ex)NRI who used to live in the US for about 6 years. While my view on this is a bit different on this than most Indians, I'm pretty sure most people feel the same.

&#x200B;

   The problem is not entirely with the education system itself, but with the Indian people, teachers, students and parents. No matter what CBSE/ICSE/SSC tries to do to improve it, the culture surrounding education is to blame. Kids are taught from a young age that life is a competition-- which it is but not to the extent we are taught. It's not uncommon to see parents comparing children as small as 4th or 5th graders. Lines like ""If you don't study, you'll become a beggar"" aren't uncommon, even for 7 year olds.

&#x200B;

The submissive culture to teachers is also a big problem. While it makes theoretical sense to follow teachers-- after all, they're (usually) wiser and (usually) look out for the best interests of the student, this is almost always not the case. There are many good teachers who let kids be independent, but most of the people who end up becoming a teacher have no interest in teaching, and don't know how, and just act like an organic audio book. I know only a handful of teachers who aren't like this in my school.

&#x200B;

And then there's the actual education part. The class English topper was a boy who couldn't hold a conversation properly. There's a big difference between education and training. For example, the last math exam I had, I lost points because I use csc(x) instead of cosec(x). Again, any half decent math teacher would know they're the same thing (and mine did), but it's still somehow wrong, I also lost points in english because I used the ampersand (the & symbol) instead of writing and. Again-- any semi-literate English teacher would know that that means. And computer... I have been programming since I was 10, so I know my way around a few languages. But again, the class topper is someone who needs to search for letter keys and struggles to write any code outside of whats given in the textbook.

&#x200B;

  There is also the problem for testing. WHAT THE FUCK IS CBSE SMOKING?????

The SA system used to be good. But no, they realized they actually fixed something, which is a big no-no. Now, its back to the old rat race.

The next morning I wake up with a sense of dread and no recollection of what happened the previous night. I get to work and my colleagues tell me to take the day off. Apparently I was inappropriate with a lot of my female colleagues at the party, and two of them have filed complaints to HR. HR called me to ask for my perspective, however I don't have much of a perspective as I was unconscious for most of the party. So is this it? Have I fucked my life up?

TLDR: I got hammered and misbehaved with my female colleagues. Is my career over?",1574256768.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,20,52

My credit card was credited the full amount today, but the available balance only rose by 1/4th the refund amount.

Contacted by bank (HDFC) and they say that the full refund will only be returned to me in 3 days...

How can they show a credit to my account on my statement but not make the balance available?

It was an EMI payment. From my understanding, an EMI payment takes the full amount from your credit card, then after 3-4 working days returns the amount minus the EMI charge. Its been 3 working days since I made the payment, no EMI refund and no outright refund for product that was cancelled is reflecting in my account.

when asked if the government uses the Pegasus exploit to tap WhatsApp calls, the government gave a vague answer that it has the power to intercept, monitor and decrypt all communications in interests of ""national security""

To which my friend said:
> The government should have this power and we have to nothing to fear because we have nothing to hide.

The amount of times I've heard this argument is honestly worrying and incredibly naive. This puts the seeds for an orwellian dystopian future where everyone is under constant mass surveillance.

As Edward Snowden says
>""Saying you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you nothing to say"" - Edward Snowden

Privacy isn't about hiding something. Its about protecting something. 

Allowing them to invade our private lives just gives them unlimited power over us. They know every communication ever done. This just puts them at a position where they are the all seeing big boss eye.

You think the government wouldn't be interested in using this power to its advantage? They have the power to know what every journalist or reporter is talking about. They can easily target anyone and stop their scandals from being reported.

This statement of ""national security"" is so vague because *everything is a threat to national security*. Shoes are a threat a national security because criminals use it to run from the police. Why not ban shoes then?

The Constitution knew about this and this is why it requires the government to get a warrant from the court before they even begin to invade people's privacy. Paradoxically, the Constitution makes it harder for the government to enfore everything because it knew this gives the government too much power over people.


Privacy is the last line defending our freedom.

(This is just a question. Not assertion.)

In our world, high trust between humans could be the reason why some countries rank high on HDI.

Amongst Indian states, I felt this could be the reason.

Kerala - Can not comment much about it, but I know this state is left leaning which is a good thing.

Goa - The Christianity in this state might have spread idea of helping other human beings, which the religion is quite famous for.

Himachal Pradesh - We all are aware of the love, simplicity and affection these hill people are famous for

Sikkim - Message of peace spread by Buddhism could be a reason. Also, Its a hilly state, like HP.

Punjab - The people of this state have a background of struggle for human rights. Struggles of Sikhs led by Guru Gobind Singh and Baba Banda Singh Bahadur are some examples. These religious institutions of the Sikhs called Gurudwaras are known for giving basic needs like food and shelter for free.


So I am curious. Maybe the reason for all these rankings is a high level of trust and willingness to help others present in the humans of these states?

Edit 1: Just realized that All these 5 states are small in size so maybe that is the real reason, not the the social culture.  North Eastern states are also small and they are very close in the top rankings. I think size of an administrative region plays a more important role.",1574284156.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,22,32

I am the primary tenant of a Nestaway property, I have been living there for past 10 months.The entire flat was on my name as I transferred Rs. 1,28,000 from Nestaway app. Also I got two people on board to share the flat with me & got them added as co-tenants in the rent agreement. I recently decided to shift.

As a result of which Nestaway said that if I move out then the other co-tenants will have to move out as well, because the agreement is on my name. After a month of discussion Nestaway finally came to a conclusion that if the co-tenants want to stay in that property they will have pay me my share of security deposit and then I can put up an email saying that Nestaway doesn’t owe me anything and my account can be transferred to one of the other co-tenants.

Instead of doing this, the area manager Prem with two of my other co-tenants(Mellisa & Shruti) conspired against me and deleted & cleared all the records from Nestaway app, including deposit & monthly transactional details from my Nestaway account through backend and might have probably divided my security deposit among themselves.

I found out that my account was actually handed over to Mellisa without my permission. And on Nestaway records it now says that she is the one who has been staying there for past 10 months.

I have tried reaching out to Nestaway for help but they have refused to reinstate my account as the area manager Mr.Prem seem to be in cahoots with the property manager.

I wish I knew about their reviews beforehand. I have come into contact with various other people using services of Nestaway, and after hearing about their rampant fraudulent practices from customers across the country , I am really concerned that I am going to lose my hard earned money. 

I have had bad experiences with other companies as well but this is something unprecedented for me that my app data including all the transaction listings, my KYC , my bank account details and other profile details were removed from my account with the help of backend team as if I never used Nestaway in my life. 

I just wish this message reaches a wider audience, as I believe companies like Nestaway should know that they cannot harass their tenants after taking hard earned money from them & continue to thrive. 

I have various proofs including transaction details, mails, call recordings etc to support claims made by me.",1574254388.0,#ea0027,Unverified,light,31,208

3930,"GUYS I NEED HELP !!! Debt advice!!I don't know much about running a business.My father has mortgaged our house to finance his business and has taken out a loan close to a crore, to get it running. This has induced a lost of paranoia in the house as my mom thinks that she has been made the Co applicant in the loan and is afraid that if the business fails she will lose all her retirement benefits.   My father claims that she is not the co applicant since it's a mortgage loan and she signed in a paper where it said that she won't lay any claim to the property. I keep asking my dad to show her the papers but he bypasses it somehow and when I say that we will go and speak to the bank manager about this he says that it might affect his relationship with the bank and the loan might not get renewed and it means the end of his business. He has recently invested in two different business in the last 4 months which are yet to generate considerable profits. Now he is asking me to be a co applicant in 25 lakh rupees loan for another business which he says he will get back the money in a week. But you see before i step into this mess i want to know what is what and this time Im willing to trust only real figures and official papers. But i dont know how to. So the things I want to know.

1)What are the financial liabilities of my mom in relation to my dad's business?

2)How do i know a)The current state of my dad's business? b)How much debt has he incurred?

3) How effectively is the loan money is being used?

Now that the exam is around the corner, I feel absolutely no confidence at all. In fact, I would say I'm downright anxious/depressed thinking about how it's going to go. It's pretty much pointless if I don't score above a 95 percentile and get into a good college and I don't feel like I'm going to score anywhere near that this year. In retrospect, I think I could have prepared in a smarter more efficient way.

For all those who didn't clear CAT in the first attempt, did you find it worth your while to give it another go? Did the gap you took negatively impact your job prospects after?

https://preview.redd.it/y44ghg8sxsz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=18057b8e865ca01e560b64154b83e737d65dc791

### Tl;dr

In the ongoing hearings before the Supreme Court, senior advocates for the Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) argued against the severe communication and movement restrictions imposed in Kashmir. Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi appearing on behalf of IJU compared the government’s stance in the present case to the infamous majority decision in *ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla* during the Emergency. He further urged the Court to consider the proportionality of the restrictions and whether they were narrowly tailored and the least restrictive alternative available to the government. Mr. Dushyant Dave appearing for the Foundation for Media Professionals extensively cited the Constituent Assembly Debates to emphasize the Supreme Court’s role as the guardian of fundamental rights against executive action which always favours social control over individual liberty. He also relied upon a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telcom Policy 2012 to argue that in a digitized world where internet connectivity is necessary to access essential services, access to the internet is a fundamental right.  


### ADM Jabalpur: The sequel no one wants to watch

Mr. Huzefa Ahmadi, the Senior Advocate appearing for IJU, began his arguments yesterday by referring to the infamous majority decision in *ADM Jabalpur v. Shivkant Shukla* which is widely considered to be the darkest hour in the Supreme Court’s history. He drew parallels between the government’s affidavit and the majority reasoning in *ADM Jabalpur* which left fundamental rights at the mercy of executive benevolence. Interestingly, the arguments were happening in Court No. 2 where a portrait of the sole dissenting judge in *ADM Jabalpur*, Justice HR Khanna hangs on the walls.

Mr. Ahmadi then proceeded to explain that orders under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure can be passed only if there is genuine apprehension of public disorder based on material facts relating to a specific area. For instance, the government could issue orders under Section 144 for certain districts which are especially volatile but it cannot impose blanket restrictions throughout the state. He explained that security concerns would vary depending on various factors such as whether a district is close to the border etc. and the government should assess the situation in each district individually and provide specific reasons.

While discussing proportionality, Mr. Ahmadi cited the 5 judge bench decision in *KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India* which struck down mandatory linking of Aadhaar with bank accounts because such a requirement presumed that everyone was a money launderer. In *KS Puttaswamy*, the Supreme Court had held that *“a mere ritualistic incantation of money laundering and black money”* would not satisfy the proportionality test and justify mandatory Aadhar linkage if there were other KYC methods available. Similarly, in this case, the government could not merely cite vague national security concerns to justify such prolonged and severe restrictions on an entire population.  


### Who will save us from becoming a police state if not the judiciary?

Mr. Dushyant Dave, the Senior Advocate appearing for FMP, started by noting that the government had treated this case in a cavalier manner and caused significant delay despite the fundamental rights of millions of citizens being at stake. The Court then cautioned the government that the Solicitor General would have to argue as soon as the intervenors finish and no further adjournment would be granted.

Mr. Dave began by quoting from an Israeli Supreme Court decision where the judges held that enhanced interrogation techniques were not permissible in a democracy even if this means that the government must fight terrorism with one hand tied behind its back. In a democractic set-up, the government cannot resort to the same kind of tactics that terrorists do, and if such an attempt is made, it is the duty of the judiciary to strike it down. Mr. Dave then extensively quoted from the Constituent Assembly Debates to explain how the framers intended the Supreme Court to act as a bulwark against the excesses of the executive branch which is always more concerned about social control than individual liberty.

Mr. Dave further argued that the government has imposed the communication shutdown and movement restrictions to prevent people from voicing their protest against the abrogation of Article 370. He then cited the recent Hong Kong High Court decision which struck down an anti-face mask measure as disproportionate despite violent demonstrations having taken place. He cautioned the Court against accepting the government’s vague arguments about national security which lack any material basis because it would set a dangerous precedent. He argued that similar restrictions could next be imposed in states with high Naxalite presence and the Court must intervene to prevent India from becoming a police state.

Mr. Dave cited several cases to establish that the fundamental right to life under Article 21 must be interpreted broadly to include the right to access the internet. He relied upon a recent Kerala High Court decision and the National Telcom Policy 2012 to argue that in a digitized world, internet connectivity is a basic need like health or education. He concluded his arguments by asking the Court to evaluate the restrictions based on the situation prevailing in Kashmir in August, and not in November when some of the restrictions have been eased. He also criticised the government’s practice of submitting material evidence in sealed covers because petitioners can never meet a case they do not know.

4083,"Hotstar is censoring anything remotely against Disney, even jokes!So I observed this yesterday while watching John Oliver's Last week tonight on hotstar. He makes jokes on Disney(He jokes on many people, corporations anyway). I observed a cut in scene and suspected a censorship. Immediately went to YouTube and watched that particular segment, which clearly didn't have anything censored. This was a particular recurring scene where he says ""Disney Facts"" over a set of jokes.

Hotstar is doing this even after being paid for a premium subscription. Similar censorship has happened in the past after Disney acquisition.

Edit : 
This blew up more than I thought it would. NDTV published an article on this reddit post. Hope hotstar stops censoring. Great going guys!

Few ideas I considered

1. Food processing- making unique products (processing exotic veggies and fruits, making premium meat and fish products) by employing laborers and not using expensive machines.
2. Trading electronics with value addition- getting unique products from china and selling/distributing with assured quality and service (kind of like what Boat did with its headphones in 2016).
3. Distributorship of fmcg products
4. Small manufacturing of customized products like iron grills, furniture etc for the premium segment
5. Exporting- many indian products are in high demand outside and can be exported.

Not interested in making digital products and aspiring for VC funds because I don't have a lot of exposure to that sector. Looking for traditional businesses that can be grown organically over the years- kind of like what the gujjus and marwaris do to start off. If the investment is inadequate then feel free to mention the required investment. I'm saving up from a job and will  seek to start out after 1-2 years.

4176,"What is the scope for work and careers without a college degree in India? and more advice needed...I want to drop out of college (Electronics and Communications Engineering) to pursue a more independent path. I'm not able to put up with the college rules, and a not so modest number of other flaws(both personal, and college related). I'm trying to work my way around them, but I wanted to weigh my options anyway. 

How's the freelance game in India? Assuming that I'll work hard and have the acumen to develop the required skill, can I look for a stable, and decently well paying career even without a formal degree? How long might this take to build? What fields provide the best opportunities for said path? Or are there things that I can acquire only by studying at university? 
The plan is to use the 2-3 years that I save by dropping out by working on my interests, taking technical courses online, working part time etc.
A lot of this effort is needed in addition to college even if I continued anyway, to acquire the necessary skills because the stuff that's taught at colleges will not suffice. At least by dropping out, I can work things out at my own pace and choose from what I'm genuinely interested in. 
In addition to this, there is also a whole other path where I want to travel, vlog, do some culinary stuff, small technical projects that contribute to the society, etc...and eventually work on a start-up once I know what I want to do. 
Again, dropping out of college will give me the freedom to do all of these, whilst also giving me a good 2-3 years to build rapport. 

All this probably sounds very naive and utopian, but that is exactly why I wanted to get insights from people in the respective fields. And if not now, maybe 5 years down the line, this career path won't be so uncommon perhaps?

Also, do the established corporations hire people without a degree, based on pure skill? Or is it just the startups? Or nobody? 

Any other indirect inferences, and suggestions are welcome too.

recently I bought a dash cam from bangood on discount and it had Custom insurance (i.e. in case custom duty is levied they will refund it).

Now, my claim is getting denied by Banggood because the tracking number of parcel in not mentioned on the receipt. When I checked with the local post office, they said they don't provide receipts and we should have taken photo of paper in the postman's hand. 


Now I am not able to find there contact details. The only lead I can see is this Blogspot page. But I don't think our **Customs** would be using gmail for official purpose.

4292,"Anxious first-time car buyer needs advice: Should I buy a pre-owned car which is hypothecated without knowing the owner?First time car buyer here based out of Mumbai. 

Slightly longish context but I am an anxious first time buyer, so I appreciate you taking time out to read through the post.

I saw an advertisement in my housing society's telegram group regarding a car someone wants to sell. It seems to be a distress sale - the owner is moving to another country for good in January and wishes to sell his current vehicle before he moves out. The car seems to be in excellent condition, is less than a year old and has seen about 5000 kms. The price, while high at the outset, is something that I am confident can be brought down to make this a very attractive proposition. Here is my quandry -

- The car seems to be hypothecated to a bank and seems to be registered to the owner's company. While I have no issues with this per se, I am a bit concerned about how the whole registration transfer process will play out, especially given that the owner will leave the country in a month or so. 
- Also, since the owner did not tell me this fact upfront (the hypothecation issue came to light only after I did a casual search to cover all bases), I wonder whether the seller can be trusted to make a deal in good faith.
- I suspect that the owner wants to use my money to pay back the loan amount, and hence is expecting to receive the money in full before he can initiate transfer formalities.
- I do not know the owner personally. He seems to have arrived earlier this year and is currently living on rent - once he moves out, it will be difficult to hold him accountable should anything go wrong with the car or the payment. I am concerned that once I pay the owner, there is a very real chance that he may disappear with the cash
- Whom should I make payment to? Should I pay the seller, or should I insist on paying the company (which is mentioned as the 'owner' in the RC book)
- Is there any alternative payment mechanism that you recommend - I would like to avoid a situation wherein I've paid the whole amount and the seller dilly-dallies/disappears.
- What happens to the resale value in case of company owned vehicles? Once the hypothecation is cleared, does the car get directly registered to me or does it usually get registered under the sellers name, and then to me (making me the 3rd owner driving down the resale value)?
- How much time on avg. will the resale process take end-to-end? Can this be done till the seller leaves in Jan?
- Anything else I should be aware of?

Hoping you folks can help me out since I virtually have zero experience in buying vehicles and this will be the largest transaction I have made till date. This should also help others who are in the same boat as me so I really appreciate your efforts!",1574154505.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,11

4363,"Wife filed 498A case because I wanted divorce after finding out about her affairHi All,

Posting from a throwaway account. I will summarize my situation, please guide me on how to fight this injustice.

I live in US and we had an arranged marriage 3 yrs ago. Fast forward to 8months ago, I found texts from a guy proposing to my wife. After some ugly arguments, she involved her family and things got uglier. So I suggested we go to counselling so that we can get a neutral answer. She didn't like the counsellor's initial assessment and refused to do counselling.

We decided to go for mutual divorce as the marriage pretty much fell apart then. But now, they are demanding 80lakh amount and filed a 498a against me and my family. She also accused me of a lot of other stuff like domestic violence, mental harassment etc.

I have proofs of her chat with the guy (seems like the only smart thing I did in this fucked up situation). I am confident that I can prove my innocence. Anyone familiar with this process, will I get a chance to prove my innocence against her accusations during the process. Like will there be a character assessment or something like that during this where they try to see if what each person says is true or not?

https://preview.redd.it/d72pn1hu0lz31.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=4991e7d0a5538ee0d02b5efbffb901dcb86ffd34

## Tl;dr

The DNA Bill is back. The DNA Bill aims to regulate the use and outputs of DNA technology in certain cases and has been the subject of many a debate. It was introduced once again in July 2019 in the Lok Sabha after having lapsed in 2018. It was then referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change on October 18.  The Committee invited comments on the Bill till November 18 and oh, did we have a lot of comments.

## What's it all about?

India has been attempting to introduce legislation that regulates DNA technology since the early 2000's but thankfully has been largely unsuccessful until recently, making our fears quite real. The current DNA Technology (Use and Application) Regulation Bill, 2019 has seen a number of redrafts bringing it to its present form and yet continues to be problematic.

We're grateful to be able to voice these concerns as the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate Change has invited comments on the Bill after it was referred to them. Unfortunately, as submissions made cannot be fully public prior to the Committee publishing their report, so we highlight our major concerns to give you an understanding of why we think the DNA Bill not only needs to undergo further work but also needs to be introduced only after a solid data protection law is in place.

## A few of our very many concerns

* *No data protection legislative framework*: With no overarching data protection legislation in India, the lack of obligation within the Bill to ensure protection especially by the DNA Laboratory as a either mere collectors or even processors of the DNA collected, have no alternative safeguards in place to remedy data breaches or ensure informed consent. Similarly, there is nothing to govern the sharing of such sensitive data, ensuring purpose limitation is maintained.
* *Profiling and surveillance:* DNA profiles can reveal extremely sensitive information about an individual such as their skin colour, illness, susceptibility to diseases and any access to such intrusive information can be misused to specifically target individuals with their own genetic data and is particularly worrying as it could be used to incorrectly link a particular caste/community to criminal activities. Further, in the event that such a databases are then linked to others worrying databases in existence, it is bound to give rise to Government conducted mass surveillance.
* *Overbroad provisions:* Our submission tackles the lack of legitimate use by the Bill; it indicates that DNA technology intends to be used for extremely wide criminal and civil purposes (**alarm bells are ringing**). We argue that the Bill as such extensive databasing of DNA data requires to meet the conditions set by the Supreme Court's judgement in Puttaswamy of which one is a greater public purpose, the databasing of DNA used in civil cases does not fulfill this criteria. Further, even within criminal cases, there is need to limit the collection of DNA to the investigation and prosecution of cognizable crimes to ensure the data in the DNA database is minimal and controlled.

The submission details a plethora of other concerns ranging from lack of privacy safeguards such as no informed consent, storage and sharing of information and the power of the DNA profiling board.

We are grateful that the Committee has invited non-official witnesses/experts to provide their views on November 27 and hope that both written and oral submissions that come their way will be taken into strong consideration, resulting in the suggestion of a much required revising of the Bill.

4442,"Just came back from my first trip to India and loved it!I should start off with a big thank you to the country of India and its people. My friend and I just came back from our first (and hopefully not last) visit to your country. In one word, we found it fascinating. Loved loved loved our trip overall. In many ways, it's so different from my own country (Canada) but there are always universal similarities.

We flew into Delhi right during the worst of the air pollution. Despite possibly sacrificing a few days of my lifespan, we saw a good number of attractions in south and central Delhi. The Qutub Minar was stunning, as was the Lodhi Gardens. The touts weren't nearly as bad as I thought. It was mostly just tuk tuk drivers waiting outside the Metro stations looking for customers. On a related note, Delhi's Metro system is really fast, cheap and efficient! It was certainly a different experience having my bag x-rayed and being patted down for every trip, but I guess you guys have heightened security concerns.

Then we took an overnight train to Jodhpur. I gotta say that Old Delhi Railway Station is a nightmare to navigate (no indicators on the platforms to indicate where each carriage stops and virtually no one to ask), but we eventually figured it out. We ended up taking five train journeys during our trip and miraculously, all five of them arrived on time. We rode either First AC or Chair Car for all of them and they were perfectly fine.

Jodhpur is a beautiful city. Mehrangarh Fort and wandering the neighbourhoods with the blue-painted homes was a real treat.

Next was Jaipur, which was a bigger city, but had a lot of neat things to see. Amer Fort was a real highlight. By this point, we had gotten used to all the honking and general traffic chaos. You guys really like using your horns but never using your turn signals!

Sawai Madhopur/Ranthambore NP was next. The town itself had nothing of note to see, but wedding season had apparently kicked off, so there were some really colourful processions and wedding receptions at night. Ranthambore Fort was probably my favourite fort that I saw on this trip. We were even lucky enough to see a pair of tigers during one of our game drives in the park.

Agra was next up on the list. Agra Fort and the Baby Taj were nice to visit, but of course the Taj Mahal was the highlight. What a stunning and astonishingly beautiful building. We even found the secret sunset spot the night before to see it. Agra itself didn't seem to have much to offer and was very dusty.

Varanasi was probably our favourite city on this trip. I'm not a religious person, but to be in a place with so much piety and faith was very moving. The ghats are almost magical. Serious question though: do the locals not get sick from constantly bathing in such dirty water?

Happy to say that we managed not to fall for any scams while in India. I researched them ahead of time and other than paying a bit more for tuk tuks than a local would (which is unavoidable), we did really well. Uber worked in most of the cities, which was a real godsend. I was also amazed that Google Maps was remarkably accurate, even in the labyrinthine alleys of Varanasi and Jodhpur. We were however really surprised by how many stray dogs there are in your country. They were everywhere, which was sad to see.

Fantastic and very well-priced food everywhere we went, so that was great. Overall, we just loved what we saw and would definitely go back one day and see other parts of the country. India seems to work in a perpetual state of organized chaos. It shouldn't work, but it just seems to keep chugging on.",1574107736.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,16,93

Now after numerous back and forth for scanning documents among A, B and C counters, the C counter officer tells me that police verification will be carried out. 

This when I endorsed my wife's name on my passport just a while ago. I tried to reason with the officer that I've read the policy/FAQ however this guy is adamant. At this point I was fuming and he suggested we both check with the APO. 

He gave some vague reason that wife has maiden name in her passport. The APO also agreed with him stating that C guy is the authority and his decision matters no matter what. Basically code for""fuck you that's why"".
I reiterated that according to the website either parent should have a passport with spouse name endorsed. I had to give in. 

Why the heck do I get my passport reissued when verification is supposed to take place in any case!

I would very much like to visit a place with old forest and abundant wildlife. I would ideally like to travel somewhere in South India, as that is where my family comes from (I was born in Australia and have never visited India). I'd like to avoid ""touristy"" places, but I know my five year old will refuse to use a pit/drop toilet so having a home base where we can use western flush toilets would be excellent too.

4644,"Thank you, India.I've been having a hard time in my personal life lately, and for some reason I found myself thinking a lot about the time I spent in India. It has been a few years, and I've traveled to other places since, but lately memories from India have helped me stay strong.

Whether it be strolling in the ancient ruins around Hampi, Karnatka, climbing giant boulders and feeling like the king of the world;

Or drifting in the crazy haze of Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, feeling the insane energy of life and death strip me of my identity, as I become just another body in the crowd;

Watching the mists roll over the tea plantations in Munnar, Kerala, the light rain on my skin, and feeling inner peace;

Not being able to smile for my photo in front of the Taj Mahal, because I was overcome by beauty and grief;

Climbing to the top of the crowded waterfall in Bhagsu, Himachal Pradesh, and suddenly finding myself Isolated in a beautiful stream, alone save a solitary monk taking a bath in one of the pools;

walking around giant temple complexes in Tamil Nadu, Marveling at the dedication and power of their builders;

Being escorted by a friendly dog half way to the Kheerganga hot springs in Parvati valley, her patiently waiting for me every time I have to slow down;

Getting tremendous help from like 500 different beautiful people whenever I needed something, all over this country;

And finally, quietly sitting in the meditation room in the Buddha memorial park in Patna, Bihar, and finally accepting that it's time to go back home.


Thank you, India. Thank you for all these memories, and a thousand more. I love you and I miss you. Stay the crazy, unique, powerful, beautiful, **wonderful** place that you are.

4645,"Can our relationship survive? Me( 30M Indian) and my girlfriend(49F white american). Relationship advice please.When I was working in US, I met my current girlfriend. She was married to a guy in her 20s but they divorced due to his abusive nature. She got scared of relationships since then. At first, she wasn't that comfortable with being in a relationship with me as she thought I wanted to marry her just for GC. It took a lot of convincing and in the end, we were together but I hadn't told anyone, not even my parents about this relationship as she was quite older than me.
Due to some misunderstanding, we parted ways and I came back to India. I quit my job and started freelancing. Then I founded a small company here in Mumbai and everything is going pretty good. She contacted me again, cleared the misunderstanding and we got back together. We both try to visit each other every month and spend some together. 
Is it possible for us to be together? I cannot move to US because that would mean shutting down my company and working again under a manager. 
She can move back to India but that would mean she would have to start her career here from the bottom. She's almost at a retirement age. It would take a lot of convincing for my mom but my dad is fine with the relationship. He still has his qualms but he doesn't mind.
What I'm feeling guilty about is that she'll have to compromise her career to come live with me. It feels like I'm an asshole for not doing the same for her. She has said that she's ready to live with me in Mumbai.

We both love each other a lot but we cannot be together unless one of us sacrifices their career. I fear that if she leaves her job, it would create resentment in her mind towards me. 

Regarding taunts from neighbours, I doubt that anyone cares here. I have seen people in their mid-40s getting married and no one says anything. Maybe they'll gossip between themselves but I don't care. 

Does it create resentment? I have asked her about it but she says she's ready to work again even if in the beginning, she would earn peanuts here. In US, she earns about $70k.

Another problem I'm facing is that we both want kids. She's fine with having kids but not on an ecstatic level but I do want them. Is it possible to have kids when someone is at 50?",1574079277.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,14
4646,"The media coverage of the JNU situation is shamefulIts no surprise, as Indian news media has for quite some time been a shallow, biased mouthpiece pushing whatever agenda they have and have zero regard for balanced, fair coverage - its reality tv disguised as news. This goes for pretty much all the news channels.

To someone watching the news or even reading this sub they'd think JNU is full of rich wankers who eat Rs200 thalis and Rs30 egg rolls and the entirety of the coverage has been about how 'entitled' the students are, vandalizing property, not respecting police etc etc etc. Endless coverage and debates and yet no one covers the simple facts - 26% of students have a family income < 6k, \~45% less than 10k, the VC refuses to meet students, there are plenty of other issues such as curfews, dress codes etc that are being protested. And on top of it all, the bigger issue is that higher education \*should\* be subsidized esp in a poor nation like ours which also claims to be a socialist country. Instead an agenda is being pushed by the media that students are vandals, education is not a right, they should just take out loans etc - instead of asking why other institutions don't have subsidies similar to JNU.

Again its no surprise. No issue of any significance is debated and discussed its just a pass the blame media circus for a few weeks and then the issue is forgotten. Another e.g. is the water report - keep fighting and blaming each other instead of actually trying to fix the issue.",1574062671.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,41,87

4661,"All the gym goers of r/India, DO NOT follow your gym trainer's advice blindly.I have been to many commercial gyms in India and what I have seen in most of the gym is that the trainers do not have any clue whatsoever how to perform basic exercises correctly. They will just shout cues at your face like ""keep your back straight"" or ""brace core"" but they won't tell you how to do that. For instance I saw a guy doing bench press with his trainer who was also the head trainer at that gym and that trainer didn't tell him to retract his scapula, performing bench press without retracting your scapula will fuck up your shoulders. The next day, that guy was complaining to his trainer that his right shoulder hurt for some reason and I told him exactly why they hurt. That's just one case, I have seen it happening so many times. I suggest you guys to do your own research and learn correct form to perform each exercise. Do NOT just add another exercise in your routine just because your trainer tells you to do it, pick 5-6 exercises and get better at them. Exercises like Deadlift, Squats, Pull Ups, Rows, OHP, Bench Press is all you need. Start with an empty barbell first and increase the weight by 2.5kg weekly. Search for Alan Thrall and Brian Alsruhe on YouTube to learn the correct form. Stay away from Smith Machine as much as you can, they will fuck up your joints.

*November 18, 2019*

*Several Army jawans are stuck under snow after an avalanche hit an Army post in the Siachen Glacier, Army sources have said. The avalanche hit the Army position in the northern glacier at around 3:30 pm on Monday.*

*The Army troops have begun the rescue and recovery operations.*

*Army sources have said that a total of eight Army personnel hit by the avalanche were part of a patrolling party. The Army personnel were in the Siachen Glacier when the incident happened.*

*The avalanche had taken place in the Northern Glacier where the altitude is around 18,000 feet and above.*

*In February this year, 10 Army jawans got trapped under 35 feet of snow after a wall of ice came crashing down on them at the Siachen Glacier.*

*A team of 150 Army men, including a group specialised in glaciated terrain, rushed to the site for an around-the-clock rescue operation.*

*After hours of the excruciating rescue operation in the extreme weather, the rescue team found Lance Naik Hanumanthappa Koppad. He was buried under a thick bed of ice at 19,500 feet at the Siachen Glacier.*

But she kept on calling me again and again and it  got me irritated and  told her politely that she is being watched by my lead A and doesn't look good if she keeps calling me for help.
Days passed by and don't when but that lady told her team lead B that my lead A asked me not to help her out.
Now that team lead B is discussing about that with me I was completely blank on what to answer! I just kept quiet.
I am worried that this discussion will somehow reach my lead A and spoil my rapo with him.

He did his btech electrical from some unknown engg college (prob donation), post that did a 2 year course from npti.

Anyway log story short he has never cleared any job interview and has never worked a day in his life (29+ now).

Now he keeps playing online games all day and has made some really bad friends who are trying to involve him into many shady business ventures (read scams) and he has also taken some small loans from loan sharks, who are pestering his parents now.

Is there any way I can help him? Because he does seem to listen to me afterall, but I'm unsure of the advice I can give him. 

Should I suggest carrer counselling to him? Or should he do an MBA or some other course first? Father suggests that he should be studying for some civil services exams but I don't really see how he is ever going to clear that. 

I'm a software consultant so I'm bit a of ""kua ka mendak"" in that regards and know of no other options besides doing some computer course like ccna, which he is unwilling to do (he has no aptitude for programming, etc)

Anyway, do you guys have any advice to give him? What should someone with his age and qualifications do?",1574067206.0,,,dark,17,19

Somethings that bother me,

It seems it started in good sense where Himesh got someone talendted and groomed her. But then media has made living God out of her like they did to Taimur. Every action of her is justified, stuff that hasn't happened is posted as news. But then again it is our media, what's the point of complaining.

But I am thinking of people, they complain against nepotism. But then when someone got their glory (credits Himesh) they don't leave opportunity of trolling her. It's like gold mine for memers.

&#x200B;

I still don't get the whole deal. Not a big follower of filmy gossip or tabloids, but I think this Ranu Mandal trend is worse than what Taimur had back few years ago.",1574045469.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,31,33

4848,"I am reading Shiksha by Manish Sisodia and would like to quote one of the biggest problem he believes to exist in current education model in IndiaI quote from his book

""In economics, Adam Smith’s words—limited resources and unlimited wants—have proven lethal. Regardless of the context, these words have left an everlasting impression on the mind of an average literate person, someone who has had twenty years of regular education. Even if we have not studied economics formally, this thought can create doubts in the mind of any person. It then becomes valid for this person to gather unlimited resources for his/her unlimited wants.

In the course of one’s education, at no level is this question asked: Are wants really unlimited? There has not even been an attempt to draw up a list of wants to understand them in any college or school. That is the reason why every person is convinced that their wants are unlimited. To fulfil these unlimited wants, he gets into the rat race to collect unlimited wealth. It is a proven fact that nobody can collect unlimited resources or wealth just through hard work or honesty. For that, he has to adopt dishonest ways—cheat and exploit people. It is certain that when this happens, the person on whom this dishonesty is unleashed, who is cheated on, who is exploited, will not stay quiet. As a reaction, he will either exploit someone else or will protest. In both situations, there will be discord, tension, war and natural disasters. So, if Adam Smith’s words are true then we have to accept that exploitation, discord and war are the way forward. But we are not willing to accept that.

To understand this thought of Adam Smith’s, we need to examine each and every aspect of it and we have to see whether wants are really unlimited. Are some wants limited and some unlimited? Can man’s wants of food, clothing, house, car, mobile phone, TV, etc., not be counted? How much bread, how much clothing, how many houses, how many TVs, how many mobiles would one need in 100 years? Are they unlimited? Are there any boundaries to it and if there are any, then how are they unlimited? Is it our emotional needs that are unlimited? That we understand in terms of words such as respect, security, love. These are also not unlimited but continuous wants. Then, why does this illusion exist? Is it because we usually look for happiness in respect and facilities. Is it possible to identify your needs, understand and get the ability to fulfil them through education? Is it possible to fulfil countable needs through the available means and understand unlimited or continuous needs and fulfil them through education? If not, then what is the use of this education? Is it not important to fix this economic structure to end atrocities and war?


The principle of evolutionary studies: The father of evolutionary studies, Darwin propounded the idea of, ‘survival of the fittest.’ This principle gives rise to a never-ending competition. It creates fear and apprehension. And the fearful person gets busy hoarding everything, person or facility at hand. This is because he fears that if he has to survive, he has to be the fittest. To be the fittest, he can either start working towards becoming the fittest or ensure that nobody else is.


In the same vein, the father of psychology, Freud said that desire was the motive behind all of man’s actions. This also creates an illusion. It makes people consciously or unconsciously slaves of their desires. And then all of society knowingly or unknowingly starts working around this theory. Today, all market practices are based on this theory of desire. No advertisement is complete without a dash of desire, be it to sell a bottle of mango juice, undergarments or perfume.


These three principles of economics, evolutionary thought and psychology get embedded in the minds of those pursuing education even if they don’t study them. In such a situation, it is the responsibility of education to scientifically uproot these three theories from the minds of people. And this needs to be done by education alone. Every child can try and understand his/her own mind during his/her education. They can weigh and choose all aspects of the education that they are receiving. They can understand their gains and losses. They can understand justice, truth and duty.""



""I gained this understanding after meeting Nagraj. That is when I began understanding that there are a lot of issues that we are trying to resolve through laws and protests but their solution can be found in education. As of now, we have limited the aim of education to removing poverty and providing jobs. This is a worldwide problem.""",1574036522.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,26,56

However, getting a job in India is extremely difficult and graduates are paid peanuts even if they get one. They are made to work an insane number of hours every day in difficult conditions with no peace or life outside work just because they are easily replaceable (thanks to the huge supply-demand gap between jobs and job-seekers). No amount of passion towards a subject or job can justify 14-16 hrs workdays full of monotony with barely any money.

In such a case, when someone sees an option during undergrad itself of going for a degree that gives much more money, enhances their quality of work and makes their job more meaningful, why does everyone criticize their move?

After all, India lacks the social security that developed countries have, where an MBA is done only after work experience (because *everyone* there gets a job after undergrad, unlike in India).

### How do I do it?

On iOS and Android, install the 1.1.1.1 app - [Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cloudflare.onedotonedotonedotone&hl=en_GB), [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ae/app/1-1-1-1-faster-internet/id1423538627)

On Windows, Mac and Linux, go to network settings and change to Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) - [instructions](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/docs/using).

### Any downsides? 

Yes, Google/Cloudflare now know which websites you're going to. But let's face it, Google knew that anyway.

### Why does this work? 

Because websites (www.reddit.com) need to be translated to an IP address (151.101.193.140). so you first make a request to the DNS server asking for the IP address for the website you're interested in. 

Generally, the request is answered by your ISP. When the govt tells them to block a website, the easiest thing for them to do is to return a wrong response to the DNS request. So instead of asking your ISP, you're asking Google.

This will not work if the government decides to block on a more fundamental level, like say creating a firewall.",1574011734.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,6,5

4940,"A huge source of Air Pollution no one knows about - FMCG CompaniesMy uncle runs a distribution business, he is a wholesale dealer for ITC limited. He also owns a retail store (different business) which I visited to buy something and we sat to chit chat for a while and I randomly asked him out of curiosity, ""What do you do with expired products from your FMCG distribution business?"" to which he replied ""By chance aaj hi ana hai company official ne, aaja dikhau."" (""Coincidentally, a company official is coming today for the same reason, come let me show you"")

So I went to their warehouse from where they loaded all the expired fmcg products (food products like chips, biscuits, noodles, candy, frozen food, toiletries and cosmetics like creams, deodorants, soaps) in a truck, drove the truck to a back alley and unloaded all the goods, lit everything on fire and watched it. I was fucking shook. It was wrong on so many levels. First of all they were burning food, and burning the plastic wrapping with it. With air pollution already on the rise, burning plastic should be like an arrestable offense.

My uncle explained the reason behind this. He said that every FMCG company has to be very cautious about what is selling in the market, if anything less than the standard quality, let alone expired reaches the end consumer, there can be huge class action lawsuit. Health hazard is a big thing for law and any small complaint can cause a big company a lot of trouble like food license can be suspended or they have to compensate consumer in lakhs. And if these expired goods end up with someone irresponsible like roadside sellers they will probably sell them so it is very important for the company to destroy them completely. He said that he does not support it by any means but at the end of the day, business is business and he has to comply by company policy and allow the company officials to do it. He gets reimbursement for expired goods only after they are completely destroyed, so he can't come in the way of company officials because that will lead to his own loss in business.

When we were there watching the burning goods, a rag picker came and saw that. He said, ""Saab, hume khane ko nahi milta aur aap khane ki cheez ko aag laga rahe ho, hume dedo hum kha lenge."" (""Sir, we don't get enough to eat and you are burning food items, please give it to us we will eat it."") I tried to explain to him that they were expired so he couldn't eat them, but he was uneducated so he brought his son who was educated and understood the meaning of expired. His son said they have been eating expired food since birth. He said they buy these food items from roadside vendors who unpack these expired items and sell them loose to scam people. He said that they eat these expired biscuits when they don't have enough money for ""roti"". I felt pity for them and gave them a carton of biscuits from fresh stock and explained  to them why they shouldn't eat expired food.


All this while I tried to talk to the person who everyone was calling ""company official"", he was in charge of everything but he said he was busy. I finally got to have a word with him after the process was over and he came for coffee to my uncle's office where they exchanged documents and discussed about reimbursement which my uncle had to receive. I asked him directly why they were burning goods. He gave me the same reason as my uncle explained before. I asked him why ""burning"" and if there was any other way to get rid of the expired stock. He said there was no other way to completely destroy anything. I tried to explain to him that there is a recycling process by which plastic can be reused and there is no way FMCG companies in 1st world countries are allowed to burn products like that, there has to be some way those products could be treated or recycled or something, even if they have to be destroyed there has to be some way better than burning. His reply was, ""Bhai ye India hai, yahan pe itni technology nahi hai, air pollution to cars se bhi ho raha hai, diwali pe patkhe jalte hai, hum to fir bhi sahi kaam kar rahe hai koi kha lega expired product to health problem ho sakti hai."" (""Brother, this is India, high end technology does not exist here, air pollution is also caused by cars and diwali crackers, we are doing good work by making sure no one eats expired food because it can be harmful for health"") The same fucking problem with everyone in India, when you try to explain to them that they are causing air pollution, they will justify it by stating other sources of air pollution to you. How does that make any sense? He told me that every company does this which is true.

My uncle told me that because of the reimbursement, retailers and distributors are not in fear of dead stock and don't care if products are not sold. The company tries to launch rebate schemes for products which are nearing expiry date but retailers don't put in any efforts because they don't have to bear any loss. They burn expired goods worth over 1 lakh rupees every 3 months from my uncle's warehouse. Sometimes when the company launches a new product and if it fails, there is huge stock of unsold expired products and this number can reach up to 10 lakhs in 1 year. And this is one distributor in a small city. As this is FMCG business, products have to be made available in every smallest city, ITC limited has one of the most extensive distribution networks in the country with 1550 exclusive wholesale dealers. And to my knowledge every company in India is doing the exact same thing - ITC, Nestle, Britannia, Godrej, Amul, Patanjali and any other you can think of. The company policies could be different where some might be trying to reduce dead stock but the end is same, all of them burn huge heaps of unsold expired goods. Just imagine the total amount of air pollution caused collectively by all these companies with such large number of distributors and retailers.

I did some research and there does exist a law that tries to prevent this. An ITC wholesale dealer in a Tier-1 city recently burned 10 lakhs worth of goods in one go which attracted attention because of a huge fire. The matter reached the police and he was fined 1 lakh rupees. Since the company is already bearing a 10 lakh loss by reimbursing the wholesalers and retailers, a 10% increase in loss is nothing for them. And this is only a rare case when someone was fined for this. According to what I have been told, this law is nowhere near being implemented. The worst thing is, the government knows that these companies can get in trouble if they don't destroy the expired goods completely and they have imposed a fine on burning of goods. There is no guidance on what the correct method should be to treat these goods which leaves these companies with no choice so they have just added 10% to their losses and moved on.

TL;DR: FMCG companies in India burn crores worth of expired goods every month which is a huge source of air pollution that no one knows about.",1574000308.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,38,216

Perhaps you know what the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is. If you don’t, let me explain.
 
(No, don’t be alarmed. It has nothing to do with that other Five Point thing. Calm down. Breathe)
 
There’s this thing in martial arts called the Touch of Death. In essence, it’s a technique that’s supposedly used to kill someone using quick, otherwise non-lethal force targeted at specific areas of the body. Shrouded in secrecy and replete with legend, the Touch of Death attacks pressure points in the body “to incapacitate or cause immediate or even delayed death to an opponent”.
 
Nobody even knows if it’s effective but let’s assume it is. Like air purifiers in Delhi.  
 
The Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique is a type of Touch of Death made famous in the movie ‘Kill Bill’. In it, a person is hit on five different pressure points on the body. After the person moves and takes five steps, their heart explodes and they die. Gruesome.
 
I don’t think anybody is going to die, but last week, the Indian economy was hit on five different, crucial pressure points.

**On Monday, the tax collection numbers trickled in**
 
The Income Tax department has a problem. It’s not getting enough taxes.
 
And it’s across multiple tax categories.
 
Corporate tax grew by just 0.5% between April to October as compared to the previous year. The plan, according to the budget, was for Corporate Taxes to go up by 15.4% as compared to the previous year. Of course, a big chunk of the shortfall is attributable to the corporate tax cuts that occurred a couple of months back.
 
Personal income collection grew by 5% over the same period, against the year’s target of 22.4%.
 
Direct tax collection touched Rs 5,20,000 crore (~ $78 Bn), which is just 39% of the year’s target. To meet the goal, the income tax department will need to expand its collection rate by 30%.
 
This leaves the I-T department with two options. Either get more aggressive with tax collections. Or ask for targets to be cut.
 
Right now, the I-T department is getting...mixed messages.

As Reuters reported,
 
“Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants them to collect 17% more in direct taxes this year as New Delhi seeks to shore up revenues amid a sharp economic slowdown. The target has been maintained even though Modi recently approved a massive cut in corporate taxes, which are part of direct taxes, and warned officers not to harass businesses in their drive to collect revenue.
 
Over a dozen tax officials interviewed by Reuters said they are stuck between a push to meet unrealistic collection targets, which influence their appraisals and transfers, and the fear of being accused of over-zealousness if they crack down on evasion.”
 
So what’s the I-T department doing, now that it’s stuck between a rock and a hard place?
 
On one hand, it’s getting creative with its definitions of what’s taxable. This week, they conducted preliminary enquiries to find out if they could levy a 18% GST (Goods and Services Tax) on CXO salaries.
 
I am not even going to try to explain the I-T department’s reasoning, but suffice to say, taxing income as a service is...a stretch, you’d think.
 
And lawyers agree. As the Economic Times reported,
 
“The interpretation adopted by the tax authorities is that an employee of an organisation should be considered as an employee of a particular office only (not the organisation as a whole) for GST-related purposes. Such an interpretation is legally and factually incorrect,” said Rohit Jain, partner with law firm ELP.
 
On the other hand, the I-T department is desperately trying to bring down their targets. And not by a small amount.
 
As the Business Standard reported,
 
“We are expecting a cut of at least Rs 1 trillion in the Budget target for direct tax collection to bring it closer to the ground realities. Economic slowdown has severely affected our mop-up, and corporation tax cuts have made the target further unrealistic,” said a government official.
 
So, a little bit of both.

**On Tuesday, the industrial output numbers were released**
 
How does one measure the health of industries?
 
The way India does it is through something called the Index of Industrial Production (IIP). Just like a stock market index, the IIP is represented by categories like manufacturing, consumer durables, capital goods, and so on.
 
In good times, the index trends upwards. Occasionally, one or more categories may be down, either due to seasonality or due to cyclical demand, but overall, it’s usually growing.
 
In July this year, for instance, the index was up by 4.6%.
 
In August, it was down by 1.4%. This was an 81-month low. The thinking at the time was that this was probably an anomaly, and things would be back on track the next month once the September numbers were released, especially because of the festival season in October.
 
It was released on Tuesday.
 
In September, the index was down by 4.3%.
 
All thanks to one sector—manufacturing, which accounts for 78% of the index.
 
Why is this worrying? Because it’s clear that nobody believes this is an anomaly. Least of all, manufacturers, who didn’t even bother to boost production output before the festive season in October.
 
“September, the month before the festive season kicked in, saw production of consumer durables contract for the fourth-straight month. Production contracted by 10 per cent, up from 9 per cent in the previous month. The negative growth baffled economists who said e-commerce sales in October was very high and should have been on the back of positive growth in this segment.
 
Crucially, the consumer non-durables category slipped into contraction for the first time in FY20, with production thinning by 0.4 per cent. ""The sequential worsening in the performance of consumer durables and non-durables in September belies any hopes of a pre-festive restocking of inventories,"" Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA, said.
 
To explain what happened on Wednesday, here’s Rohin.

**On Wednesday, an entire sector raised a flag of surrender**
 
Hope is a wonderful thing. It keeps you going in the face of adversity. It is so powerful that it can reshape the reality around you, so you see hope where others only see despair.[ Like Vodafone-Idea in India all these years, even in the face of quarterly results that looked like this.](https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/wRUWxgIhI3RAddBCCk4YzwZKw8Nk3RUSfg3dwL6DTzHkewpBfw51BrTRoQBBD_e6_p8prrSTEEpVLmnV1N56vFl4rY5Adu39Wt0ydJNTqu84l8sScPCmjRAGKfDzedF0xWUzW8w7gJP0O8H1cWkaHBYP8aGrMGPhjKnUBLexkDdjG0i1yCZXvtw1HCYlCcmiilNho7jSLCG1B-9L9aS0_OYc_92k_iiaipAkJP-I6JQYejc1QssaX-RVT1pO6Z9GwhZn3pgUrY_4UBmx9jXyKRmjRzA=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c57f772ed4710fe5ad2873497cbe3b2aa68f1b8bfd08d75a992950304074479bc1759b013be1b8e1a9c11e058517342f0c35c1a1db222f2a1e4c7d0b07523c16.png)

But everyone reaches a breaking point. Reservoirs of hope aren’t endless either. On Wednesday, Vodafone must have realised that after posting the largest quarterly loss in India’s history. A loss so gargantuan that the axis numbers in the above graph, with added data from the latest quarter, [were no longer recognizable.](https://ci3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/XF7y_RPS_ljUaqF8FSIv_8hQ2D7GtA1TDqphEpOiZr0kRz-EohSG52OD55PJNCsPu5hNQG7-sCN1ArF2b4cuS9p4f5zTvE42Pz7InNkU3UJYGGBZSWWMAwxWnEuFqLZIcua4LXTqYtKw6IKmfPQ9fVYDaap_YZgWx-x0rmzliS0uuubBD_fRGJed7B_9ICA4vQ6f-JOt4K6QL29lMRumBVc1BoFRX3An6fvQzkYwc-zJIz1pV0fH2cL1gVLtabY0cAcxHUi94T98fqsg2eGWe5WRm5M=s0-d-e1-ft#https://marketing-image-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/c8c2d733c0c4ec3c5ea7bbfff69fc527a8d29779e7a2c48de26a6685493ad54c29c19dc6cd8d31770d565802dea5b2259753791c30d9acd376a8c4c429c37c45.png)

And that was how Vodafone, which owns 44.3% of Vodafone-Idea (27.6% is owned by Indian business conglomerate Aditya Birla Group), lost hope.
 
Vodafone-Idea’s loss was triggered by the imposition of a massive $4 billion retrospective fine demanded by the Indian government and ratified by its Supreme Court last month. (We wrote about it in depth in an earlier issue of The Nutgraf). A fine that came atop existing debt of $14 billion.

At a press meeting in London, Vodafone CEO Nick Read threw up his hands.
 
“Financially there’s been a heavy burden through unsupportive regulation, excessive taxes and on top of that we got the negative supreme court decision.
 
If you don’t get the remedies being suggested, the situation is critical. If you’re not a going concern, you’re moving into a liquidation scenario -- can’t get any clearer than that.”
 
A “going concern” is an accounting concept that assumes a private company has the financial resources to continue operations for at least the near future, usually at least 12 months. A company that does not believe it is a going concern is usually headed for operational disruptions, fire sales of assets and finally, a bankruptcy.
 
Thus, CEOs do not kid around with the phrase. Certainly not CEOs of global corporations like Vodafone.
 
In India, the mood in Vodafone-Idea’s finance department must have been funereal when they added the following lines to the latest quarterly results.
 
“It is to be noted that our ability to continue as going concern is dependent on obtaining the reliefs from the Government as discussed above and positive outcome of the proposed legal remedy. Pending the outcome of the above matters, these financial results have been prepared on a Going Concern Basis.”
 
This is company speak for: we’re drowning, and if the government doesn’t throw us a life preserver, we’ll be sleeping with the fishes.
But it wasn’t just Vodafone-Idea that was revisiting the concept of “going concern.” Bharti Airtel, India’s second largest private telecom operator, told stock exchanges it, too, had doubts about its future.
 
“This represents a material uncertainty whereby, it may be unable to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business, and accordingly may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern.”

With 2 out of the 3 private telecom operators in the doldrums, India risked turning back two decades of progress in telecom, argued Sunil Jain in the Financial Express.
 
“The other reason why Modi needs to listen to Read is that, once Vodafone Idea shuts down, India will be back to where it was in 1999 before the Vajpayee government ushered in India’s telecom revolution.
 
Prior to 1999, there were just two mobile services providers; while Vajpayee ensured unlimited competition was brought in, India could once again have just two players, RJio and Bharti Airtel (apart from BSNL-MTNL, provided the merger and VRS results in a viable firm). In which case, the government/Trai will be back to monitoring the industry closely to guard against cartelization, rigging prices and stifling innovation; each tariff plan will have to, once again, be cleared by Trai. Most governments and regulators attempt to increase competition to ensure the industry grows well, the Modi government will preside over the death of two decades of competition.”
 
How did the Department of Telecom, the government department charged with “formulating developmental policies for the accelerated growth of the telecommunication services” react to this distress?
 
First it said, Oh, we’re still working out the numbers, but Vodafone-Idea and Bharti Airtel better steel themselves for another 10% increase in their retrospective fines.
 
Then it requested the Supreme Court to prevent a merger between Bharti Airtel and Tata Teleservices (now defunct), because it wanted another Rs 8,000 crore (~$1.2 billion) from Bharti Airtel. The merger it was objecting to took place in October 2017.
 
Things ended on a good note though finally, with Vodafone CEO writing to the Indian government to proclaim that he is confident of the India growth story and that the country remains a key market for his company.
 
Vodafone meanwhile wrote down the value of its 44.3% shareholding in Vodafone-Idea to zero.
 
Then came Thursday.

**On Thursday, the inflation numbers came in**
 
If there was one thing that was working in the Indian economy’s favour, it was this—inflation was on the lower side. In fact, it had been declining slowly and steadily for years.
 
That ended on Thursday.
 
As the Economic Times reported,
 
India's Retail inflation for the month of October breached the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) medium-term target of 4% for the first time since July 2018 due to higher food prices even though RBI had predicted that food prices ""are likely to moderate as winter supplies enter the market"".
Inflation is said to be a tax on the poor. Which in itself is bad enough. But there’s a bigger problem.
 
The good thing about keeping inflation in check is that it gives the RBI a very useful weapon to combat a slowdown—rate-cuts.
 
With inflation going up, that weapon gets blunter. And difficult to use. As the article quoted above goes on to say,
 
The Uptick in headline inflation and its subsequent breach of the Central bank's medium-term target might push RBI to put the breaks on its rate cut cycle in the next MPC meet that is scheduled for December 5.
 
To summarise the week so far:
 
Prices are going up

Industrial output is falling

Tax collections are down

The telecom sector is on the verge of collapse
 
Then came Friday.
 
When things went from bad to...bizarre.

 **On Friday, the consumer expenditure survey results came out...and went away**
 
So there’s this organisation in India called the National Statistical Office (NSO). This is a government organisation that’s a part of the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation.
 
The most important thing the NSO does is to go out and collect data. Periodically. Data about income. About consumption. About many other things. All of this data is used by the government of India to draft policy, design welfare schemes, target benefits, etc.
 
Cool? Cool.
 
So there’s one important activity that the NSO does called the Consumer Expenditure Survey. Every five years, it checks what people are consuming and where they are spending their money on. The last time this survey was done was in 2011-12. So the next survey results were expected to be released anytime.
 
It dropped on Friday.
 
Not from the government.
 
But was leaked by a journalist at Business Standard, Somesh Jha.
 
What did it say?
 
Read it for yourself.
 
Consumer spending fell for the first time in more than four decades in 2017-18, primarily driven by slackening rural demand, according to the latest consumption expenditure survey by the National Statistical Office (NSO).
 
Experts said a dip in consumption expenditure indicated an increasing prevalence of poverty in the country. The data set also corroborates a shortage of demand in the economy, driven by the rural market.
 
The lowest in four decades.
 
What happened next?
 
A statement.
 
“In view of data quality issues, the Ministry (of Statistics and Programme Implementation) has decided not to release the consumer expenditure survey results of 2017-2018. The ministry is separately examining the feasibility of conducting the next consumer expenditure survey in 2020-2021 and 2021-22 after incorporating all data quality refinements in the survey process”
 
This means that India will not have an estimate on poverty levels for nearly a decade.
 
Is there anything to be optimistic about?
 
Well, I am not an economist, but perhaps the last week was where India hit the bottom. Maybe the worst is behind us. Maybe the actions taken earlier will start to kick in.
 
It’s just one of those weeks where everything that could go wrong, did.
 
Next up is Sreedhar, about a city called Amaravati.

***Investments are subject to politics***

Here’s an interesting story.
 
Amaravati, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, was to be an exemplar for city development. The state government acquired a large swathe of land to build a city from scratch. The state’s past track record, it has topped the Ease of Doing Business index for Indian states for years now, meant investors were brought on board, funding secured and a roadmap etched.
 
But then the Andhra Pradesh government changed. And with it so did Amaravati’s fortunes. The city was deeply associated with the flamboyance of its former chief minister Chandrababu Naidu. So, his successor, Jagan Mohan Reddy, chose to quickly and steadily kill projects associated with Naidu.
 
This week, he cancelled a contract with a Singapore consortium which was to build an exclusive startup area in the new city. He also trashed contracts with companies for a new airport, two seaports and a mall in the state.
 
Earlier, the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank withdrew separate loans totalling $500 million dollars.
 
A political powerplay affecting investments into what was to be a grand project could have a ripple effect across the state and country. The fickleness of India’s state governments means that investors will have one eye on a party’s political platform before pulling out the cheque book again.
 
And over to Jon, for our evergreen segment...

***Last Week in Softbank***

What do OYO, Paytm, WeWork, Didi Chuxing and Grab have in common?
 
None are profitable—that’s right—but there’s more. These are SoftBank Vision Fund unicorns that have all made unlikely forays into the Japanese market.
 
It’s no accident. SoftBank has a penchant for bringing portfolio companies to Japan, its home country and a place that its chairman Masayoshi Son has lambasted for an “underdeveloped” tech ecosystem.
 
“As I love Japan, I want to invest in Japanese companies but the reality is that there are no unicorn AI companies in the country,” he said at a conference in July. Unsurprisingly, a glut of Son’s Great Hopes have arrived—each entering through joint ventures with SoftBank, a move that gives the investor a greater say in operations.
 
OYO opened an initial 100 hotels in October; Japan is Paytm’s first move overseas—it claims 10 million users over 10 months; China’s Didi teamed up with SoftBank to take on Uber, a rival counts both among its investor bench. There’s evidence the JV strategy contains a dose of magic. WeWork—the struggling co-working giant that saw its valuation fall from $40B to $10B following a canceled IPO—is said to be close to profitability in Japan. Yes, you read that right.
 
Now it’s the turn of Grab. But rather than a JV, the Southeast Asian ride-hailer has arrived in Japan courtesy of Splyt, an innovative startup that connects ride-hailing services to enable users to ‘roam’ between countries. We’ve written about Grab's struggle to become profitable, and it’ll no doubt hope that the sprinkling of Japanese pixie dust is both genuine and contagious.
That’s it from me.

Joined an 'integrated coaching institute' for JEE. Always wanted to do space research (planetary science). I have lost hope and confidence in myself. I still do great (4th rank in OMR exams in my centre (100 kids), Class topper in Biology and English NCERT but just average in other subjects). 
I've lost hope as I cannot get to remember formulae and equations in PCM (for NCERT) and it disheartens me. But still am trying my best. 
What should I study and where should I study to have a set career in that direction.
I'm from Vellore, Tamil Nadu and am ok studying anywhere in the country as long as it doesn't cost a lot of money. It would be great if the UNI takes us in through entrance exams or consider JEE marks instead of just NCERT marks. Thanks for your reply in advance.

P.S. Also, I'm NOT into Astrophysics. I think the most probable option for that field is to study aerospace engineering but am not too keen about it. Any opportunities through studying Geography?(Maybe?)

As my friend and I only have two weeks in Rajasthan our priority is to save as much as possible in this transit.

I have made a pros/cons list and based on this flying seems the better option.

However I have based this list on my own internet research/assumptions so I am hoping reddit can help me sense check to see if I am on the right track. 

Site used: https://www.rome2rio.com/map/Udaipur/Jaisalmer

Thank you!!

1. Fly from Udaipur to Ahmedabad then to Jaisalmer from there (5 hours total via Spice Jet).

Pros
-affordable  - 5,329 rupee per flight approx
-Quickest possible route
-Hopefully will minimise delays in transit

Cons
-Won't see any sites on the way
-Not enough time to make use of stop over in Ahmedabad.
-Spice Jet may have delays or hidden costs?


2. Drive from Udaipur  to Jaisalmer via private car

Pros
-Could be cheap - approx 7815 rupees for a taxi as per Rome to Rio.
-Potentially the more “scenic route” with sites and the “real Rajasthan” as we drive past? 

Cons
-Hard to gauge costs here - based on Rome to Rio will be approx 7815 rupees.
-Length anywhere between 8 to 12 hours based on different online sources?
-Would any driver even agree to this long a route?  If not, changing drivers could lead to further delays
-Ideally we would have more time and stop as we go to make the most of this route, however we don’t have enough time to do this.",1573949455.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,5

If I am unhappy with one branch can I transfer to the other? Indian police is very vague.

5059,"Ragging, Hooliganism and Physical and mental abuse by seniors and authorities inside a private tier-4 Engineering college in West Bengal.First off I will let you know that I can't reveal any details or identifying information about anyone or even myself, since I am already at life risk.  


Now, here is the story. We have our second internal exams going on and I am a first year student at a private engineering college here, in West Bengal. On Friday, 15th November, 7-8 4th year college students beat me up inside the college campus due to a whatsapp text that I sent in a private group of our first year students. I am very apologetic and whatever my fault might be, is it right to beat up a student? This is ragging. They beat me black and blue in front of all the first years, 2nd years and 3rd years. The problem is we have second internal exams going on and our exams get over at 1:15pm. The seniors said that we should stay in the campus until 4pm without giving any valid reason. We had exams again next day and have to prepare for that. My health was quite unwell and I went back to my home on thursday. While on my way back home, they asked me to come back to the college. I didn't do that because it was not possible. On Friday, after the exams I was at the train station, A professor called me up and asked me to come back to college and that he would pay for my fare. Hardly had I entered the gates of the college, a 4th year guy came and enquired if I was that first year student (Name XYZ). When I said yes, he gave me 5-6 tied slaps to my face. I remained silent and had no clue as to what happened. Inside the campus, I saw 1st year,2nd year,3rd year and 4th year waiting for me. I went towards them. Then they showed me some whatsapp message that I sent in a private whatsapp group and asked for it's meaning. I tried to explain and I can clearly see the misunderstanding yet I wanted to say sorry for my behaviour. As soon as I started opening my mouth, they beat me black and blue. They wouldn't listen to me. Now the authorities came up and said that they will go to the police station with me but they would cancel my university registration. And all this over a whatsapp message that also on a private group in which the seniors are not a part of. Can you just imagine? Yesterday my parents and guardians went to meet with the college authority. They lied straight to my parents about my behaviour being rude. I have never behaved rudely with anyone inside the college. But they are now just cooking up stories just because and not a single person, despite being my friend can say anything because they are in fear that even similar things will happen to them. When my mother asked why I was beaten. The authorities said, ""Nobody beats up someone while walking in the streets just for no reason."" This is their response! This is unimaginable. The beat me so bad, I have bumps on my head. I couldnt fall asleep for the past 24 hours because of the pain. I was feeling suicidal. I am still apologizing and still begging. Even if I say sorry, they say my attitude is not perfect. I would have left this college, but I just noticed yesterday that the forms for wbjee has been closed, and If I leave this college I won't be able to join another one until 2021. I don't want to waste another 2 years for no reason. I don't have the financial strength or support to fight against these people. They have already made up false cases and sent to the university I guess. Never in my entire life, did I imagine something so bad can happen to me. If I go via law route, I won't stand a chance and they know it and they are taking advantage of that. They are abusing me and torturing me mentally and physically. They are not listening to even my parents and they are not even showing me any proof. If anyone has political affiliations or know people in power. Please help me out. I can't take this anymore. They wronged me and yet I am the one begging for an apology and I am the one who is suffering. I am still trying to let go off this incident and forget about it and move one. But they are hell bent at abusing and torturing me and ruining me.
Are these even human beings? Where is humanity?  

What can I do here? Because going to UGC or AICTE or anti ragging committee is not an option, since they will already force everyone of the students to give false witness against me. So it's me against some 300-400 students whom I don't even know personally. It's their words against ours. If anyone knows any local MLA/ MP in charge.

5094,"YSK- Streaming website Mubi has launched an 'India' Section consisting of classic Indian arthouse and independent moviesIf anyone here hasn't heard of [Mubi](http://www.mubi.com), they're a fantastic streaming service with a unique feature of having only 30 films available at a time, giving the user an option of 30 days to watch any film. Their selection is mostly from the world of art-house and independent cinema and recently they've launched a section/channel for Indian film which you can access as part of a regular subscription.

And what's better? Mubi is **entirely free** [if you're a student](https://mubi.com/filmstudent). All you need is to enter a .edu email address, or an .ac.in email address and you're good to go.
The pricing for unfortunate souls who don't have/can't nick an edu address is Rs. 199 for the first 3 months and then Rs. 500 monthly.

A few of the films that are available to view right now:

* Mani Kaul's *Duvidha*
* Kamal Swaroop's *Om Dar-b-Dar*
* Mrinal Sen's *Antareen*
* Shyam Benegal's *Mammo*
* Gurvinder Singh's *Anhey Ghorey Da Daan*
* Saeed Akhtar Mirza's *Naseem*

Mubi also does curations based on certain themes/directors which I always find interesting. For the India channel, they have a collection called *Mumbai: Cinema and the City*, with the likes of *Naseem*, *Salaam Bombay*, *Gaman* and *Salim Langde Pe Mat Ro* included. Another curation is the restored films of Guru Dutt (highly highly recommend if you've only seen *Pyaasa* or *Kaagaz ke Phool* on a shitty DVDrip)

Given the sad state of our film industry these days and the unavailability of most of these classic films on DVD/Blu-ray/rentals, this is a great opportunity for people who're interested in viewing movies from India's parallel cinema movement .

If you're interested in a similar service, [NFDC's Cinemas of India](https://www.cinemasofindia.com/) website also serves a similar purpose, with a very cheap 599/year plan with a more than decent collection. But their video player was really buggy the last time I checked so *shrug*. Worth looking into because they offer rentals which cost around 60 bucks, and they have more than 30 films at a time, if that's not your thing.",1573978375.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,14,57

A common scenario - Everytime, there'll be 2 employees at a single booth. One who operates the machine and the other one who handles the cash. Each time, one would start off by asking me how much.
Take for example what happened today, i said 500. Apparently he hears 400 and in the meanwhile the other guy on the opposite side of the bike asked me cash or card. Just to draw my attention away. I still tell the guy 500.
The guy entered something on the keypad, showing me he entered 500 But i knew something's always up and had a look at the metre - it was 100. The previous person had filled up 100 in his scooty. I said cash and the guy starts asking me about my bike's average. I take a peek at the meter and the guy starts filling petrol starting from 100. Meanwhile the other guy kept on chattering, i politely declined every question he asked. Finally when the metre hit 500 the guy pulled his nozzle out and asked for the money. I parked the bike, got off the bike and asked him how much he filled. He replied 500. And i could see he was nervous.
This was the 5th occasion i had been through this kind of a scenario. I called the manager and a small group of people formed up in the commotion.
Long story short - the manager kept his silence and offered to wave the entire charge of petrol free but never accepted that his junior employee made a delibrate attempt at fraud. He maintained it was an isolated incident and an innocent mistake.

I am faced with this for the 5th time. Beware of such tricks. Keep an eye on meter at all times.

I'm 22 years old and haven't graduated yet. It's a cause of great perturbation for me. I'm often told it's futile to compare my progression with that of others. But i just can't help it. I see my friends thriving, enjoying that corporate campus. I understand that being a lowly employee is no enviable position.

But it undoubtedly is better than being dependent on your parents despite being this old. It's shameful. My friends, let me rephrase, those I thought were friends have partners. I'm happy for them. But having never been loved romantically i experience yearning for it. At this stage getting a lucrative job seems far fetched. Also seeing my parents'generation and also my contemporaries live this prosaic life inspires no hope.

I'm no trust fund baby. As much as I'm averse to this mundane life I'll have to live it.
I'm experiencing this unique cocktail of emotions- fear, sadness, hopelessness, exhaustion with a sprinkle of self doubt and dollops of dissatisfaction.
I've had some bitter experiences and I've become a cynic. I got forced into reclusion by my circumstances. I'd like to change my life. But i dont even know what changes I'd like to make.

I got excited and ordered 6 toys in 1 order. That was in June 2019.

The order was held by Indian Customs and DHL informed me that I won't be receiving that order since it contains sex toys. I informed Lovehoney about this and they refunded my payment.

Now today is November 16th and I received 2 toys from that order shipped from inside India only.

So, basically I received the 2 toys that I wanted the most for free.

I'm still making sense of it. Maybe God and good people do exist. Although I'm now afraid that I might receive the rest of them anytime.

Regular fit jeans were practically unavailable - across multiple brands like Levi's, Pepe Jeans, Indian Terrain, John Players and many more. 

All denim jeans have little or no ""denim"" in them - they're all cheap, Lycra infused, stretchable pieces of thin textured rags. Ffs i have socks which are thicker!!!

Slim fit, Skinny fit, Tapered fit, Super Slim fit, Contemporary fit and many such adjectives for basically the same darn nonsense.

Admittedly, I have large thighs & i'm a tad overweight, so I've struggled with bottom wear regularly - but what's stopping all these brands to make basic ass jeans for the rest of the world or at least our country folks?!?

Regular fit, mid waist jeans in proper, thick denim - this is basically the most primitive version of jeans - but trying to find such a combination in shops - and even online - seems like a hunt for a unicorn to me right now. 

Am i the only facing such a struggle at the moment?

5387,"Can someone explain to me the Big Brain Maths behind the Gurgaon property market?So Mint yesterday had a report from Proptiger about the Gurgaon-Noida property market

In Gurgaon, there were about 2,700 properties sold between July-September

At the same time, supply of housing increased by ~2,300. 

BUT the total unsold inventory in Noida-Gurgaon stood at ~ 1.06 lakh.

So effectively, this market keeps adding new supply even when there is a massive pile of unsold inventory. New units sold is almost the same as new supply added.

This is like buying 100kg of aata and keeping it in your house. But when you actually want to make rotis, you go to the market again to buy 100gm of aata instead of using what you have.

The kicker: despite this oversupply, consolidated prices fell by just 4%

What miracle do builders think will happen to magically sell the outstanding 1.06L of inventory? Even as they keep adding to the supply?

This Big Brain Maths is beyond my feeble brain

5432,"Pro-hindutva book Aavarana: The VeilI am recommended this book multiple times when I tell people that I like reading books about history and politics of India.

[https://www.amazon.in/Aavarana-Veil-S-L-Bhyrappa-ebook/dp/B015P6AZX0](https://www.amazon.in/Aavarana-Veil-S-L-Bhyrappa-ebook/dp/B015P6AZX0)

This book is a very much pro-hindutva just like its author – S. L. Bhyrappa. This is a book written in a way that does not come across as non-fiction. It claims it is a story backed by facts. So no one can take exception to this.

It clearly is an anti-Muslim propaganda written only one narrative in mind. Mughals, Aurangzeb and how the Muslims converted Hindus to Islam, how liberals hide ‘facts’, how Hinduism is constantly persecuted lot, and so on.

I mean, if I sit down to write how Hindu rulers were bad, I’d find so much material to back my stance. People don’t seem to understand this. When your premise is fixed, when you are hell-bent on believing something, you are bound to find so much material to support it.

The book clearly isn’t a piece of history even if it likes to pretend like it is. It very much appears like a student was given a topic “How Muslims were bad” to write an essay on, and the student came up with this shitty book.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: Added author’s name and other details.

Edit 2: Some guests from r/indiaspeaks have been lurking here and going crazy about how the *liberals* clap when Brahminism is criticized.

Brahmins oppressed their own (Hindu) people to claim their supremacy in society. Mostly Hindus or Brahmins write or talk more about how Brahminism is and was bad. You'll never hear or read about a non-Hindu going crazy about Brahminism all the time.

It's possible that you'll not find many cases of mosque desecration - simply because the advancing armies were largely those of the Delhi Sultanate and later Mughal rulers, which happened to be Muslims. They were more advanced in warfare and this is why they were able to capture so much land.  The kingdoms of Hindu rulers were doing the defending and not advancing.

In any case, the rulers of that period were not desperate to target specific religious institutions. Winning wars was what mattered, but these were not holy battles. Humiliating the enemy could be part of this, but the Mughal rulers had to balance that with maintaining peace and order within their own kingdoms - you don't get long-lasting kingdoms by annoying your people, most of whom would have been Hindu.

If temples were destroyed by Muslim rulers, it was not in the name of religion, but as a result of war and only the temples in the enemy's states\*,\* not the ones within their own kingdom. Hindu rulers have been doing this, too.

>In 1742, the Maratha ruler Malhar Rao Holkar made a plan to demolish the mosque and reconstruct the Vishweshwar temple at the site. However, his plan did not materialize, partially because of intervention by the Nawabs of Lucknow, who controlled the territory.[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMadhuri_Desai201781-18) Later, in 1780, his daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar constructed the present Kashi Vishwanath Temple adjacent to the mosque.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyanvapi_Mosque#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMadhuri_Desai201783-11) (Source: Wikipedia)

2- We Indian start worshipping farming as the main tool to remove poverty, not as a tool to fill the stomach of Indian. which start system to give everything free to the farmer and stop the market hand in farm product. 

In 1960, when India has widespread drought, a new system to store food come into India by which government start to buy cereal from the farmer and distributing it.

  problem with it is that Farmer starts selling the crop to the government but how much government can buy and distribute it (there are 1960 35kr people in India, you can't reach to everyone with that level of technology). so left out farmers sell their crop in one time, which decrease the price of the crop . Also due to this system, there is no need for food storage by the farmer so no one makes new storage it other than the government.

3-In India there is the problem of the people mentality -

it's so where when people started to make fun of Pakdoanomics nad Teanomics, it is job from where main uplifting of poor come into the market. how many people and story you know where father sell tea and pakdoa and parethe and chat, son become food store chain owner. 

 in my village neighbourhood, one man comes from Mumbai and start a Badapav stall at Chopal about 2 years ago today he give work to his 3 brothers and move out to city to open stall, at the chopal 5 new food stall open, seeing his success.

 today important to more people come into the food-stall industry with there liquid (money) to give people Job because in production and farming job are decreasing . and government cant stomach both much-needed infrastructure whose cost are many-fold increases due to the price of land and a government job for people.

4-Culture  of office - in India job is only related with, to dream with an office with too much file. so why will normal people want to do the manual job? so manual job become poorest people work with that there work price decrease, with low budget come you death which all time happen in India.",1573887792.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,0,0

5516,"Fellow LGBTQIA+ people of India who had to undergo conversion therapy, what was your experience?TRIGGER WARNING: detailed account of traumatic events

Hi
I am a trans lesbian who happen to be , (maybe because I rolled for initiative and ended up with a 1) unfortunately, Indian and living in india. Cutting to the topic at hand.

When I was a child, when I told the psychiatrist that I don't think I'm a boy, he started to do very intensive talk therapy, to convince me that I'm a cisgender male. I didn't want to but I was forced to go by my parents who took the side of the psychiatrist. Thankfully, out of an act of desperation, I acted like I no longer felt dissociated with my body and managed to convince my psychiatrist that his treatment worked. However, it was a very traumatic experience and I still have PTSD I developed from that even now.

I am curious what my fellow Indians have faced on similar levels. It is pretty much common knowledge that there are doctors in India who claim to be able to 'cure' homosexuality. I wanted to know what your experience with conversion therapy. 

So little is documented about survivor accounts of conversion therapy in India. So sad that organizations like the national sample survey organization who is more than capable of doing this has neglected the LGBTQIA+ population by collecting no data.

Also, conversion therapy is a HORRIBLE thing for anyone to go through and it is hard to talk about it, especially if you have experienced it yourself. It is understandable if you are not in a position to share or don't want to. 

Much love",1573874707.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,50,48

My dad retired 2 years back from a government organization where he did not have a pension scheme. He has saved 25L or so over the years to sustain for himself. 

He has had thoughts for opening a playschool because he wanted to do something in education. Noble idea? Yes. But he does not have any background in education/teaching etc. and understanding how schools are run. More importantly, the problem is that my dad...unfortunately, lacks business acumen and is very trusting of people. 

He tried to have a franchise with one company, signed a contract, and lost 1L there that the company refused to return. This was done without much consultation with me (where I could have at least tried to look into this and prevent it) Next, he aligned with another school and took their franchise and has spent 8L till date, running at a significant loss. 

I also have 2 elder brothers but they are not very supportive in terms of finance or else. We all are living in different cities (they in Mumbai, I am in Delhi, parents are in UP) My sister-in-law did step in as school coordinator initially but found a teaching gig (right step imo) elsewhere soonafter. Year to date, there are only 5 children with 2 teachers who mostly sit whole day. My dad acts as school coordinator. 


**Current situation:**

Lately, he argues that he will open school in own home by using the part of the building that is being rented out. (School is being run in a rented out building) He also expects me to support him financially despite my multitude of warnings, ignoring number of suggestions I made etc. To put cherry on the cake, I came across a profile of an experienced School coordinator which I suggested to my dad so that she can lead this but he rejected it because she was Muslim. (which wasn't something I expected of my dad...but that's another story)

My concern stems from the fact that this is a deep hole my dad is sinking himself into in terms of expenses. This is worrying for me because I have started job just 2 years back and expect it'd be at least 3-4 years before I am in a position where I can help him out a bit. Additionally, the current tenant has has are pretty good + it offers a recurring cashflow in terms of his savings.

My take on this is that if he wants to focus on education, why not simply open a scholarship scheme or suppport some decent schools for underpriviliged kids? While there is no upside to this financially, the amount can be fixed and it is far better use of the money IMO.

So I recently completed my engineering from a tier 3 college. I couldnt secure any job because of lack of adequate percentage(60%). Right now I dont have any job and I am panicking. I have learnt web development recently so currently I know till frontend. Being a freshers ruins all hope in getting any job. I was very lazy but got hold of myself recently and did minimum coding 1 hr everyday for last 1 month and learnt till frontend in web development. There is a job opening here but thats for android development. I dont know anything about it. They are willing to train freshers but I heard that android development will die soon. I already put time learning web development so should I still apply for the android development job ? In future I want to switch to web development again, will that be even possible ? will I have to apply as a fresher again since having no job experience for web development ? being at home I have become very panicky. I dont really know what to do. Did I fuck up too much ?

Right now there is no opening for web developers around my place. They need experience. What should I do ? I dont want to move to Pune or Banglore because being fresher I will have very less pay and I will have to live in a pg. I am willing to move out in a year.  Did any of you experienced anything like this ? I was in a terrible place. I was very lazy, had loads of backlogs but didnt give up. cleared all papers from last 3 semesters with 0 backs and passed out. I was very happy with my growth. but now again back to square 1.",1573826700.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,14

### Tl;Dr

The recent expose on snooping conducted on the Whatsapp platform through the use of Pegasus in India has garnered a lot of attention from the public, press and thankfully even Parliamentary Standing Committees. Press reports indicate interest has been showed by the Standing Committee on Home Affairs in examining the matter. We wrote to them with a few suggestions on the issue to take into consideration at their meeting today. 

### Some background

Our representation made sure to provide the Committee with brief background information on the incident. We covered our bases by explaining the role of CitizenLab, the NSO Group and the discovery of the attacks in India. We previously put out a statement on the issue in case you need a bit of catching up to do ([**Read here for more)**](https://internetfreedom.in/statement-scary-disclosures-on-use-of-nso-spyware-in-india-signal-a-need-for-urgent-remedy/). 

### Our worries

We provide sufficient emphasis on the lack of legality to this entire fiasco. Here are a few snippets of our explanation: 

* *No legality:* There is no provision under Indian law under any circumstance that provides legal basis for the installation of such spyware; the powers under the pre-existing surveillance provisions of the Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Information Technology Act, 2000 do not permit the installation of spyware or hacking of mobile devices or computer resources, which is in fact criminalised under the Information Technology Act, 2000.
* *Unimaginable hit to privacy:* The constitutional standard established in K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India ((2017) 10 SCC 1) applicable to the violation of the right to privacy, finds this instance of snooping to go way beyond the requirements of proportionality and necessity, conditions heavily mandated.
* *No remedy: A*s secrecy is an inherent trait of surveillance, the individual under surveillance has no manner of proving it thereby being unable to establish a breach which curtails remedy to an individual under Article 32 and 226 of the Constitution.

In light of these concerns, we offered a few suggestions for the Committee to consider in their discussions on the issue. 

* *Testimonials and expert opinions:* We ask that individuals affected by this large breach of privacy be invited to provide testimonials in order for the Committees to gather necessary information it requires for it to take any necessary measures.
* *Need for disclosure:* There is need for engagement with the Government in order to obtain clarity on this deep violation of human rights. We ask that significant Government officials be invited to depose before the Committees in order to obtain transparency through official disclosure of these concerning series of events. 
* *Call for a moratorium:* In line with the key recommendation made by the report of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on freedom of opinion and expression, we request the Committee to publicly state the need for an immediate moratorium on the use or purchase of human rights violating surveillance technology by the Government until rigorous safeguards are put in place.

We hope the Committee has taken our inputs into consideration and addressed the looming concerns this incident has raised with regard to surveillance practices in India.

5652,"[Career Advice][IT] How to jump start and prepare for better job ?Hi,

I'm 25yro currently working in a Telecom domain MNC situated in Pune, as SW Test Engg. I've completed 3yrs and have mere CTC of 7LPA. This is my first stint and now i'm looking to switch only for the reason of getting a better package. I'll admit i haven't done any upskilling, as part of my job usually involved manual testing, and later on some automation using SOAPUI. I wish to know how i can, and in what direction should i proceed ?

My father as been bugging me to start preparing for CAT and do MBA, but i just don't feel like it will be worth as i've already spent last 7 years getting a degree and working a job in IT.

If i continue with the same career path, how can i prepare myself for interviews in this particular domain ? I haven't made Linkdn profile yet but do have Naukri.com profile on hidden mode. Unlike devs, i haven't performed coding or have proficiency in any particular language.

I'll appreciate comments from anyone who worked as manual tester to share their experiences.

Thx

5724,"Phrases to learn, how to avoid tourist prices, avoid sexual harassment & romance in IndiaHi,

So a friend of mine will be moving out to India (namely New Delhi), he and his British wife have visited as tourists before but this time they want to find a place to buy or rent for long periods of time.

They are going out with two other friends either looking to potentially buy a place together or near each other. 

They've invited me to go out with them to help them find a place and be an voice of reason :P I more than likely won't be moving out but hey who knows... I can do my work anywhere in the world as long as I have some form of internet so it's not out of the question.

# What words and phrases should we know?

We would love for an Indian or an expat to provide some us with some help with some common phrases that we should learn, I know my friend and his wife have learnt a fair bit of Punjabi and are still trying to learn some Hindi but for me and the other two friends we don't know any phrases.

# Any strategies to avoid sexual harassment for a female?

One of the friends that is going is female and she visited India when she was 15~ with her mum and dad and for her she is most worried about how some of the Indian men perv and harass her because when she was there before she had men who were way way older trying to hit on her, touch her and be overly forward with her dad having to tell them to leave her alone. She is stunning which probably doesn't help but are there any strategies to help her avoid this sort of behaviour?

# Romance?

The other friend that is going not long ago split from his girlfriend and wants to start a fresh in India but has no idea on the how things go down in India in regards to a romance... Are there certain things that are a big no no? Any obvious signs of someone using him for his wealth? He won't admit it but he's into one night stands... is this possible and likely in India? Any thing he should avoid?

# Costs and prices...

I know for me one of my concerns about India is not knowing prices/costs of things and how some Indians take advantage of this. 

For example, getting off the plane you leave the airport and all of the tuktuks are looking for Tourists so they can overcharge as a Tourist doesn't know the prices and just wants to get to a hotel after the long flight. I have been told to either tell them a price based on knowing how much it should cost or simply leave the airport and walk a little bit down the road where you can find tuk tuks who will do it way cheaper.

We'd love to know what sort of honest and rough prices we should be paying for things like:

- Breakfast
- Hotel stay
- Travel for 1KM
- Travel for 5KM
- A t-shirt
- A pair of sunglasses
- Loaf of bread
- Bottle of water

# Delhi Belly...

So as tourists we're always advised to never drink water / have ice in India unless it's been treated. Meat is also not recommended and we are told to visit the popular restaurants that have lots of people in as the food should be fresh and hot.
 
Should they slowly start to incorporate some riskier foods / drinks, like if they fall unwell a few times would they eventually be able to cope with some of these riskier items?

# Finding a local guide? 

Is it worth trying to find an honest, fair, trustworthy local person and pay them to guide us around the area, prices, culture... etc?

# Anything else?

Lastly, anything else we should all know? Enlighten us! We'd appreciate it :)

5739,"Dispelling the Myths 2: JNU, Swami Vivekananda and GraffitiHi! So as usual, events on campus at JNU have been selectively reported. I'd like to provide a counter-view about what is happening on campus regarding ""vandalism,"" JNU's history of graffiti as expression, and the Vivekananda ""statue.""


At the outset, I have to reiterate that the narrative right now is a distraction from the continuing struggle regarding the fee hike. That remains the core issue, but since this has come up, it should be addressed.

I also hope you read through the entire thing with an open mind. As always, I'll do my best to answer any questions and responses. I've hyperlinked evidence as much as possible.
 
**What's the deal with the Vivekananda Statue?**

in 2018, the Vice Chancellor and his team proposed to erect a statue of Swami Vivekananda in a position at the AD block opposite that of the current statue of Jawaharlal Nehru. There was no logic or reasoning to the proposal, which was protested by students on multiple grounds, but the admin went ahead and built the statue anyway.

JNUSU filed repeated RTIs to find the source of the funds for this statue, but the administration declined to provide details, only claiming that [""some alumnus""](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnu-statue-controversy/article25944561.ece) had donated the funds. At the same time, [reports](https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/students-union-s-rti-on-jnu-vivekanand-statue-draws-a-blank-119021000342_1.html) had come out that the Engineering Department (which is responsible for regulating any construction on campus) had not given clearance for the erection of the statue. Nor had an environmental impact assessment on the area been done, despite the fact that several trees had to be cut down to make space. As a result, the VC couldn't inaugurate the statue, and a saffron tarpaulin was put over it. 

So what we have right now is an illegal statue that has been covered with a saffron tarp for about 6 months now.


**Why did students vandalise and disrespect the Vivekananda Statue?**

1. The illegal statue itself was not vandalised - the base of the statue was.
2. If you read the slogans written, they are not directed at Vivekananda himself, but at the BJP/RSS/ABVP combine that has co-opted Vivekananda. The slogans read ""Fuck BJP,"" ""Fascism will Die,"" ""Bhagwa &"" ""Jalega"".
3. this act was not sanctioned by the protesters or by the union, which [put out a statement](https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/jnusu-distances-itself-from-defacement-row/article29976878.ece). 
4. the graffiti was immediately [cleaned up](https://imgur.com/gallery/iVeoIvF) within half an hour by some students themselves. This part is hardly being reported. 

Students recognised all of this as a distraction from the larger issue and sought to rectify it immediately, but by then the message had spread already. 


**Why is Graffiti such a big deal in JNU?**

Anyone who until recently came to JNU campus would have noticed the [beautiful posters](https://imgur.com/gallery/Q1UfCvD) put up on all the walls, by different political parties, groups, collectives, individuals, etc. There were posters and quotes of Ambedkar, Savarkar, Gandhi, Irom Sharmila, Nehru, Marx, Vivekananda, Subhash Chandra Bose, the list goes on. There's a famous saying by Eduardo Galeano - The walls are the publishers of the poor.  This history of using the walls as a canvas of opinion goes back to JNU's foundation: there's a famous story told on campus about how when one of the architects came to our first VC, G Parthasarathi, to tell him about students painting slogans on the walls, he laughed and said the walls belonged to the students, let them use them to voice their opinion. 


In August 2019, a notice was put out by the admin and JNU's ""Swachh"" team citing an arcane Delhi rule regarding public defacement as grounds to tear down all the posters. in the span of a week, almost all the posters were [torn down](https://imgur.com/gallery/tqznLIn), leaving an ugly mass of scratches and stuck paper, and half torn images.

This was a direct assault on an integral part of JNU's culture, and so the graffiti currently drawn in the AD block is seen as a response to that. It was done mostly with spray paint to prevent it from being torn down as easily as last time. Some of the pictures being painted are gorgeous, some of it is obscene, some of it thought provoking, and some of it simply provoking. But the general point is that it is a response to the administration curbing yet another part of campus culture. And this highlights the hypocrisy of the administration complaining about vandalism when they tore up pictures of freedom fighters and thinkers, and left ugly marks in their place.",1573832067.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,16

5779,"TIFU. Today I got fooled and had to pay 1000 for my stupidity.Happened just couple an hour back. So I was driving on my bike back to home. One person travelling by my side called out and told me that my rear tyre (tubeless) was low on air pressure. Just ahead there was a tyre repair shop.


So went there and checked, shopkeeper said that there might be a puncture. Told me to take the bike aside. So I took my bike in front of his  shop like he told. Then he told me to get bike in neutral to make it easy for him to check any puncture and I did like he told. 

He started checking for punctures and one after other he found total 11 punctures in the tyre. He demanded 1320 rupees (100 for each puncture). By this time it was quite clear that I'm getting duped. But there were total 4 big guys (including shopkeeper) against only me. I couldn't dare to confront them about it. So I haggled a bit and paid 1000.


I started driving again and after a couple of kilometres, stopped at another shop. Asked the kid working in that shop to check whether there were any punctures. He checked and there were not. I told him what had happened few minutes ago. He laughed a bit and said 'आपकी काटली उन लोगों ने' (Basically, 'They fooled you'). He told me the person who called out me at the start of all this gets 50% as commission for his work, and shopkeeper made punctures with his tool when i was shifting down the gear. He even guessed the area where it happened correctly. 


So feeling stupid.

TLDR: Guy shouted 'low pressure', shopkeeper was sneaky, got duped. Missing my 1000 rupees now.


Edit: This happened in Bopodi, Pune. Just before the signal. Giving the location just in case someone who travels on that road regularly reads this. Definitely avoid those tyre repair shops.",1573826622.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,109,445

My school-days were surprisingly egalitarian where I don't remember fellow students being judged on English speaking skills. But, from college onward, it was clear that the ""cool"" crowd were kids from metro cities (or were Dubai/US/UK returnees) who were good at English. Often, students from rural/tier-III town backgrounds would form groups of their own - and would be largely under-confident.

I can not take the high road here as even I have laughed at people for pronouncing words wrongly and mocked them behind their backs (I probably had different reasons for disliking these people but used their poor English-speaking skills as a weapon).

A few months back my uncle's daughter and her mother accused my sister of abusing her on facebook with a fake id and are making life a living hell for my family

They have no evidence that the fake id is of my sister and the claim she made that my sister admitted its her is false as there was nowhere where she said that the id was hers. Moreover the id was created way back in 2011 and back then even i didn't have a phone forget facebook. Basically they have no proof or substancial evidence that the id was of my sister and its just basically lies from her.

They threathen my father of making him go rounds of various police stations and they are just doing that, from the past few months my family has been to various police stations but nothing happens we even filed a complaint and had a receiving of it....they just go to another station and that station says us to be present at a specific time and does nothing when we go there ( the police is seriously a joke at this point ).

Regarding the background of my uncle's family is that they are complete psychopaths. They always fight with everyone be it in the streets on work or within themselves they just are lunatics....they break appliances and furnitures every other day at their own house if they are not fighting with someone outside.....their mother was once locked up for approx 3 hours for abusing a police officer and she has also consumed fenile and tried to kill herself because of her eldesr son....they have 3 sons and 1 daughter but none of them work and not even a single one of them even completed their high school education....they are devoid of logic and rationale as my father tried to throw away this matter but they are having none of it as they are utterly shameless and just want to fight for no reason.....i am unable to write what they have said about my sister and my family as it is really degenerate words from them.

My father is a very kind man with a good heart and it pains me to see him tense and skip meals because of this, my mother also has a condition and it pains me to see my family go through this.

What do i do....please someone help us....it would be greatly appreciated by me and my family.",1573746998.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,3,19

5863,"Do you really feel like coming home ?Before we proceed to the problem, let me tell you I'm (M29) an IT slave and I love my family.

My problem is that I don't feel like coming home. There's nothing to look forward to.
As soon as I step inside my mum starts bombarding me with questions. My dad is constantly watching the news or taking care of my grandma (she's partially bedridden). Again I love her, she's done so much for me, but it really tires me out because she has an onset of dementia and Alzheimers.

I never feel comfortable coming home. I directly go to my room, close the door and open my laptop.
The TV is super loud in the living room, when I say lower it down I either get a shitty back answer or I'm told to go inside my room. If I try to argue it boils down to ""I work the whole day and would like some entertainment and don't dominate me"" from mum if it's dad I'm just told to get out of the house since it's his house and his rules. For the volume, I'm always told they can't hear it. But that's super annoying, I mean c'mon get a hearing aid for god sake, this ain't the way.

Our house is always a mess because my parents thought they were interior designers. I know I should be grateful that we don't have any loans and that we could buy a house and for everything, but it's just a big mess. For e.g., My dad likes plants so our whole house and both the balconies are filled with pots. No symmetry no nothings just a bloody forest. It just annoys me that I can't even sit in my balcony.

P.S Please don't tell me to get out of the house, it's just not possible.
FYI My dad isn't someone who you could sit down and talk with, 99% of the time it's like talking to a statue, my mum just doesn't stop blabbering and in the end, she will end up taking his side and show me how I'm wrong.
I'm just looking for plausible advice, and some venting out.",1573757306.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,21,26

#HOPE

Humans are on the verge of self-annihilation.
We have destroyed nature.
We have destroyed morals.
We have crossed all the lines.
And we have hurt each other’s feelings.
The result?
A nature that is destroying us now.
An immoral society who couldn’t care less about the destruction.
The lines between right and wrong are getting blurred every day.
And every second person is on the verge of some kind of mental breakdown!

The question is: Is this damage irreversible?
Though we all must have faced certain situations that could have been much better if the world was a better place and we all must have felt the need to undo something which could have gone better but all of that is in the past!
So, YES some of the damage is irreversible BUT definitely NOT ALL OF IT, NOT YET!
We still have the option to make it right for the future generations (considering they are our collective future and not just someone else’s upcoming present).

Now the next question arises: Do people really care?
Well, people generally DON’T care about anything until it personally concerns them BUT from my perspective, PEOPLE ARE STILL GOOD.

Though there are people who care more about a temple/mosque feud than the economy and pollution in the country, but I’ve seen those same people standing for the rights of women when endangered!
There are people who might not see the need of women empowerment but those same people never hesitate to give a dime to a beggar on the street!
The people who don’t give a damn about the weaker strata of the society but always take care of the old man living in their houses.
And the people who might think of the dependent population as a burden but they never litter on the roads.

We all care about something. Maybe something not very prominent but we do care! And that shows people are good. Maybe their caring is also a part of a selfish goal but them caring for something in the first place shows that they are capable of caring selflessly too!
So, as long as there are people who care, there is hope!

Maybe it all will get worse for a while, but soon people will open their eyes. Maybe only when it will become their personal concern (as all of this is ultimately going to affect all of us) they will wake, but they will change!

Change for the greater good.
Change because they are capable.
And because PEOPLE ARE GOOD!

We just to peek inside our souls and ask “Is this the world we want?” and act accordingly before it’s too late.

5902,"Indian Art Schools are jokeA little side note, this post is not meant to offend or hurt anybody that is studying in art schools or practicing different arts or humanities. All these are based on assumptions and observation I made while leaning on my chair and researching things over the internet.

Art schools are expensive more than a regular college tuition fee. People are put on a conveyor belt for the whole 5 yrs time and then they are asked to join work at an untalented white guy who is only good at being popular. The part where creativity is induced or influenced is downright looked upon. Degree is worthless students get out of the college wanting to do something new/unique to their style representing their cultures, their belief, their imagination but are fired for thinking or doing something risky or new. There is everything standardized about what is to be done or your art must follow rules, called to have boundaries or just follow what the mainstream people have already done. Copy that. 

Nowadays people are taking a shorter path at doing thing. Whatever is popular gets recreated over and over till you start feeling choked on to your throat. For example there was a whole Tumblr wave on social media and Instagram where people were posting filtered pictures with a text quote here and there. Every girl that was into art suddenly became that aesthetic hoe. Indian students are loosing individuality there are struct between whether to keep on studying about someone else's culture or about the Indian culture what made them different in the first place or to even study about art in general. These colleges are not doing what they were supposed to do in the first place.

There is this cultural appropriation thing, students after learning from top colleges when apply these westerner principle or styles in real life, face backlash; they see the art style what was praised in the college is under performing or in simple words can not connect to masses which it was intent to. 

The art books are basically designed to cater to western masses while Indians and Indian Art is ignored. Students just study about Italian Renaissance more than they know anything Indian related. These schools were established as to preserve our rich heritage and art so that new generations would come and contribute to it. These schools are scam they should remove Indian from their names. Students are learning a bunch of dumb shit which has already been done and studied over hundred times.        

Art schools should work on making students creative having knowledge about everything. Courses must be design in such a manner that bring out the creativity, how to observe details and uses them in development of your own style . Art in my opinion is about perceptive showing that direction or expression through different medium.

In my opinion, Art colleges should give more freedom than having a set of rules for art. Let the students develop his personal image/style/skills irrespective of what syllabus says. These things only restrict imagination. Restricting imagination means restricting possibilities. Teach students how to have an individualistic mindset rather than following.",1573768938.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,8,12

After 4 years when I dont need it anymore I tried selling it. Most reputed Jewelers deny to trade as there is some sort of business rule that they don't trade diamond by others
Upon great request and pursual, I was quoted for 45000 by some other shop.

I went back to the original shop where I purchased this thing, same manager same shop now offers me 55000 for this same things.

I feel frustrated about this situation.
Want to know what could be my options, because I can not accept a loss of 30000 rupees despite increase in gold prices.

1. How is 2 months of unemployment proved? Is it just the fact that no contributions have been made to the EPF account in 2 months which means that the person is now unemployed?
2. How will this withdrawn amount be taxed? The tax percentage and will it be TDS?

6062,"What makes us so loud?Something that irks me (maybe its quarter-life crisis) is how there is just so much noise all around, everywhere I go. Vehicles unnecessarily honking, people talking extremely loudly on their phones, people talking loudly to each other in public transport, loud music being blared at festivals (religious/weddings, not your Music Festivals), and much more. Hell, I would even go on to say Indian uncle sneezes are the loudest!

If some nations are inherently quiet (the Japanese find it rude and stare at people talking loudly in public), some nations do not honk at all, unless absolutely necessary). My question is, what makes Indians like this?

This is not meant to be demeaning or condescending in any way. It is widely accepted that Indians have trouble saying ""No"", and this is commonly attributed to us being under colonial rule and suppression for a long time, thus being subservient by nature.

I am a Delhite living in Hyd, I am planning to purchase an air purifier  for my parents.

Q1) Would like to know how **relevant and practical** air purifier are?  
They can be efficient but how practical they are, given Delhi's problem is not for 1-2 weeks it's for 3-4 months.  
Be honest will you purchase it, given it's not practical to sit in a closed environment for 3-4 months.

Q2) Did you see any noticeable change in your and your family's well being after purchasing one?  
Be honest, did you purchase them because they suddenly became popular.

**Advice preferably from doctor**, if one stays in purified air for 6-7 hours(practical scenario), and roam around for 18-17 hours. Is purified air worth paying for??

The street were I live is very narrow. There was a garbage truck in the street and it was covering more than half of the width and the remaining space was patched with cement. So I decided to wait till the truck moves ahead. The cement patch was blocked with small stones around it (typical Indian replacement for safety cones) and the patch wasn't new. So the civic worker told me to go on it, I thought, *yea sure, idk how long these guys will take. i should go*. While going on the small stone, my vehicle slipped a little, just a little, I could totally handle it and I did. And I moved ahead, no problem.  

Here comes the real matter, This was being watched by this old lady from next door. I got off my scooter and put my helmet inside. 

The lady told me *Why didn't you ask him to move the stones for you?*, I replied *because it's not his job and he was busy*. 

The lady said *you slipped there, you could have fallen down and could have got your head cracked open*, i replied that *I handled it and I didn't fall*.

Lady: ""but you could have, you should have told that *untouchable* to move that stone. it's his job because he's blocking the way with his *untouchable vehicle*"". 

What is with this country? People from the general communities want to stop reservations but also want to discriminate some people as lower than them. On the other hand, people who are considered as lower communities want reservation but also do not want to be considered as low. 

I am not on the either side. I just want to go on with my life. Both sides should fucking figure it out before the next generation is infected with this virus which brings the idea of castes into their mind.

Unlike what a lot of people say, I've never felt that Delhi is unsafe, though that might also be because of the areas I've lived in. I also felt that Delhi is a lot more open than most cities I've lived in.

In terms of infrastructure, I believe Delhi is miles ahead of most other metros. The metro is obviously incredible, but Delhi also has better roads and hence, better traffic than most other cities. You can drive 20kms in an hour in Delhi. I can reach the airport, located 21km from my house, in under 40 minutes. You can't do that in Bangalore or Mumbai.

Honestly, I don't want to leave this place.

But the pollution is just taking a toll on my health. I'm sick all the time, especially once winter starts. 

5 years ago when pollution became a real problem, I thought it was temporary. 

This year, its been 2 weeks of nonstop pollution that refuses to go away. I've now started believing that this is a permanent state of affairs. I see no political action except for some hand wringing and lip service and stupid schemes.

6196,"Dispelling the Myths: JNU's Fee Hike ProtestsHi! 

There are a lot of false reports circulating about JNU's fee hike protests, about the reported roll-back, about wasting taxpayer's money, etc etc. I wanted to take some time to dispel some of these myths. I'm providing a general outline of what's happening, but please feel free to ask any and all questions regarding JNU's current protests. I will answer everything I possibly can.


**Q1: What is going on in JNU right now?**

A: JNU has a student body of about 8000 students, the majority of whom stay on campus. Till recently, JNU has had low hostel fees, which has allowed students from all walks of life, particularly marginalised, minority, and impoverished communities, to attend. In addition, JNU has normally had a very liberal atmosphere - there are no enforced curfew timings, the entire campus is accessible, etc. 

Recently, the Inter-Hostel Administration (IHA) held a meeting in which a decision was made to pass the new draft hostel manual for hostel residents. normally, IHA meetings require the presence of the Students Union, and the Hostel Presidents - but this meeting was held *without* any student representation. The IHA said that JNUSU had not yet been notified because of a court case (completely false - the courts had in fact told JNU to hurry up and release the election results); and the Presidents had simply either not been called or not been elected yet. 

The draft manual has regressive rules - ""appropriate dress"" for students in the hostels, curfew timings, etc. These rules were there earlier but not enforced, but the decision to continue to include them (especially when read in the light of recent moves regarding campus security) was obviously of great concern.

The biggest issue, however, was the nature of the hostel fee hike. Earlier fees were as follows: 

Room Rent - 10/20pm (double/single room)
Mess Bill - 2000-3000pm
Utility and workers' salaries - 0. This was paid from JNU's budget. 
Total amount: 2500-3000pm.


Under the new rules:
Room Rent - 600/300pm (single/double room)
Mess Bill - 2000-3000pm
Utility and workers' salaries - to be included. one estimate pegs this at between 2000 and 3000pm.
So what was earlier a monthly bill of 3k is now between 5-6k.

As per JNU's 2017-18 Annual Report, about 40% of JNU's students come from families with a monthly income of less than 10k. JNU provides some Merit-cum-Means scholarships of about 2k-5k depending on what course is being pursued. The fee hike means that some 40% of students' futures are jeopardised because they won't be able to afford the hostel fees. That earlier ability of students of all castes and classes being able to attend college together is at stake, and so we're protesting.



**Q2: So what exactly are students protesting against?**

Students are protesting the following:
1. The fee hike, which puts at least 40% of students' continued academic study at jeopardy
2. The regressive elements of the manual, such as curfew timings and ""appropriate dress""
3. The new manual removes reservations for SC/ST/OBC students
4. The refusal by the administration and the Vice Chancellor, Mamidala Jagdish Kumar, to allow student representatives to attend meetings on decisions that directly affect them, despite repeated directions from the Ministry and the courts to do so. 
5. The curtailment of campus spaces - Areas that were earlier open 24hrs have been shut, access to reading rooms restricted, etc.
6. A long list of other issues.


**Q3: But I saw that a roll-back of the fees happened, so why are people still protesting?**

This is a lie.

On Wednesday morning, an Executive Council meeting was supposed to happen on campus at the convention centre - a meeting to decide various matters by a panel which includes Administration, Registrars, and Teacher representatives. Students had gathered to protest the meeting, as did teachers who sought to convince their colleagues to vote against the proposed agenda. Instead, what happened was that the vice chancellor secretly rescheduled the meeting to an undisclosed location, sent cars to pick up EC members without telling them where the meeting was happening, and then locked the gates to campus to prevent vehicles from exiting until after the meeting was held. at 12:10, a notice came out saying the meeting would be held at 12:30PM at a location 45 minutes away from JNU. 

Here, the decision was made to continue with the fee hike, but reduce the hiked amount (only the hiked amount, not the base amount) by 50% for BPL (NOT EWS NOR SC/ST) students. Note: BPL certificate as per digital India's website is issued for annual income less than 27k. This means that 30% of students are still jeopardised. So there has been no substantial, meaningful roll-back. 


So, protests are continuing. 

**Q4: Why is only JNU Protesting? Why is JNU constantly in the news?**

JNU is not the only university protesting. BITS-Pilani had a fee-hike protest over the summer. IIT students have been protesting the fee hike in MTech degrees. TISS has had protests, IIT-BHU has had protests, there are at least 15 different fee-hike or other- protests happening in universities around the country right now. 


**Q5: Why should JNU get special treatment?**

Ask yourself the more important question: Why shouldn't other universities get more fair treatment? Higher education is being treated like a private good, rather than a public good, and students have been paying more fees for less services across the country. If you're in a university that you feel you're paying far too much for to get far too little out of, you should ask yourself: Why am I okay with this? And consider joining in voicing your own disatisfaction for what's happening in your own individual campus. We are 8000 students on campus, but there are hundreds of thousands who are suffering from this same problem across the country. 


**Q6: Why not just take out a loan?**

Firstly because education loans are not that easy to get, even when they don't require collateral due to structural issues - financial inclusion, denial of loans, lack of access, etc. 

Secondly, because encouraging an education system to shift from a tax-funded to a loan-funded system is a recipe for fiscal and economic disaster. The US is a textbook case for the result of an escalating student-loan-based education system. Part of Chile's current problems trace back to the privatisation of their higher education system and escalating loan and repayment issues. Even Australia's income-contingent loan system has recently been shaken, because these systems only work so long as the economy as a whole expands and jobs continue to grow. When that doesn't happen, it becomes just more kindling to an already roaring fire. 

Thirdly, because we reject the idea that higher education is a private good that only benefits the individual. like primary and secondary education, it is a public good that the government should be actively investing in.

I spoke to a couple of drivers who literally berated me for paying via card. Their problem is they don't get the exact amount after the trip. To add to that, they receive the amount after 3-10 days which makes it difficult for their day to day expenses. 

I started using card because I had terrible experiences of drivers simply claiming they don't have change and drive off with anywhere between ₹30-50 as ""tips"".

Yet my cousin messages me and talks to me, we hang out about once every 6 weeks.  I messaged him asked did you sell the property and he goes yes its a surprise I was going to buy another piece of land in the city... I go i'm offended you would sell this without my consent and where is my money and I said I cannot trust him anymore and he got pissed off that i'm ruining his plans and its not a big deal.  Its not allot of money but at the end of the day he goes he is out of the deal and the deposit was only given and for me to figure out how to sell it.. 

this weekend there is a family prayer that he is hosting.. would you go there? or meet him face to face in a week times and go what the hell.. his last message was that i'm arguing about this and that he does not want to fight... He thinks I should be mad, but i'm so upset that someone can go behind my back and sell a piece of land without telling me and then make plans for it... I guess readers help me understand as what to do.. do I even bother meeting with this fool or just move on without this family.. my dad and uncle had both passed away, I have no parents and my cousin thinks because I'm on my own, its up to him to make the decisions.. but i'm independent and not letting this slide.",1573690920.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,17

6281,"[Advice] Eng. student (3rd year), failing some subjects this sem. Wanted to ask some questions.I will be probably getting some backlogs this sem. The other four sems went average and now i had a CGPA of around 7.9.

This year i dont know what happened to me, just slided away from my regular course of studying and everything went down in the drain. Some part me want to regret what i have done but no use doing that now. People say that having backlogs in 3rd year is really bad. I have done the very thing i tried to avoid.

Companies are coming for internships, they asking for CGPA above 8 and 8.5, which i dont have and wont come in the near future. Probably wont get any internships from companies coming to  my collage. But taking internships from outside, as i have heard is just doing what they ask you like cleaning and stuff. No technical skills required i guess and most of them are paid internships.

My questions are,

1. I wanted to get jobs in public sector like BHEL ,BEL ,ect , is **GATE** score enough for all of these or should i show my marks card  ( marked as failed in some subjects, which companies that come to interview in my collage will reject it as soon as they see my CV ) ?
2. Is internship really necessary ( I would have fasttrack exams in the holiday periods ) ? Can i do some  courses online for learning ?
3. How good are open-source companies in India ?
4. My main aim was to become a sysadmin or a linux kernel dev for any linux based companies (*Red Hat*)after four years of engineering. Any sysadmin here willing to guide me on how to join some compaines like this ? Is the certification provided by *Red Hat* like the RHCE  gonna land me to any job ?

I am not getting any interview calls with these skills (I have also worked on C#, C, Java etc. but I would not call myself an expert in it).. I should have started learning new technologies earlier, but for various reasons I could not.. 


I am planning to ramp up on Python. What else should I learn along with it?


This is the rough plan I have:

1. Learn Python

2. Learn NoSQl

3. Learn Microservices

4. Learn Dockers

5. Create a project that solves real world problems and publish on Github.

Writing it off as colonial hangover is easy - but, does it fully explain the phenomenon? Was there a preference for fair skin in India 200/300 years ago as well?

What  is surprising is that I've seen preference for fairness in very young  children as well. My mom is someone who has always been conventionally  beautiful by Indian standards - thin, with fair skin and good facial  features. I have seen even kids as young as 1.5/2 years old, who are meeting her for the first time, prefer to cling on to her as opposed to my other aunts/cousins who are not as fair.

6350,"[NP] Love-Arrange marriage and dowry. Stuck between a rock and a hard placeMe and my girlfriend met in our office. After a couple of years of dating, we decided to break the news to our parents about our marriage. My parents love her and are fine with our marriage but her parents aren't so happy. They don't mind the alliance but they have been very critical of my lifestyle and earning. After working for 7 years, I take home 12lpa in hand. I'm going to change the job soon and it looks like I will probably take home more than 15 lakhs. 
She's from a upper middle class family and her father wants to maintain that status even after his death. My girlfriend is his only child. He initially didn't want his daughter to work after marriage but we somehow convinced him that she'll do some freelance working while sitting at home. This way, she won't have to go to office and she will be able to take care of our future kid. 
Now, here comes the difficult part. My parents are against any form of dowry, not even gifts but as my girlfriend's dad wants to maintain his status(he also wants to show off to his relatives how much he spent on his only child's wedding)and he's willing to give us a car, some jewellery, a 2bhk apartment in Mumbai and 2 crores. After hearing this, my parents refused the alliance as it goes against their moral principles but my girlfriend's dad is stubborn. 

What am I supposed to do in this case? My parents and her dad aren't talking to each other and I'm almost 30. I don't want to break up with her because of this stupid matter. What steps should I take next?",1573627152.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,22,17

&#x200B;

I am working in IBM as IT engineer. As per company policy, we get 22 Paid leaves and unlimited sick leaves(need to submit proof).  But there is  caveat  of billable utilization; you need to maintain utilization above 103% quarterly. 

The utilization calculation formula counts  public holidays as same as personal leaves, and as per govt policy we get mandatory 10 days public holiday. 

One of colleague is put in Performance improvement program(PIP) because he  had taken 2 weeks unplanned leaves as his father died. Management and HR had forced him to resign, when we are not able to secure weekend billing. 

Now, my manager are forcing me to ask client for weekend billing or cancel my approved 5 working days leaves, because client is asking for 2 weeks mandatory furlough in December.  I have refused to change  my plans, as tickets and hotel booking is already booked. 

My manager is  threatening  with dire consequences (up to Termination) .

Me and this girl we met through these online matrimonial platform and it hit off for us and we started dating and eventually involved the parents and did the usual roka stuff and other marriage preparations are ongoing. 

The thing is my family is strictly conservative and follow all the rituals to the core , right down to the very last detail while her family is very liberal and only believe in rituals they can follow otherwise not. 

Before marriage she wants to visit my house as she has never been here and is fond of dogs and In general wants to establish more friendlier relationship with my family by visiting them and I am pretty cool about it. 

The issue comes when I tell my family and they go by the ritual that the girl should not visit the guys family before marriage. Due to this rigidness , I am caught in this complex matrix of having to maintain both sides and fear that these issues will become bigger as the time comes because of ideological differences and I stand here with the girl because I am not rigid with these rituals 

How do I go about convincing my family to be a little more open and flexible and understand someone's genuine desire to be involved with my family.

Edit : The reason she wants to visit my house is because I have a dog and she is very very fond of the dogs. We have decided to live separately to our parents because I feel we need our own personal space to build this life together",1573613805.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,59,108

6436,"If not fairness creams it will always be something elseSeeing all these posts mocking fairness creams, I want to make an **unpopular** argument. True, it is not very right to market products that try to alter one's physical appearance, something no one chose while being born. No one decided whether to become fat, thin, dark, fair, bald, curly hair, wide hips, small breasts, whatever. It's not fair.

But society will always consider one trait better than other. I lost hair at 19 and shaved my head since then. Not one person has in person told me that I did a good thing. Every one suggests that I apply some oil, or take a tablet or even wear a wig or do an ugly comb over. I have made peace with the fact that my life would have been better with hair. I have made peace with the fact that people will never stop making jokes. I have made peace that I will be slightly unhappier without hair. The only thing I can do is compensate by earning more money, being fit, being positive. The Dr Batra hair loss ads will not stop. The scam hair loss industry that earns off of desperate young men will never stop.

Like that, I don't think the fairness thing will ever go away in India until we become a developed country and we don't have to look up to western countries full of white people. Even then we will pick up some other fad.

**The day when it is not really ""cool"" to emigrate to USA or Canada is the day the fairness ads will stop.**",1573625091.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,46,142

She keeps showing up every evening at my house to watch TV serial and everytime she comes over my  mom has to provide her with tea and food and sometimes my dad has to buy her wada pav and stuff and some more if she shows up with her grandchildren also. This has been going on for 7 years. 

Usually it was subtle but this she has gone full shameless and says without hesitation ""Arey mujhe zara khana dena, zara vada pav la do"". It's not like she's poor and all she is 3 times richer than my average family. But still in her age she is shameless enough to come to my house and demand and behaves like this.

My mom in her old age needs rest most of the time of the day as recommended by doctors due to multiple surgeries that has gone through. My dad will do whatever that old aunty say because she has an emotional leash around my dad's neck which she has been exploiting for decades.

She herself being an old women knows my mom can't do much but she comes over and expect hospitality. Didn't she get the social cues ?, why is she doing this ? This bitch says that there is nothing else to do, and she will just watch TV and leave and so she comes to my house for refreshment  but the truth is she don't want to pay for the maid who will feed her grandchildren and look after her them as everyone in the house is going to office. Hence my mom have put up with all that shit. 

I have made clear in past week that i don't like her by refusing to turn on the TV. Even after that drama she still comes over every evening being a shameless hag she says that, ""aaj mekn teko pareshan karne aai hu"" and literally annoys me by saying you should respect your grandmother, which she isn't. 

Even with saying to the face that i don't want you in my house she comes over, What should I do ? What should I do to keep her permanently away until her weird ass goes to heaven that she keeps preaching ?

6546,"What do you guys think about the Indian Web Serieses coming out lately? Any actual good suggestions?TBH , TVF' s content is over rated.

Pitchers was like a rip off of Silicon Valley but only ended really poorly. What the fuck was that? Do VCs actually give their money based on emotional presentations? And guess what , they did the same trope twice on the show? What! 

It was a begining definitely. But the newer TVF shows are also not that great. 

Flames definitely was a stand out. 

So was Lankhon me Ek on Prime. Family Man was also good but still had that Bollywood feel to it. 

After Sacred Games, I don't think any good Netflix India content had come out lately.

Balaji ALT is just that local porn theater playing Indian soft core porn where they are even afraid to show any frontal nudity ( which they did on Sacred Games, which wasn't even an erotic show to begin with ) 

Which shows did you like ? Which you didn't? 

Here is my list -
 1. Good :

Lankhon Me Ek S1

Baked 

Aadha 24 

Sacred Games ( yes I think S2 was better than S1, I know)

Family Man

FLAMES

Tripling S1

Humourously Yours S1

Little Things

2. Meh. Overrated even.

Pitchers

Kota Factory

Permanent Roomates

Tripling S2

Aisha

I'mmature

Humorously Yours S2

Yeh Meri Family

However, given the fact that it is something that can not be quickly verified (unlike a physical diseases), it always opens up doors of being abused. There are people who fake depression for sympathy. I have seen, first hand, a friend who whiled away his time partying, going out and playing video games cry depression and fake being suicidal to ensure that his project guide gets scared and allows him time to submit a sub-standard output instead of giving a project extension and holding him back for a semester. How do I know that he faked it? Because he told me that he would fake it before it actually happened and laughed at how he managed to manipulate the situation to his advantage afterwards.

So, can someone please tell us how can you figure out if depression is real or fake or even imagined (wherein the person is not depressed, but, thinks that he/she is because they read a lot of depression-related content and think that they are in depression) ?

&#x200B;

Two friends and I are visiting India in December. Below is our planned itinerary. All transport is planned on sleeper trains:

&#x200B;

14 December: Arrive in Mumbai. Depart for Goa (stay in Baga beach or similar).

16 December: Depart Goa in the evening for Hampi.

18 December: Depart Hampi in the evening for Mysore/Mysuru.

20 December: Depart Mysore/Mysuru for Munnar.

23 December: Depart Munnar for Aleppey. Take a houseboat trip and potentially stay in Kumarakom for a night or on the houseboat.

25/26 December: Depart Aleppey for Varkala.

27 December: Fly from Trivandrum to Mumbai.

28 December: Depart to Aurangabad, visit the Ellora Caves and perhaps some others.

29 December: Return to Mumbai.

30 December: Day tour to Lonavala view points.

31 December: End.

&#x200B;

Do you think this is a viable route?

I also had some questions on trains and the houseboat: 

Why is sleeper class so much cheaper than second class? We would like to spend our transport times sleeping on trains instead of travelling during the day. 

Is it necessary to book in advance?

Do you have any recommendations on specific houseboat providers? We have already received some quite expensive quotes and are trying to keep it under Rs15000 for the three of us.

But, why fight it. This kind of sentence formation makes total sense when you are familiar with Indian languages and you as a listener and the speaker know what does it means. may be if this is accepted more, we will start seeing it in the written language as well.

Let's make this type of sentence construction, a standard part of ""Indian English"".

As more and more Indians speak English, I believe we have the right and the duty to modify the language in ways which best suits us.

6643,"[R]Why Owaisi is now relevant to me.TLDR: Because there is no alternative.

A few days before the results of the 2015 Delhi elections came out, a Hindu lady I was speaking to about the ongoing Ghar Wapsi controversies, remarked that Owaisi made a lot of sense when he retorted that since Islam states that every one is born a Muslim, hindu's that convert to Islam would actually qualify for 'Ghar Wapasi'. 

I was in the middle of Atheist enlightenment phase of my life and I scoffed at her. Owaisi was just one more religious rabble rouser, I said. She reiterated: It makes sense within the religious context, because both sides aim to use a religion argument. I agreed to that while still chuckling at what I saw as a non-meritorious argument.


When the Babri Masjid verdict came out on Saturday, my first reaction was to google what Muslim leaders thought of the verdict. It had never bothered me before that there was none I found remotely interesting or even appealing, but it did now. I sadly googled the relevant keywords followed by Owaisi and refresh the page a few times hoping something would come up.

It was as if I was in the Chappelle skit, mockingly calling for Ja Rule to make sense of the disaster that was hurricane Katrina(?) - except that it was in total earnestness. Such is the state of my community that we have so few representatives - some of which have happily sold themselves to the saffron. 

I've since accepted that for even if only for the current period of time, he is the one Muslim politician that I look at as a leader. 


I imagine so many hindus must gravitate towards Modi with a similar distaste of the available hindu leaders, but if in a country with a billion people of your community, a community that has representation across financial and political spectrum and the best man you find to look upto as a leader is a fella previously accused of genocide - let off only because he destroyed the evidence, I'd say that your reasons for looking upto him are suspect. 


So here I am. A decidedly non practicing Muslim that now follows Owaisi's political career with quite some interest. I might even vote for him given the chance. Either way, i'm rooting for him. 

I understand that this post will attract a lot of negative attention, so I've marked it [R]. I'm not here to fight, but if thats how you see things, So be it.",1573573526.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,30,0

A week Before Diwali i ordered a camera kit from amazon for Rs. 82093 and the camera was delivered without the camera  lens. They wrongly labelled the camera body box as one containing the lens even though the package contents clearly say it is the camera body box only which costs about 20k cheaper than the kit i ordered.

I complained to amazon the day it was delivered , they replied that their concern team will look into it. 6 days later the concern team claims that they have sent the correct package and hence they will not return or refund it.

I have mailed the company several times along with the photos of the wrong  package as well as the video recorded by the delivery person of the wrong package being opened by me. The company has not bothered to look at my photos or video and have replied the same to each email the same i.e. that they wont return or refund it, even though i have showed them proof that the wrong item was sent by them.

I have complained to the national forum as well, they too without looking at the evidence have considered that the right item was sent just by listening to amazon's account of the story.

I am helpless now, we saved up for 2 years to buy a camera and now we have been wronged by one of the biggest companies in the world who are getting away with this.

After coming back, I applied for an Aadhar card thrice but it was rejected all 3 times. For the first 2 attempts, I provided 2 different documents - my passport as proof of identity and proof of birthdate. For proof of address, I provided a bank statement from HDFC.
  
For the 3rd attempt, at a different enrollment center, the operator said that the passport alone would suffice as proof of identity, address, and birthdate. This operator seemed more knowledgeable than the one I had in my first 2 attempts so I assumed I was in good hands. Sadly this application was also rejected. 
  
I reached out to UIDAI for reason of rejection each time and every time their reply was ""incorrect documents"". I am not sure how to proceed now. Has anyone had a similar experience? Appreciate any tips/suggestions. 

Clarification: I live (& applied for the Aadhar card) in a different city than the one on my address on my passport. I was assured by the enrollment operator that it would not be an issue and that the Aadhar card would have my passport address as the main address and it would be mailed there. Would it make a difference if I was to apply for the Aadhar card in the same city as listed on my passport?

6728,"Faith win over Facts?I know the verdict has already been passed but this is an opinion that is being hidden and left behind. I would kindly suggest you to read it and provide a rational argument in favor or against it. 

The Masjid belonged to the **Sunni** and it was not constructed after **demolishing a Ram templ**e that was claimed to have been there. This **false narrativ**e was not only responsible for galvanizing the ordinary Hindus but also gave some sort of **legitimacy to divisive electoral politics**. The court hence rejected the **Hindu rights narrative** of the Babri mosque.

Muslim grievances about the trespass in 1949 and the tragic demolition of the mosque in 1992 were accepted by the court. In fact, the court had accepted that there was an injury caused to them — i.e. **violation of their legal rights.**

The Ayodhya dispute rather began in **1886** and not in the time of **Babar.** The litigation in the British court was about building a canopy in the chabutra area. The courts at that time denied MR Das this acquisition and asked them to remain in the **status quo**. That is: **the Muslims would pray inside the Babri Masjid while the Hindus had limited rights to pray at the chabutra.** Surprisingly, the apex court has rejected the title of Muslims for want of proof of title document.  The gazetteer and the British documents were all nullified.

In law, the phrase “status quo” means **the situation at the time of the judgment must not be changed**. The Babri litigation is a story of changing the **“status quo”.** 

On the night of December 22-23, 1949, trespassers placed **Lord Ram’s idol under the central dome of the Babri Masjid**. In a few days after the incident, a **new status quo would be sanctified** by the local courts: Muslims were not allowed to pray inside the mosque, the idol would not be removed, and that Hindus would have a “limited” right to pray and pujaris would ensure daily bhog. *By one act of criminal trespass, a mosque was converted into a temple.* 

The demolition of the mosque on December 6, 1992, was also the **destruction of the rule of law**. The SC has rightly criticized it and accepted that it was in **violation of the “status quo” order passed by it**. Within a few hours of the mosque’s demolition, a makeshift temple had come up at the structure’s location. Within a month of the demolition, the Allahabad High Court allowed for darshan at the makeshift temple. In 1994, the Supreme Court, while dealing with the Acquisition of Certain Areas of Ayodhya Act, ordered the protection of the latest “status quo”: No mosque but a makeshift temple and legally protected darshan at the site. 

The joint ownership was rightly ruled out.

6774,"An analysis of ""Hey! Ram"" and its relevance todayI'm not sure if the flair is appropriate, but I guess this post is a bit political.

Recently, Kamal Haasan had a special screening of ""Hey! Ram"" - a movie that I watched way back in 2000 when it had released, but I was too young to understand the movie completely. Back then, the movie was known for its English dialogues, kissing scenes and eroticism - and was mostly jeered by the general public. The movie was financially a failure. 

I came across a video on YouTube where someone had posted a sort of an appreciation for the movie - and also mentioned that it had released on Amazon Prime. I decided it was time to properly watch the movie, now that I am old enough to understand the message within the movie.

I just finished watching it and I am astonished by how relevant the movie is today. In an almost embarrassing line, Kamal Haasan's character says ""innuma?"" (even now?) when he's told that there is a Hindu Muslim riot going on (6-Dec-1999). The sad fact is, that line applies to today as well. If you're curious about the movie, it is about how Saket Ram - a man who loses his wife to Hindu-Muslim riots in erstwhile Calcutta, goes about his revenge against Gandhi - the man he believes is responsible for his wife's death. 

In a recent speech, Kamal Haasan said if we can uncover the reason why people have a fanatic agenda towards others, then that's our key to peace - to understand why there is an anger. To a certain extent, the movie has managed to do it. It does not take sides and takes digs at Jinnah and Gandhi alike, while of course focusing on the extreme right-wing. 

I strongly suggest you watch the movie if you haven't watched it. If you've watched it, please watch it again! You'll see why - it was definitely ahead of its time, and I doubt if Kamal Haasan himself has met these standards since then. It is available on Amazon Prime if you have a subscription. Or you can watch it on YouTube if it is available. It is available in many languages (it was made in Hindi as well). 

TL;DR - I recently watched the movie ""Hey! Ram"" and loved it - suggest you to watch it if you can.",1573547779.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,8,25

6779,"Kind of 'Dated' a girl, got the trauma for life. Feeling threatened and suicidal. What to do next ?I dated a girl through a dating app and started liking her. After few months I became emotionally attached to her and maybe I thought she started liking me as well. I kind of thought the feeling was mutual and started messaging her on whatsapp and all. We drifted after few months and kind of became strangers again. Me being from a middle class family never have been much with girls so I can't read minds of girls well.

I kind of tried messaging that girl again but on different social media platforms thinking I was in good terms with her. She may have felt pestered and blocked me. I just wanted to know the reason and she wasn't even ready to say a goodbye properly. It made me feel confused and I tried even more to know the reason via mail and all and also confessed my feelings. I kind of became OCD with her. This might have sparked the feeling of suspicion in her regarding my intentions. She probably complained in cybercell.

These people planned to test my intentions and I kind of obliged with 'nasty' pics and videos. This made me even further sick of myself as I already have depression due to childhood sexual abuse. I started feeling depressed with things happening to me. I sent her a video for a 'treat' which was 'kind' of discussed. After which she threatened me with police actions maybe because she thought. And since then on I have been severely damaged.

That video might have made her feel harassed and I kind of have suffered the worst kind of mental breakdown. Gave several kind of abuses to her over several ids.  Have sent her some really bad and threatening images out of frustration and anger. AM SORRY that she has to go through all this but I feel PHYSICALLY and EMOTIONALLY ABUSED. Am on medical treatment. I cry, I feel suicidal. I feel bad for people who misunderstand intentions. I never had bad intentions for anyone but after my mental breakdown I am just sitting at home and hardly work or interact with people. Life has become hard.

Recently discovered an IG profile through a Pinterest post that helps women and I contacted that id with an intention of donating to lessen my guilt. I feel its of same girl and it has sparked a flood of fear and remorse in me. I feel am blot on my family and got worse kind of scars. I feel am going to be jailed soon. Am breaking down.

AM SORRY to you girl that I ever contacted you. I am not stalking you or contacting you. I have my life to live and am MINDING my OWN Business. Please SPARE me.",1573503495.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,28,3

6909,"Sending proposal for two girl's families at same time.I am 35M/Muslim. Last year I broke up with my long-time GF, after dealing with depression and sobering up to fact I am not anymore fit for dating business. I decided to get married through [shaadi.com](https://shaadi.com). Started talking to a girl (30F) in Sept through the portal and met her when I came to India 3 weeks back. After that met her father as well. All things seemed good. I introduced my father to her father and they are planning to meet soon. My parents haven't yet met the girl as well.

During my India visit, I also met my sister's sister-in-law (27F). They are family friends. I have always liked her but this time it was different. I actually fancied her. Now I am not able to get her out of my mind. I know her for a very long time, know her nature, she will fit really well with the family. Also, in 2015 after getting my laser lasik done, I recommended it for her as well. Unfortunately, it didn't go all well for her.  One of her eye retinae moved. She lives in Kanpur/UP where people judge these things. I have been told by my family, People may not be up for accepting of a girl with a ""defective"" eye. That also makes me sad. Anyways all said, Mine and her family will have no objections if I send my family with my proposal for her. 

So I am conflicted. I haven't made any promises to the first girl but we have been talking for the past 3 months and I met her father so that creates certain expectations. Will it be wrong to say no to her after leading her on for 3 months? Also, I have always maintained >4-5 years the age gap between a couple is not good as people have different life goals at such a big age gap. Is it okay to talk to my family about my interest in second girl? 

tldr: Talking to one girl for arrange marriage but crushing on another younger girl. should i tell no to first girl? if yes, how? is 8 years age difference acceptable?",1573506062.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,9

7000,"I(21F)Can't decide if my bf(28M) is showing red flags and doesn't respect me enough or if I'm being too insecure and not trusting him enoughHey ladies and gentlemen!

I need some urgent advice about my relationship as soon as possible.I've been a member of this subreddit for quite sometime now,and I've noticed you guys giving awesome advice to eachother.

I(21F) met my boyfriend(28M) an year and a half ago.Basically,I signed up on a dating site for the first time ever and deactivated it within 3 days.He saw me on there and found me on facebook.We chatted for a bit and he asked me out.He's met my dad and I've met his mom and we are both serious about getting married in the near future.

So I'm from a South Asian Muslim background and he's from a south asian hindu background.He's not religious at all,I am a bit religious,not too much though,and the religious differences don't bother me a bit.

Last year,my boyfriend/s coworker/female friend had a bad date(she invited a guy to her place,got drunk,he wanted to have sex and she refused,so he left).She asked my bf to hangout with her at 3 am on the same night because she was upset her date left.He told me about this and went to her place,then they went to the beach.I got uncomfortable and asked my bf if I could speak to her.He told me I could message her on fb and I did,politely asking her about what happened that night.She got really upset,made a very racist comment about me to my bf and after replying ""Nothing happened.We just hung out.He's a friend of mine"" blocked me.Then she kept texting my bf to ask how I'm doing(my boyfriend told me).I asked him why he didn't defend me and he said ""I couldn't attack her because she is a girl.I didn't want to make things awkward at office"".

I asked him to please stop all nonwork related contact with her and he agreed.She's still following him on instagram though.

So,here's the thing.Whenever I've brought up any concerns regarding this relationship in the past,my boyfriend has done all he could to ease my mind.Recently,he made a new group of friends he plays sports with every weekend.They're all Indian,so my bf gets along with them really well.They've begun to invite him out to bars and nightclub parties almost every week now.Last weekend,they invited him to a bollywood party at a nightclub in LA.The guys went with their girlfriends,and my bf knew very well I couldn't accompany him since I live at home with my parents and I'm not allowed to go out to clubs and bars until I have my own place.He asked me if I'm okay with it and I told him to go and have fun.He then told me all about how his friends got black out drunk.

Also,Him and a good college friend of his vacationed in las vegas last year for a weekend.Before he left,he kept telling me his friend was going to hire an escort and visit strip clubs(bf said the most he'd do is probably get a lap dance at a strip club just for his friend).They rented a car together and bf told me his friend wants to pick up girls in the ferrari.Before he left I told him I'm not comfortable with these kind of activities but asked him to enjoy the trip.Once he got back I asked him about his trip and he didn't mention escorts or strip clubs.I asked him about his friend and he said his friend didn't get an escort.

My bf just told me yesterday that he's planning on spending new year's eve with the same friend this year in miami.I am very concerned because I honestly don't think this friend is a good influence.I haven't brought this up to my bf yet.

I've just been thinking about this alot lately.Do you think marrying someone who stays at their friend's place until 3 am at night doing sheesha/hookah and going out to bars and clubs and drinking until 4 am and vacationing in Las Vegas is a good idea?Is this lifestyle common for people in the United States?Am I being too conservative/inflexible?

Any advice,or your thoughts,anything at all would really help!

7008,"is india truly a democracy?when i say the word democracy what comes to to your mind ? is it the representative form of government, or is it the by the people of the people and for the people statement . according to me it’s the greatest authoritative power that any civilian can ever have , but 
is the worlds largest democracy  really true to its values .
we as a country might boast about our popular sovereignty (generally hampering to the nri’s) , our rich culture , tradition and custom or for a fact we could even boast about a ₹ 3000 crore statue , but can we say that our country is a democracy. 
for the past 70 years we have seen many changes in the government. new policies introduced , new reforms made ... and ultimately it would be right to say that most of them were done to improve the government and the democratic factor , but in the recent times i believe that democracy has taken a huge blow . a trend has been established where elected representatives instead of improving the democracy , they commit certain atrocious acts which are clearly  non - democratic. be it violating the constitution, non federalism , engaging communal riots , sowing seeds of discord , violating and curtailing individual rights and what not . such acts have always given a huge blow to the democracy, and the main reason behind this is the impurity in politics . instead of improving the govt , politicians tend to use democracy as a weapon , or as a power , just for their own “fair” use . is this how low democracy has fallen? incidents like curtailing rti act ,  sowing seeds of communal hatred , giving unnecessary attention to foreign affairs and building of a religious place .. and ignoring actual problems like economic crisis , unemployment, poverty , food and water shortages, women safety and what not . if a voice is raised against this impure system then in a very “ framed democratic way “  sedition charges are issued . isn’t it wrong to not raise a voice against wrong doings ? that’s what mahatma gandhi taught us right ? isn’t it right to raise awareness ? isn’t it right to think and question ? and isn’t it right to get rid of such incompetent and impure system which is ruining our democracy ? 
this is what i feel

My first day here in Delhi was certainly a whirlwind of dodging scams, cars, and delicious but delhi belly inducing street food vendors. Had a few questions to the locals and hoping you guys can help me out.

1) One thing that fucking *infuriates* me wherever I am around the world is people that cut lines. After my first day I see this everywhere at shops, the metro, atms, etc. Normally I just confront the person and they back down, but am I in the wrong to do that as a foreigner here? What tactics for queueing should I take in India to ensure that I am being treated fairly?

2) This trip I'm only here for a week (will be coming back very soon for a long term trip) and trying to buy a sim card both Vodaphone and Airtel told me it was going to cost at least 400 rupees for because they don't offer a week package. The websites online say otherwise, where should I find a cheap sim card for the week?

3) How much should things cost? Like a standard curry dish or a beer. The area I'm in  (Greater Noida) seems to have many locals but the prices are still higher than anticipated compared to other place I've been in Asia. 

4) Any other advice for me? Thanks",1573480003.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,19,28

This is a rant about this PG accommodation startup called Zolo.

TLDR - Zolostays PG promises to solve problems but sucks. Only that you have an app to look at all this nonsense and log support tickets.

So this is in chennai. Finding a PG here is difficult what with the hot weather and all that. I moved to Chennai about a year back and I got tired going around trying to find a place to stay only to be bombarded with unhygienic places that were scruffy and overcharged. Somebody tells me there is this app/company called Zolo and they have nice places, so i go check it out and it is all nice and dandy and the rooms were far better than anything else out there at that time. I get settled in. This was a year back and mind zolo here was newish back then.

And these are the list of the problems that have happened so far,

1. The housekeeping is shit. Sometimes people come in to clean, sometimes days go by without anyone showing up. It is so erratic and when asked about it the guy in charge here said ""Oh the maids are not good blah blah blah""
2. The food quality went from worse to abysmal in a span of 2 to 3 months after which I unsubscribed from the food service. They charge a good 2400 bucks per month for it. I'm talking your classic dried pooris, zombie rotis, chutneys that are bland as hell or foul, you get the picture. When asked about it I was told they changed caterers and this must be the caterer's fault.
3. The Wifi keeps dying now and then with an alarming frequency. When it works it works, when it does not it takes a long time to come back up online. Complaining to the guy in charge here is almost close to useless and if you raise a ticket, the internet comes back up online before someone even responds to your ticket.
4. Water & power problems. This has by far been the worst experience so far. All the residents had to complain and bicker for days before it got sorted out.
5. The customer support is a whole another level of incompetence. Any response usually takes a couple days or more than that. Issues that need to looked at immediately never get solved in a timely manner cos the support does not even look at your case before a day. Payment problems happen all the time in the app that they have. There is not even a customer care number where you can call and complain, they just ask you to log a ticket.

Why start a company and say it is gonna change the way PG / hostels are managed and then only go on to have the same set of problems, only worse, but now you have an app for it. I don't even.

7124,"Relationship advice with sister in law and general life wisdom for a mean girl.Hey everyone!

Well, I am here to fish for some general advice about cool headedness, ego and relationships with elders. I also seek to get some different perspective over the situation I'm going to tell. But warning first, **it's going to be long.**

This weekend, I made a much overdue phone call to my sister in law, after some 1-2 months I suppose. My husband had been getting some mini lectures from her over this call drought, and I knew there was going to be one for me too whenever I call. It was warranted too; apart from the long gap, both us idiots had forgotten to wish her Diwali which is one of our biggest festivals.

After the initial pleasantries, she was quick to mention this and I was quick to accept the lapse from our side. I gave a few useless and unnecessary points in our defense, just to keep the conversation going, not as a justification. Anyway, what's wrong was wrong and I apologized straight away once again that this shouldn't have happened. She then started mentioning my responsibilities as the bride of the house (husband is the only son) to be careful of these things, wishing birthdays & festivals, fulfilling small small wishes of elders, moulding myself into the fabric of the family, etc etc. I was instantly agreeing with all of this (it was all pretty harmless, repeated stuff which elders mostly tell us, nothing big).

I don't remember when did the switch flick (it had to); maybe I was expecting this topic to be over soon and start some other conversation while she wanted to continued with it, or she said something in this context which I disagreed with; anyway, we were soon arguing. Her primary complaint was that not wishing Diwali was a very big lapse on my part, and I let my secret out. The thing was, I deliberately didn't text her on Diwali. HEAR ME OUT. I am very punctual about wishes, be it big festivals (Diwali, Dusshera, etc), or relatively small ones (beginning of Navraatri, Ganesh Chaturthi (small for us, not in Maharashtra and other states), etc). I always take care of these things and had texted her on each of these (minor than Diwali for us) festivals on WhatsApp falling during Sept-Oct, but with NO replies from her. So beginning from Dusshera, I let it go. I didn't text her as well. I texted my other SIL (I have 2), but not her.

She had a brilliant reply for this. She said ""WhatsApp par to office wale bhi message karte hai. Waha wish karna wish karna koi na hua."" It might have been a justified reason for her (just like one's reasons are justified for them), but I wasn't having any of it. I said that this is in reply to your complaint of me not taking care of such things. I then went on mentioning various instances of me being the good SIL/DIL (collages on everyone's birthdays, collages on anniversaries, heck collages even on Women's Day, general conversations on family WhatsApp group which include harmless leg pulling, discussing varied thoughts, etc). To which she only had to say that these all are the responsibilities of being in a family, one has to act according to the traits of a family, etc etc. My only reply was when have I not done that and I was again listing these things. But she had something to say for each of the things.

Between all this, I was mentioning again and again that I accepted the Diwali mistake early in our conversation so we should not even be talking about all this. But I guess it all had to come out. She became a little impatient at one moment and her only defence, a pretty common one, was ""*Tum kuch sun kyu nahi sakti jab bade keh rahe hai? Kuch ho jayega? Bolna jaruri hai? Kuch galat bhi kehte hai bade to sunaa nahi ja sakta kya?*"" She was a little tearful at this point and frankly I was tired too. She made another common elders' comment, ""I think it was my mistake to accept anything from you. From now on, I'll be careful. Expectations hurt.""

In the next 4-5 exchanges (I seriously don't remember them), we kind of reconciled, did some other small talk, I bid her goodbye and gave the phone to my husband. He was witness to this whole conversation and knew about me purposefully not texting her Diwali wishes, so had an idea that this argument was in store. He didn't say anything to me and just asked if I felt too much bad about anything she said. When I had told him about me intentionally not texting her (a few days back), he had said, ""arey kar dena chahie tha na, dono bachh jaate. See, one shouldn't make this an ego game. She didn't text you, that's her problem. You just make sure you are in the right always so that no one has anything to say against you.""

Now, in my mind, I'm am 100% right regarding my rebuttals. But there must be something else too, right? I mean, I obviously didn't gain anything by this and neither did she. Ideal case would have been just a few quips/remarks from her side, profuse apologies from my side and then quickly dismissing the issue and discussing something else. After all, I had been a mean girl too by intentionally skipping greeting just her. I feel neither of us handled it according to our age and quarreled like 2 kitties over nothing but loss of peace of mind for a few hours (or maybe 1-2 days). This was not a fight to be won/lost. 

I could have simply 'hmmm'd to all that she had to say and pretty soon she'd be out of things to say and all would have been well. How does it matter really? One can be a bigger person and just be calm, and this wasn't a really big situation to begin with where I just had to put my foot down and show who the boss is.

So what wisdom do married, or even unmarried people have to share over this? I say unmarried, because I've seen parents, particularly mothers use such standard elders' sentences with their children in situations where no one is right or wrong. Some people might not even see any issue here, and they'll be right too. There isn't really some world-ending issue. I am just seeking some perspective and emotional knowledge that one should be equipped with when dealing with elders.

**TL;DR** - SIL argued about me (intentionally) not wishing her Diwali and I told I have otherwise always fulfilled my wishing responsibilities. We bickered and it has left me pondering over ego, stance in front of elders, my mean-girliness and general life lessons for a peaceful life.

**PS**: Relationship with her has been cordial prior to this. She's just like me in many things (middle kid of parents, really close to brother, first kid to go out of house for job, star of the family, contacted by elders for all kind of advice, very street smart (more than me), you get the point). I have called her many times after my marriage, once a month, and all calls have been >45 minutes, with her discussing all kinds of things.",1573473992.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,18,8

I enter into the class and walk towards them, greet everyone on my way, fist bump here - fist bump there, namaste here - Salam there, untill I meet my ""one friend"" who didn't notice my arrival untill I sat besides him and said hi. He greets back very relentlessly and then proceeds to do his work. After a while, he looks at me again and says ""arei tu aayaa"" and then leans forward to give me a hug, puts his hand around my shoulder and starts ranting like a lamb ""Jai Shri Ram!"" ""Jai Shri Ram!"". Now the other guy next to him, who is also a friend of mine responds back ""Jai Shri Ram!""

Ahlright, what just happened? What the actual fuck just happened?! We rarely even talk! Why was this brought up. 

They all know me to as someone who takes interest in politics. Also, I am very neutral..don't like brushing off everyone just cause I don't agree with a few of their narratives. 

I was quite happy with the verdict. I was in the salon when it happened, they had it on some Hindi news channel which went on celebrating ""RAM LALLA KI JEET"". Owaisi sparked a controversy. I haven't really read what both sides of the aisle had to say. I don't sugar coat, nor stand like an apologetic freak. I fucking speak my mind but I try my best to be diplomatic as much as I can. I hate fights, nor do I want to loose my good friends.

But this was shocking. I smiled at him and walked away. The last time when the Kashmir thing happened, it was him who looked at me, sitting in the back row and said ""Kashmir hamara hai"" 

I'll be honest my south indian friends to a large extent are very neutral and peace loving. They understand, think and form an opinion. Im not trying to be stereotypical, but I've seen this level of indoctrination  rampant amongst north Indians. This friend of mine is a son of an ex veteran, who is, I must say an amazing man. 

I don't really blame him for that. He is part of an echo chamber, like we all know roots only towards their own biases. It's a psychological game play. Facts don't really effect them. 

I just wanted to share it. This was bothering me this afternoon. I would appreciate to here your thoughts and any similar experience you had.

7147,"Question from Foreigner: Common Symbol Found Among Antique Jewelry of RajasthanDid some googling today and looking at a lot of Rajasthan amulets, I noticed a common symbol among them: a circle in the intersection of two infinity symbols: https://www.etsy.com/listing/591621047/antique-silver-amuletpendant-44-x-41-mm?gpla=1&gao=1&&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=shopping_us_a-craft_supplies_and_tools-beads_gems_and_cabochons-charms_and_pendants-pendants&utm_custom1=1489cf3c-48d6-4f6e-b84b-d47f4bd0d909&utm_content=go_1843970764_76535547104_346429178147_pla-295939758846_c__591621047&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIrd_3w-bh5QIVk6DsCh0BIQcJEAQYBSABEgKR2PD_BwE

In fact, I found a lot of examples of jewelry incorporating this symbol, collected in this Google Doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_o2z_bDhfRYkfvAIZ5r6s-bdE8MtdXdjlo25nC5zEE/edit?usp=sharing

Which makes me wonder: what significance does this symbol hold? One of the links I found describes it as a floral symbol. But if anyone knows, please inform me, I would be happy to know

(and also, to see if it is traditional and thus, public domain, because... well, I drew an amulet that coincidentally looked like that symbol.",1573463927.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,8
7148,"As an engineering student, studying in a tier-3 college should I aim for IIMs?I hope r/Indians who did MBA from an IIM or one of the top 15 B-Schools in India can clear my doubts. I am preparing for CAT 2020.

As the title says, I am studying engineering in a local private engineering college in Ghaziabad. My acads are 10th- 88.83%(ICSE), 12th-91.2%(ISC), Btech- 78%(EEE) with a pending backlog so far upto 3rd year.

Extra curriculars- winning/runner up in couple of writing events  at institute level, helped organize an event with guest lecturers from foreign universities, volunteered for social services club of my college for one semester .

Position of responsibility -Part of Editorial team of annual college magazine.

Work experience, if at all, is likely to be in an IT company.

My doubt is that since most of the  IIMs , and the recruiters in those IIMs, are actively biased against engineering students, and prefer the engineers to be from old IITs/NITs/BITS and not to mention  commerce graduates from SRCC and other top DU colleges. 

Wouldn't I be at the bottom of the deck for the admissions (and if converted by any chance),  summer or final placements, when the brand of my UG and below average extra curriculars are considered?",1573450774.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,16,15

### Tl;dr

The concoction of CCTVs and Facial Recognition continue to ring alarm bells. We recently even received a response from the NCRB to a legal notice sent to them. But in light of the continuing growing concerns of CCTVs and facial recognition technology in the recent weeks, we throw a few more kicks to fight against this trajectory of mass surveillance.

### Our worries still remain

Facial recognition softwares have created a cause for concern not only in India but across the world. Blatant issues of misindentification, discriminatory profiling and just incredibly high levels of inaccuracy have been demonstrated even by researchers in Georgetown and MIT.

Recently, in the Delhi High Court in Sadhan Haldar v. The State NCT of Delhi & Ors (W.P. (CRL) 1560/2017) before the High Court of Delhi, the Ministry of Woman and Child Development has submitted that the facial recognition software used by the Delhi Police to identify missing children is so inaccurate that not only was its match rate only 1%, it also misidentified pictures of boys with that of girls.

### Step by step attack

1. **Axe Kick: Correspond with Government bodies**  
We sent a legal notice to the NCRB with a copy to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on the illegality of the tender for Automated Facial Recognition Systems explaining the current lack of legislative safeguards to oversee such a technology and the features that create widespread cause for concern ([**Read here for more**](https://internetfreedom.in/maskon/)).  
[**Our previous post**](https://internetfreedom.in/the-ncrb-responds/) updated you on the back and forth we've had with the NCRB recently.
2. **Vertical Front Kick: Few Questions**  
As always, we're armed with all the RTI's we could possible file. So in response to one sent to the NCRB, we were given minutes of the meeting held with the bidders for the AFRS but other information requested was denied on account of the tender process still going on. According to the response, most vendors asked for an extension; specifically for a consortium to bid for the tender, certain standards required by the systems and especially whether systems should be able to identify cases of plastice surgery ([**Have a closer look at the response**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ltUSEIOo-UQMwFzvxubJejnW-7Y1JvIT/view?usp=sharing)).  
We have filed another RTI with the Airport Authority of India on the deployment of facial recognition in airports in Varanasi, Pune, Kolkata, Hyderabad and Vijaywadi for copies of tenders, bids and minutes of any meetings.
3. **Final leg sweep: Floods of Questions**  
The deployment of such facial recognition systems is largely reliant on the installation of CCTVs and is being conducted extensively in various states. Hence, we filed RTIs with the states of New Delhi, Bangalore, Jammu and Kashmir, and Maharastra.  
*Delhi:* Informed that most of the information abouf the Request for Proposal and bids submitted was available in the public domain and that no entities were empanelled for the project ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l0k0J2i2kJM9f7M2EHvu7aGTmfndvMtI/view)).  
*Maharashtra:* It provided information of the number of cameras, the period of storage and the agencies that have access to the CCTV footage ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R6I7uakmKABwcr8DToGk3tgFtaddJWKz/view?usp=sharing)).  
Concerned with how this has extended to installation of CCTV's in schools as well, on the request of a student that reached out to us, we filed an RTI with Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law in Punjab on the CCTVs on campus. The response was overwhelming with a total of 74 CCTVs and even specified a list of locations where the CCTVs are located ([**Read here for more**](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J6HVORyn_5FknlOpV72rQo29du3_sIHY)).

We are well aware of the limited public funds in place and systems that are neither accurate nor in accordance with the protection of individual fundamental protections are an incredible cost to public exchequer and the rights of an individual. While these technologies may be a comforting scarecrow, we need to be careful of its eyes in disguise.

Now here comes the tricky part. My best friend has told me that he knows thr girl and also said that he has seen her with several boys on more than one occasion. This is due to the fact that my friend lives a few houses apart from the girl. He has asked me to reconsider the proppsal and not to marry the girl. He has further shown me some photos of the girl with one boy.(not anything explicit). 

I have known my friend for the past 10 years and trust him completely, perhaps more than my family
 This is because my family actually likes the girl because she is pretty by normal standards and belongs to a well to do family. I am a virgin and  although do not want a virgin bride but at least someone who may have 2 or 3 boyfriend s in the past.

I was just curious if HT has actually started creating podcasts. As someone who has grown up reading them, it's a shock and a surprise.

7240,"A story about a temple.This happened in the late 90s in a Central Indian town.

At that point many people in my family worked for the Railways and so stayed close to and around the Railway quarters in the city. It is a fairly large colony stretching across a quarter of the city's area. 

There was a vacant plot of land in the middle of the quarters which was always used by the kids to play cricket or the.local buffaloes to chill during the day. It was at the crossroads meaning a lot of the colony's youth hung around in the evenings in the pre-cellphone era, doing what the buffaloes and the children did during the day and in between.

There was a rumour that circulated around that some local Muslim communities wanted to build a mosque in the empty plot and overnight it spread across the colony. Note that this piece of land was owned by the Railways and any private or religious construction was illegal by law. 

Note that this wasn't the RSS/BJP bastion (even today) back in the day and the Shakha was just an informal unit consisting of goons and local political wannabes (think corporators and their ilk)  who have been trying their luck in elections since a decade prior. The local shakha got a whiff of the rumour and immediately a group of young Hindu youth were mobilized into action. Most of these youth were unemployed then and had nothing else to do, late 90s.were dire days for small town boys as it is for them today, atleast in those railway quarters.

They took a stone that they found somewhere in the vicinity and overnight put in the rumoured mosque site. Know at this time that there were far fewer Muslims in the vicinity and they don't even make a significant demographic in the area. In the morning there were chants of mantras and people started spreading the rumour that the 'God' had miraculously 'sprung' there overnight. The colony's women started thronging the place and they came to a consensus that it was a Ganesha temple. Over the next year another ancillary Shiva temple was added and the hear later one for Shani, hence diversifying the portfolio.

The Railways were as usual too late to get to know about the encroachment and finally then they got to the site they had a lathi weilding gang and a huge Mahila sabha waiting for them. It was either the lathi or retreat they were told. The authorities Jai Shree Raamed and went away.

A case was filed which is still dragging along now meanwhile the temple has become a major money spinner and has creeped into the land next door and has a small function hall as well. One of the goons involved won the Corporator election the next year and slowly the colony shifted full right thanks to the temple. The money goes unaccounted and in the local mythology the temple has now existed for more than a century and it is legitimised in all the literature spread by the temple. All that happened was a piss stone was put in one corner and the whole colony believed what they wanted to believe. Now each morning as bhajans blare in the morning it serves as a constant reminded of what was and what could've been.

Events like this are not isolated and they are the intersection of ineducation, unemployment, political opportunism and simple blind faith. Wake up, rise against the loudspeakers and let reason be your voice.

7265,"The dark age of dowry hasn't left India still it seemsJust came here to rant since there isn't anything else I could do, I suppose.

I have this relative in North Karnataka who is from a very conservative Indian family and about to get married. Her ""arranged marriage"" is fixed by her parents and I was shocked to know today that the groom's side has specifically asked the following in dowry:

- 8 tolas of gold jewellery to be carried by bride.
- 2 tolas of gold separately given as gift to groom on marriage day.
- 1 tola of gold to be given to mother-in-law in ear-rings form.
- 10K worth of suit to be given as gift to groom.

I wonder about the kind of mentality of that family who asks these things, would they be having even the slightest interest in the bride herself, as a person? Tried hard to explain to her parents, asked them to outright reject this proposal as it doesn't sound good but they aren't listening to me, they are going ahead with the marriage. Advised me to stay away from these things and let the others ""handle"" it.

The bride is well-educated and has recently completed BSc but is afraid to voice anything in the parent's decision. I don't think I can interfere anywhere in this matter without getting a lot of angst in return, I just don't understand what I should do. The marriage is in February, so there is still some time.

**Edit**

For reference, 1 tola of gold costs about ₹30,000",1573402855.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,84,91
7266,"I Fucked Up Big Time: Shame on me that I harassed a girl and but thanks to her that she saved my life. And am SUPER Sorry to HER! and other people.tl,dr; Harassed a girl under spell of mental disorder, gave trauma and stress to people but they saved my life. I am going to hell for this.

I Own this SHIT. AM ASHAMED and Probably should have been jailed. But this girl and other people saved not only my life but my dignity thanks to her.

I fucked up few months of life of lots of people due to my depression. This is a throwaway account and I am hiding the real identity of the girl but revealing my initials.  I don't know if I should write the events in details and so openly but am trying to detail events.

Me: My family comes from a conservative Indian background and so I have never been so much in touch with girls from outside my family. Not every girl attracts me and I kind of maintain the decorum and limits while talking with any person. Its kind of basic courtesy and manner that my family has taught. One major issue is that I was sexually abused and bullied as a child by few people from outside family and this kind of has made me mentally sick. You can say depressed or whatever. I am coping up with it.  Now I am an adult and work in a private company. You can call me SA-LA! I deserve to be scorned and probably abused now.

Her: So I met this nice girl on a dating app. We clicked and shared few months of time chatting and caring. I kind of slowly fell for her. We talked shits about studies and bitched about life too. I kind of loved her but without any sort of sexual feelings. You can say I never sexually liked her honestly and got bonded. She maintained some gaps in the conversation and I kind of always respected.

Gaps: So there were few spells of silences in our conversations. It was all in all healthy conversation gaps.

The FUCK Up: So after few months of chatting, I kind of started keeping busy with life and drifted. We stopped the conversation and we stopped the chatting on whatsapp and all. But being busy meant I remained indoor a lot of time. I started getting deficient in lots of Vitamins and other things. It started showing on my mental health. I started getting Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Spells. I kind of started pestering the girl on her Insta and other accounts to talk. My mind always thought why isn't she responding and I tried more to talk the more she ignored. I started stalking her on many other platforms. It became a never ending loop.

The Probable Cyber Compalint and My SHITTY Days: So I kind of became Attention Deficit (ADHD). In office time I became very crappy and hardly was able to co-ordinate with my work. It became a routine and I kind of pestered her for 3 months before she probably plugged Cyber Cell people and I kind of became trapped in this endless spiral. I used to chat god-knows-what shit and these people and she tolerated my SHIT! for almost 3 months!. I used to behave abnormally and talk shits. I kind of became the victim of my own mind. It was an endless spiral, I started sending my pics and audios and behave like psychos.  It kind of fills horror in my head still now while writing it. My office colleagues started asking for me to take some break.

The Tripping Point: So while talking craps I kind of brought 'sex' in the topic and these people started asking for sexually explicit contents, through some different ids. In a major lapse of judgement under mental imbalance I shared sexual content (pics, audios, videos). Before I could gain my senses it was already late. it started another kind of guilt-trip inside my head.

After AFFECTS:  After sharing my explicit content I kind of became obsessed for knowing who the F\*\*\* asked me these content. I kind of became suicidal with horrible behavior. I started assuming that the girl has asked me the content and I started abusing her on audios. It was some real SHIT! I didn't sleep for days and my mother was scared but didn't dare to ask whats wrong. I cried, cried and just cried non-stop with spells of laughter. INSANE!

The Care They Gave: Even after all this shit they cared for me. I was constantly plugged to my phone. I collected all the evidences to keep as a proof for my mental distress and for the reason of my suicide. I neared suicide once for split seconds and gained senses just before. They coaxed me to show to doctors and after 2-3 days I got the hints though pics.

The After Super Guilt: I kind of went to the hospital after the whole saga and shown a doctor. I consulted few other people as well and am under medication. I have taken long spell of off from work for making my mind normal. But I feel super guilty. Am SUPER SORRY, I gave trauma to all the people involved  and am THANKFUL to everyone for saving my life.

Am SUPER SORRY to everyone for the Agony and Trauma I caused! Am FILLED with REMORSE.

7298,"Girlfriend being held captive by fraud for forced marriage. Help me make it viral.My girlfriend, 22 years old, is being held captive for forced marriage and suppressed of her basic human rights. Her marriage has been fixed completely against her will. She is currently being held captive by her family and exhausted of all legal options. A high-level plotting has been done against her and me so that we get no help. Neither her nor me or anybody else can do anything about it unless a high-level body takes the matter into their hands. Cops, courts, you name it, all are involved, leaving us helpless.

I am going to post this whole story on my [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Sagar.Parikh.2626) (@Sagar.Parikh.2626) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SPMBPro) (@SPMBPro) this month, so please add me there and share and/or comment if you can support me.

On 11 June 2019, my girlfriend's Roka (sort of engagement) was done by force with another man. That man and his parents knew that she is in love with somebody else and completely against this forced marriage, but just like the victim's parents and rest of the family, they said it doesn't matter. A few days before that happened, she had called National Women's Helpline number 181 to take action against her parents arranging the start of this forced marriage, but all the women cops did was come at her place in Surat (Gujarat, India) and counsel the parents. Seeing that not work, she went to a local police station a few days later to file a complaint against her family and seek help, but she was told that ""no crime has been committed yet and there's nothing we can do, this is your family matter.""

We came to realise just around this time that she was under constant watch from private detectives hired by her family, who worked to ensure she didn't flee away. The restrictions were tightened after the Roka and she hasn’t been allowed (by physical force) to leave the city (Surat) and meet anybody or speak with anybody outside of her family. However, having been in a relationship with me for almost three years, she couldn't keep herself from me and continued speaking with me.

In the meantime, my girlfriend's family created a plot to kidnap her and take her to her grandpa's place in Chennai (Tamil Nadu, India) and hold her in captivity there until the date they have fixed for her marriage (17 January 2020). They have proved her mentally ill or something that legally leads to her having no authority for her decisions. Her family seems to have obtained false medical documents proving her in no capacity of making any sensible decisions. Fearing I or my family might try to help the woman, they have even filed various fake police cases on me and my family. She told me that her family has filed charges against me such as blackmailing her with her intimate pictures, trying to make her runaway against her will, etc. She also told me that her father has hired thugs to beat us up if required. Her father has been to jail in the past for money-mattered frauds and happens to be of a very bad character. Her family took her phone away one day and used some of our private chats on phone in which we had a few arguments as an evidence to prove the cops that I am a threat to her life in various ways. One day she was locked in her room by her parents and was forced to answer various questions about the same asked by a court magistrate brought home by them. She didn’t say anything against me, though, because there was nothing to.

In August 2019, my girlfriend's mother flew to Chennai to plan with grandpa and three maternal uncles how to bring her to Chennai. Her grandpa is a millionaire and has a lot of influence among politicians, state cops and courts. He's a prominent money-lender, and from what I hear, he's got INR 20-30 crore floating easily in Chennai's money market on loan. He owns several more big businesses, and so do his three sons. He has been running her house since forever as her father doesn't make much money and cannot live up to his rich community's standards. While her father makes barely around INR 25,000 a month, her grandpa and her mother want a wedding worth INR 1 crore for her. Her dad can't afford it and wants the burden off his head. Her grandpa is funding the wedding. Nobody from her family accepts me as they are (Rajasthani-)Jain, while I am a (Gujarati-)Hindu.

For about two weeks, her mother stayed in Chennai and plotted how to bring her there with the help of her grandpa, three uncles and Surat and Chennai cops. Then her mother returned to Surat with one of the uncles and a top-level Chennai cop, who told her that ""I have come from Chennai especially to take you there, and there's no way you can stop me.""

Just 3-4 days later, on 3 September 2019, my girlfriend was abducted and taken to Chennai by her uncle and the Chennai cop. In the afternoon, her mother took her to a Jain temple saying they’re going for the prayer of the on-going Samvatsari festival’s final day and when she returned home, a squad of corrupted local cops, the Chennai cop and others were standing outside along with a bag of her clothes. She called cops using her phone and a team of cops did arrive at the scene, but the Chennai cops showed him some ""orders"" and other documents, seeing which they went away in just a minute without even taking a statement of the victim or speaking with her. She was then beaten up by her mother in front of the whole building for calling cops on her parents, even though she was just trying to save herself. Then she was forced into a car along with the corrupt local cops, her uncle and the Chennai cop and taken to the Surat Airport. The physical torture wasn't new, as her parents had already been doing that from 3-4 months by now.

My girlfriend was taken straight to the Surat Airport's runway, no entering terminal or anything. Her family had attained VIP access to the aircraft which is given to only high-profile government officials or celebrities. She was made to sit in the car until just a few minutes before the flight was to depart for the take-off.

For about three weeks, she was kept in Chennai at her grandpa's place and constantly tortured, physically and mentally, by her relatives. They kept beating her up everyday, all the time, saying ""Stop talking with your boyfriend (me). Cut all the ties with him."" She was not allowed to go outside for three weeks and kept in one room on the third floor. Sadly, even her aunts used to beat her up. Fed up and unable to tolerate anymore, she wrote a suicide note and planned to take her life one day. Before she could do so, her family members found it and beat her up a lot for the same. Her grandpa immediately called her mom-dad and paternal grandparents from Surat asking them to come there at the earliest. Her mom-dad and paternal grandparents arrived in Chennai then. The parents beat her up a lot as soon as they arrived, for planning to suicide and not stopping to love me.

On 26 September 2019, my girlfriend was relocated by her family to Bangalore (Karnataka, India), where grandpa has another house. The reason, she told me, was that her uncles have even more influence among cops and courts. She was beaten up even more brutally there everyday. Her family now keeps an eye on her every second she uses her phone and no longer lets her talk with me. Wherever she has stayed for the past six months, be it in Surat, Chennai or Bangalore, her room has been bugged with spy video and audio recorders. Even her phone is bugged; her family has read all of our private chats and known wherever we talk right at the moment.

Nobody else from the woman's family is ready to help her because most don't know, and regardless, nobody in her community helps in case of human rights matters. “Apne mein aisa hi hota hai is their common excuse.” Adults being forced into arranged marriages is very common in the Rajasthani communities. The use of physical and mental torture and thugs is common among them, is what I have learned after reading multiple cases in newspapers and court filings. However, this is a whole new level of plotting and has basically made the victim helpless. If I go to court and file a writ petition to legally force her parents to bring her to court where she can reveal her family's crimes, her family has filed a lot of fraud legal cases registered on me to prove that I am nothing but a danger to my girlfriend's life and that I am making false accusations on them. I approached several prominent lawyers to ask about filing a legal case, but everybody was of the opinion that you barely stand any chance in this case and that little can be done about it unless a really powerful government body, whether national or international, gets involved and pressurises the corrupt local cops to investigate and help this woman. They could’ve just filed a case and earned good money from me, but luckily they were genuine people.

I make a very sincere request to you to bring this case to light and help my girlfriend. Adult forced marriages with domestic violence from family among the rich and educated but orthodox communities are very common in India but those cases are mostly suppressed with money and influence. Her case being severely dramatic makes it worse. District, City and State Women's Commissions can do nothing other than counsel parents. They have no legal authority to take action. Trust me, I’ve checked all my facts and tried everything. And the situation is too delicate now to take any risks where there's not enough legal enforcement.",1573414036.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,6

7311,"My friend is a UK pakistani diaspora who wants to visit India.... Hear me out firstOk, so I know this may seem a bit controversial at first but please let me explain before I get downvoted on this. This is for my friend and he didn't want to write this as he believes that he is going to get hounded at. So that's why I am writing out this for him.

The story has been for a few years now he has been wanting to visit India (specifically mumbai, new Delhi and Amritsar before crossing the border back into Pakistan). 

He was born and brought up in UK and visits Pakistan every year to visit family and has a green card for pakistan.

He wants to visit India but because of the fact that his parents are both born in pakistan and you nees to declare (I think) where your parents came from originally, he can't go to India easily as his white counterparts from the UK would. 

Is there truly no easy way to get an Indian visa even for just one full week so that he can be able to tick one thing from his bucket list if you like. 

Can he not just simply conceal the fact that his parents are from pakistan and just apply for an Indian visa straight away like his white counterparts can from the UK and face no problem at the Indian airport? 

His dream plan, if you like, is to visit mumbai, new Delhi and Amritsar before crossing the wagah border back into Pakistan via his green card.",1573430793.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,18,22

7326,"(Serious) How do you guys get the courage to tell your parents something you know will break them?I'm 30s female living in the US. Essentially grew up here but visit every year to see family (all my cousins and grandparent). A few years ago, I met the person that I'm now engaged to, albeit secretly. At that point, she was a woman and knowing that this was my endgame, I told my parents. 

You can imagine the suicide threats, sadness, tears, priests, pujas, showing up at my work begging me to marry a man. They told me to break up with her and after just being overwhelmed by sadness and threats of suicide (mom literally has a bunch of Klonopin), I told them I broke up with her (narrator - she didn't). Honestly, I'm still scarred from that initial coming out. Even though we haven't recently had a fight, I'm always waiting for the shoe to drop...the next fight, the next ""what did I do wrong? Do you want to kill me and your father"". They've disowned me three or four times but of course, a week later, they call as if nothing happened. We speak of it every now and then when my mom or dad break down, cry and tell me to just marry a man. 

My partner is now transitioning to a man - oh if I had known earlier and just fucking waited. If he had known earlier. Alas. That isn't so. He's keeping his name because it really doesn't sound feminine or masculine...the issue is that in my fucking ""moment of truth"", my moment of ""I will now be truthful to my parents because they are my parents"", I told them her name, it was and still is, years ago during that initial coming out. 

I'm going to have to break it to them. He doesn't fully pass a male for everyone yet and personally, I don't care but I know they will. I want to tell my cousins. I miss them and would love to know that I have a family behind me. I know r/india leans more liberal to begin with but knowing the people you do in your lives, how do you think they would take it?

7344,"Is this a realistic idea and can this be implemented?So the government run Indian school system, which includes CBSE as well as state board curriculum is quite bad. 

The syllabus of CBSE as well as state boards is set by the government. If my understanding is correct, I believe that the ncert (which is under the central government) mainly sets the syllabus?

Then you have CISCE which is a private board that was formed in 1958 and based on cambridge assessment board(now called CIE/CAIE/OCR) that at the time conducted (and still does)examinations under the national curriculum of England. 

British curriculum has since then improved significantly but CISCE is I feel, stuck in the past and outdated.

There are also private schools that teach the IB curriculum, a few teach British curriculum (GCSEs+A levels etc) and extremely fewer teach American curriculums. These schools often charge ridiculous amounts.

I have personally experienced CBSE, CISCE, British curriculum/national curriculum of England as well as the International Baccalaureate(IB) curriculum. 

If I had to rank all these curriculums from worse to best, then I would rank CBSE as the worse, CISCE as slightly better(but still quite bad) and then British curriculum which was very good, but the best I think was definitely the IB.  

I have no experience with state curriculums but I would expect them to be worse than even CBSE.

So my question is: Can the curriculum of good state and central government run school be replaced with the IB programme? 

Apart from a few government schools that are located mainly in Delhi and Kerala, centrally administered schools like kendriya vidyalayas, Jawahar navodyas etc too are usually not that bad in terms of infrastructure, teachers and other resources. 

I think that the Indian government cannot be trusted to create a good curriculum, so why not just implement an already existing curriculum that is extremely good?

The IB programme is run by the International Baccalaureate Organisation, which is an old non-profit organization based in Switzerland.

It has already been implemented in many state run schools in countries like Canada and Ecuador etc and of course in tonnes of private schools across the world.

I have done some research on this and found that the affiliation fees that a school has to pay to register with the IB comes out to be almost equivalent to what CBSE charges. 

The only real differences are that teachers will have to be better trained, you need at least average infrastructure with at least a medium sized ground(so maybe slightly more area might be required but I think most such schools will be able to fulfill these requirements), but the most significant difference is the registration fees that will have to be paid to register a student for 9th and 10th grade examinations (IB middle years exams) that comes out to be about 32,000 INR as well as the registration fees for 11th and 12th grade exams(IB diploma exams), which is about 60,000 INR.

The government would have to spend slightly more on school education but the curriculum would be excellent and the student would be come out to be a lot more competent than the current lot of school leavers. 

Not only this, but I think they would also be a lot more empathetic and have a better moral compass due to the nature of the programme.

Also, Kejriwal is already providing good training to government school teachers in Delhi. If he can do it then so can others.",1573396801.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,23

Frankly, from the excerpts that I could find about the article from (mostly right-wing) sites, I don't see how any normal, religiously spiritual Hindu could find anything offensive in the moral and religious questions raised by the author (a Hindu too).

Namely:

> In the article, the author asked the questions, ***“Can God reside in a temple built by force, violence and bloodshed?*** *Can prayers be ever addressed in such a temple even if God does decide to reside there?”* Sujata Anandan also said, *“First, as a devout Hindu – and I am sorry to sound so orthodox –* ***I would want a pure site to build any temple I would pray in. Not one that was previously occupied by a mosque, though I have nothing against mosques and Muslims.”***

> Then, Anandan stated, *“Second, when the Babri Masjid was indeed demolished, I got a bee in my bonnet thinking no God could reside in a place resonating with the screams of innocents killed over the dispute and, moreover, with* ***the purity of the temple violated by the blood spilled during the conflict.”***

> *“Thirdly”*, argued the author, *“even if my gods let me down and do come to reside there, would they be able to hear my prayers over and above those screams that I am sure are still resonating round the disputed site and could get trapped within the walls of the temple?* ***I would feel worse than those who build their homes on the ashes of other people’s hopes and aspirations. With that sort of feeling, my prayers would be neither genuine nor answered, I was and still am sure. That is my faith and belief, which has no basis in legal premises or personal ideologies.”***

I guess the religious right just doesn't wish to accept the reality that the ""glorious"" temple that they are about to build has its foundation on the blood of thousands of innocent Hindus and muslims ... just as the mosque they destroyed was purportedly built on a razed temple, and the death of many innocents. How different does that make them to the muslims who did so, and they despise?",1573417560.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,6,3

7405,"How to encourage more Indians to go childfree ?Hi, I decided to go childfree after witnessing the mindless pollution created around me during the recent festive season of Diwali. I love the energy and cuteness in children and like most people, had grown up wanting to raise a small and beautiful family for myself-- but now have come to the conclusion that my time is better spent by professionally working towards curbing pollution and mentoring kids in my local neighbourhood. I also feel that more Indians will be encouraged to go childfree if there is more awareness and social embracement. I do not have a clear idea on how to go about creating this awareness, and seriously welcome your suggestions.

7409,"I faint when i see, hear or read about epilepsy, schizophrenia or any other such disease.I've a strange condition where if i see someone falling sick in real life or movies or even read  about it i feel dizzy.
It's not triggered by general illness, it's only for things like epilepsy, schizophrenia, heart attack, etc. Even the mention of such words makes me feel weird. I can fee strange by just typing this post.

What exactly happens: I feel semi conscious, I start feeling out of control, sometimes my body shakes too. 

If i keep talking to someone through this then i manage to come out normal but otherwise i faint. I also sweat a lot when this happens and once it's done and I'm back to normal my head feels cool inside.

It also helps if i can hug someone against my chest, or if someone rubs my palms or if i can suck on some candy. All of that helps me to stay in my senses and feel relaxed. 

Other observations: Although i just feel weird through those terms, the real 'attack' is more likely to happen when I've not eaten in some time or when I'm eating at that moment. At such occasions if those words come up, for some reason it becomes very difficult for me to stay in control and I almost always faint. 
I also think that this has something to do with my screen time. The more phone/laptop I use, the more difficult it gets to control if these words come up.

Specific instances:
Last week in a bus someone just freezed, prolly had a fit or something idk and just by seeing that i fainted. 

2 years back when i was back from a really hard work day, i was in my bed at my phone.

3 years back while having lunch i was talking to friends about another friend who had a fit or something and I fainted. 

Also, this has more to do with mental diseases that the physical ones. Like measles, or cold and cough just make me feel nothing. Even heart attack is also not a big problem.
But epi.. panic.. fit.. etc are really tough to handle and are a total trigger. To be honest i start worrying that something in my body will glitch and I'll start shaking, as if a bug caused me to crash.

Final ask:
This is increasing day by day. More and more words are getting into my blacklist and even watching content online or being part of a normal conversation gets very difficult if even one of the blacklist words come up.

I want to know:

7420,"Bala movie: A mix of new and the old (Analysis)I was expecting nothing from the movie Bala because of majorly 2 things. First, I had checked twitter and found people with negative reviews (well Twitter is negative about everything these days) and secondly I had to walk out of the movie ""Dreamgirl"". I like Ayushmann but I found ""Dreamgirl"" pretty average and the movie felt like a culmination of comedy circus scenes. Thus, I was sceptical.

I was totally wrong. Bala is an Ayushmann khurana trademark movie. Ofcourse the director Amar Kaushik and the entire cast are responsible for the success. But, this movie is not merely about a good script selection. Ayushmann did a marvelous job of a frustrated insecured bald guy. I could relate to his frustration. The portrayal is just too realistic. 

Now, directly coming to the themes the movie touches. (Contains Spoilers)

1. Insecurities - The movie uses Baldness (primarily) and dark complexion as insecurities people have and how the world is hell-bent on shaming them. It sees Baldness and skin tone in a completely different way. Baldness touching the masculine charm and skin colour determining the feminine side. It explores these two ideas. 

Another insecurity it explores is the millennials quest for an enhanced pseudo identity on social media platforms. Bala gets upset about his baldness because he thinks he is not presentable on Instagram and Tiktok. The material socialisation of social media where we long to get likes in our videos, intellectual brainstorming statuses and etc. Yami Gautam's character comes in the frame here as she is a viral star with modeling aspirations.

2. Status quo - Javed Jaffrey remarks in the movie, that looks don't matter for men as it is a patriarchal society and after marriage the girl has to stay with the husband irrespective of her choice cause she is now tied. In the marriage it constantly challenges this notion. Bhumi Pednekar who is herself a lawyer, encourages a women to leave ger husband who was justifying her husband's cheating because of her weight. Yami Gautam files a divorce suit after she finds Bala is bald and has lied to her about his hair. It tries to break away from the marital trap of a women. 

3. Religion - Bollywood has attempted to touch religion in films like PK, OMG! Bala's addressing of religion is inclusive. Initially it criticises Lord Krishna for beautifing a dark toned into a fair skinned girl. In the end it analyses the situation in a completely different way. Krishna was not trying to change her into fair skin, the Lord was trying to make her realise that she is beautiful. This positive interpretation and understanding of India's religious practices is commendable because many a times we associate reformation with total denunciation of religion. India's secularism has always been about plurality and not about separation of church (here religion) from the state.

4. Pop culture

It touches upon the pop culture that shames dark skinned women by mocking certain Bollywood songs. It doesn't resort to any blame game because during that time subtle misogyny was evident everywhere rather it tries to remind us how subconsciously how we have been indoctrinated with the thought that beauty means fair.

5. Staying true to yourself

Both the women lead are true to their archetype. Bhumi although felt upset as a kid when she was shamed for being dark, she doesn't let it affect her way of life. She finds social media irrelevant to project a different self and tries to live her life with her ideals. Yami on the other hand is a product of social media. She is aware of her ""beauty"" appeal and uses that to build a brand around tiktok (just like a modern day influencer). She herself admits that ""externalities"" is her way of life and without that she is nothing. That bedroom scene with Ayushmann was much needed because there's a nerd culture being developed which shames people too much. ( So, what if someone uploads a selfie or a Tiktok video? Can we just mind our won business if we don't like it. If one is self aware of their potential and knows the market, exploiting it through social media is not a sin.) It is still better than the hypocrite Ayushmann who tries to fake it. Yami is not faking it. She is aware of her ""externality"" aspect. 

6. Activism: The best cinematic aspect of Bala is that the movie is not preachy. It is subtle in its activism. It doesn't call any names to direct blame, it highlights the normalisation of practices. Like fairness obsession, body shaming and even new ones like social media's edited reality. It depicts the shallowness of being too filmy. Bala's need for gratification comes from the fact he wants to emulate Bollywood behaviour. 

7. High school nostalgia: Bala tried so hard to have his hair back is because of the appreciation he received in school. A lot of people are stuck in their school days because they had a particular identity in school. Some were good at sports but later ended up in a deadbeat job and in the case of Bala, it being the popular kid in class. People are obsessed with the highschool nostalgia as they want to go back to those days to escape the monotony that employment and real life offers.

The most important point: Is Bala a traditional Bollywood hero? Well, Bala has certain flaws. He is bald which the B'town hero rarely is. He is insecured. Our heroes maybe big time fraud in their films but they are never insecured. Bala is different to a Bollywood hero. Bala doesn't get the girl. He gets rejected by Bhumi as she is in love with someone else. Also, it doesn't follow the Bollywood style of falling in love with the second girl (read rebound) in movies such as Kuch Kuch Hota Hain. Yammi ends up divorcing Bala.

But, but it follows the conventional hero arc in the end. Because the movie is all about Bala's victory over his insecurities. It is about his catharcis which he has in his last ""fairness"" cream presentation. It is about his reversal of fortune from being an average comedian to a well loved one. He follows the athenian ideal hero in a way. (Except he doesn't visit the underground) Bhumi feels sympathetic towards Bala and fights his case (it initially felt like she loves him but benefit of doubt she was fighting for herself as well as she might relate to Bala's baldness in a way as she has suffered societical taunting for her skin tonned)

Bala might have deviated from mainstream Bollywood norms (althout it is itself a commercial movie) but it adheres to the policy of The Indian Hero resurgence.

To conclude, all this analysis holds no value if the movie is boring and Bala is far from that. It is a fun watch.",1573371354.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,15

I used to do such multiple Rs.10 topup recharge from various Wallets (like Paytm, Freecharge, Phonepay, Amazon Pay etc.) and got 100% Cashback (i.e Rs.10) on each of these recharges.

7428,"[help] What should my mother do?Ok so today the aunties of our society decided to have a 'meeting' and they decided that 'to curb the rising monopoly of housemaid they will ""unite"" and thus will fix ""fair"" rates for the housemaids'. What this basically means is that these people have decided to fix the amount of money they will play to the housemaids and everyone has to comply. The thing is, these aunties want to pay only ₹800 per month to the housemaid to clean a 3bhk house, with only 2 days holiday, and have said to not hire if these demands are not met.

Naturally this is exploitation and the housemaids will not agree. My mother is ready to pay the housemaid the money which the housemaid is demanding (₹1000) but will have to forcefully fire the housemaid if the housemaid is not agreeing to the aunties' demands( which she isn't).

So what can my mother do in this situation? She clearly thinks that the demands are exploitative, and these aunties are being bitches here. She doesn't want to fire the housemaid and is ready to pay what the housemaid is demanding. It is our first time living in a big society so we don't know how to handle situations like these.

Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

P.S. These aunties here use iPhones without cover, and are rich, but are bitching about ₹200.

I went to the doctor thinking I might get some viral infection or dengue but only wanted to general check-up.  Since it is a general consultation, the doc asked general questions like what did you eat, drink, since when, and prescribed me with a bunch of pills. The pharmacist asked me the symptoms because of repeating paracetamol pills in the prescription and told I him my symptoms(coughing and tired now but it was terrible and explaining how hot it was inside but not outside). Immediately, he responded saying “yes, it is the pollution that making people sick and what did that doctor say” I refused to tell him that doc has prescribed meds for viral infection without any test taken. 

After some awkward silence he started complaining about the air pollution again that so many people are suffering for the past one week and it’s increasing. Apparently, most of my friends and relatives are also suffering.

2. If true, How much does it affect our health/breathing pattern?

7592,"So.. what do you do when you see a child worker?In short:
Are children who sell things in tourist destinations doing child labour?
And more importantly can anyone here tell me what to do when I see these child beggars/sellers out in the 
streets if I want to help them improve their condition?








So I just went to a school tour to Mysore. There I saw a child beggar. So I decided to give her money.
My friend said that it isn't good to give money because the money they earned will be given to their masters which just creates more corruption.
He seemed to have a point so I decided to only give food to the next child beggar I meet.

Now another child came to me trying to sell me one of those long pens. I decided to not buy it. But then I had a doubt. Literally right next to me was a police officer. Why wasn't the police doing anything about something that is illegal (child labour)?

The answer my friend gave me was that it wasn't child labour. Apparently child labour is only illegal when the child has no choice in the matter. That is someone has forcing him/her to work to be considered 'child labour'

But I find that too shallow. It's not like they have a choice. Their parents are probably sick. The people who are making the children work probably mistreat them. 

Can anyone here clarify whether the child selling pens were doing child labour or not?
And more importantly can anyone here tell me what to do when I see these child beggars/sellers out in the streets?",1573365777.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,29

As per our plan, we will visit Shimla and roam around there for some time and then we will go to Narkanda and our plan was to trek and reach Hatu peak. 

We got a bit late but reached Narkanda after exploring Shimla. We were trekking towards Hatu peak still had daylight. After some time we reached a point where we saw a small shop selling tea and Maggi (It was half the way or maybe more than that). 

We thought of taking a break got Maggi from the shop. Suddenly my friend realised we forgot to get matchbox in case we need it as it was getting cold and the sun was going down also we had planned for a bonfire but now we are in the middle of a jungle with just 1 shop which was about to get shut. 

Next thing we did was to ask the shop owner for matchbox he said No. We were worried then he came and gave us the only matchbox he had as they were using wood to cook Maggi. My friend asked him how much? 

And I still remember that selfless and innocent face he replied **Koi baat Nahi Bhai Ji Rkhlo aap Apko zrurt Pdd skte hai.** I had seen such warm and helping people after so long and this made me feel India has got a lot more  to offer than we think.",1573387828.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,49,142

When I wanted a temple for Ram in place of Masjid just because Hindus are in majority.

When I voted for a fascist just for the sake of 2 meals a day(still pending)

When I corrected my  friend that a democracy has three pillars.

When 13 children died in a  road accident and Yogi scolded the protesters over creating scene (why my blood did not burst my veins that day)

When I elected a prime minister just because I hated liberals (just to satisfy my ego he has taken the country to a place where I see only a dark tunnel).

When I loathed Aatish Taseer  just because he showed us true  picture of Modi in that article.

There are a lot of questions which I need to answer to myself over a life time. 

This government has got three agendas

1. To form government  without bothering about  the precedent being  set in Indian democracy.
2. To be so vindictive to an extent that the mirror stops showing you your true face in fear of being broken (context Aatish Taseer and Tavleen singh(supporter of BJP for ages))
3. To divert attention from real issues (I think a Pulwama is going to happen in 2024 just because Pakistan wants BJP to be in the government.(Pakistan way to counter India : do terrorist attack before elections, wait for Modi to do something like Balakot and win election,  and watch India burn for the next 5 years).",1573356141.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,13,0
7609,"[Offmychest] I cheated on my wife because of my insecurity.This topic has always bothered me and no one except me knows about this. I'm not looking for any sympathy nor any advice but I have to get this out of my mind and write it somewhere. I have recently visited the depression reddit forum and it feels like I'm in a very bad place(I read couple of posts there). I just want to write all my bad memories and get them out so that it provides me closure.

Although I was raised in a semi - liberal environment, I still considered the act of sex as something special. I know that a lot of people do not think like that and I don't judge them. They perceive it as a normal activity. I won't act as a puritan who tries to moral police others but I have my own reservations and I live according to them.

I had an arranged marriage where we had a courtship period of almost a year.  We began to warm up and we both liked each other. After 6 months or so, I told her that I had relationships in the past but there was nothing physical in them. She said that she has never been in a relationship and without a doubt, I believed her. 

Things were looking good even in the beginning of our marriage but after a year of marriage, I somehow found out that she was in 2 'casual sex' relationship. I rubbished the claims but when I confronted her, she did agree to doing that. I was heartbroken at first, not for the fact that she was in a physical relationship but it was just a physical relationship. I'm not comfortable with the idea of casual sex. Before I met my wife, I ran away from a woman when she wanted to indulge in casual sex with me. I think in the heat of the moment, I got scared and chickened out. My wife told me that she was in a bad place at that time and she had sex because she wanted someone to care for her and those guys didn't love her. They just used her. It didn't feel anything at that time and I reassured her that I will always be with her no matter what happens.

I do feel sorry for her. She was used by people who never cared for her. It didn't change my outlook towards her in day to day life but it hurt me that she would lie to me about this while I was honest with her. I also had insecurity during that time. Believe me, I loved her that time and I still love her. I would like to spend the rest of my life with her but it was a dark time after the revelation. 

During sex, I burst out in tears because I imagined her with those 2 men. A lot of times, I just pushed her away after I had an orgasm. Sex with her didn't feel anything special and a lot of time, I just ignored her. 

I knew that in order to have a healthy relationship, we needed to talk and I told her all about my insecurities and why it just felt dirty to me. I know it sounds wrong but these are the exact words I used because I wanted her to know about my feelings. We agreed that both of us needed to go to therapy but the therapy just made me more frustrated. The therapist just told me accept it which isn't a bad advice, but her tone was quite condescending. 

The discussions became accusatory. I repeatedly asked her just ""why""? Why did she go back to one those guys after he kicked her out? Why did she let him use her repeatedly? Her response was first emotional needs but after he kicked her out, it was just physical needs so that she could feel better. 
I hated her at that time and I told this to her face. I called her names and then cried by going to another room. We fought everyday on this topic.

I still can't wrap my head around casual sex. Maybe I was too sheltered to begin with.
In the heat of the moment, I cheated on her with a colleague of mine. Calling it just a physical relationship would be an understatement as I did take a liking to her. It just felt like a breath of fresh air from the drama that surrounded my life every night when I returned home. On one hand, I was trying to fix my relationship with my wife but on the other hand, I was cheating on her. The guilt was just too much for me to bear after a while. I did end the relationship with my colleague after a while after she changed the company. 
The colleague I cheated with tried to make me understand about casual sex. She wasn't interested in it but she was well aware that it's common. She knew the situation at my home and knew that her relationship with me would never last long. 

Slowly, me and my wife tried to fix the relationship and it somehow worked. I wouldn't say that I trust her 100% nor I'm over it completely. We have sex around 5-6 times in a month(we're in our early 30s) but sometimes the image of her with those men flashes in my mind during sex and I don't try to pleasure her as I just want to get it done as quickly as possible. I have come a long way but a part of me still remains who wants to again ask her ""why""? Just why? 

The woman I cheated on her with did help me to get over my insecurity. I am fully aware that adultery is wrong but in this case, atleast I was able to grow a spine. It's been 5 years and we feel like our relationship has become stronger since then. 

If my wife ever finds about the affair, I will provide her a honest explanation and if she wants to proceed with divorce, I'll be fine with it. If it wasn't for the affair, I don't think our marriage would have survived another year as I had no one else to talk to who could understand my dilemma. 

As I said in the beginning, I don't need anyone's advice or sympathy. I know a lot of people would shame me or curse me which is fine by me. I just wanted to vent it out as it was suffocating for me. I felt like this might be a suitable reddit forum to post this as a lot of people here are from India and would understand that we live in a conservative society with a veil of liberalism on it. Some things are even confusing for us.

I am looking for books which touch down on the topics -- ***India before the dawn of the vedic period till the emergency period during Indira Gandhi's rule, and important historical events in between that time period***. There are a couple of books mentioned in the booklist section of r/history, but they only touch down on the early historical aspect of India till 13th Century AD (Romila Thapar and Upinder Singh have written on the topics which explore Indian history from vedic era till the medieval period.). Also, there's no book mentioned in the wiki section of r/AskHistorians. There's a dearth of book about topics like: The Mughal empire, East India Company, Sepoy Mutiny, India during WWII and India's role in it, Partition of India, Formation of Indian states, Indian-Sino war, India-Pakistan war and the freedom of Bangladesh, India during Nehru and Indira's regime, Emergency period in India. With the exceptions of books by John Keay and Ramachandra Guha, I know of no other author who has written about India from the origins to the formation of Indian states and more.

PS: I'd like the responses in this thread or the thread itself (provided it has a lot of suggestions) to be added to the archive section of  the wiki ([https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/index](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/index))  just as how there's a list of Indian podcasts, etc., so that the information remains available to all the redditors of this subreddit and to others interested in Indian history.",1573316022.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,7,1

Story time:
I have a tenant at one of my industrial site who operates a printing press for cardboard printing and packing boxes. I have leased his co. the basement and ground floor and i do my own automotive spare part manufacturing at 1st and 2nd floor. A DPCC inspector came to the site and sealed the basement siting lack of pollution certificate. My tenant kept on insisting that he has applied for it and it is under process. Meanwhile, the guy inspected my workshop as well and was deliberately looking for reasons to seal off the entire building. All this happened within 30 minutes. The only reason the officer entered the building and shun it down was because he knew that he has applied for it and is under process of his department. Best circumstances for the officer and team for their “upar ki kamai” . 
It would have been better had he not applied for it. My tenant is straightforward a very genuine guy. He invested 80 lakhs for the machines. Just imagine, not buying a property and instead investing your life savings in a venture which employs around 40 people directly and next minute your entire life is in the mercy of one corrupt officer. 
All these pollution certificates are never cleared without paying bribe to them. And if you apply for it, you pay another bribe which runs easily into lakhs, to get the seal removed. 
No wonder , why everyone wants to get a govt. job.

Awesome movie, btw. Loved it more than The Shining. (Stephen King feels the same way, so Kubrick stans should rest it.) Mike Flanagan is the best horror director right now, imho. 

There are instances where 'son of a bitch' and 'bitch' are muted and redacted.  There are a couple of scenes with full-frontal nudity of a woman which are zoomed-in for censorship so that only her face is visible in horrible pixelated stills. This is like getting mollycoddled as a grown up. I still don't know WHY these *sons of bitches* censor films with Adult certificates. What's even the point of giving them adult certificates when you surgically alter the movie to be PG-13? This is an insult to the artists and a criminal abuse of power, nothing more.

He preferred ordering from Flipkart or Amazon but I recommended him to order from their official site as the prices were less compared to what was put up on Amazon and Flipkart at that time,and now I regret this.He ordered the earphones on 18th Oct and the order was expected to arrive by 24th or 25th Oct. When it did not arrive even past the expected date we contacted JBL customer service who told to us to contact the courier service which happened to be delhivery. We both repeatedly tried calling delhivery customer service but most of the time the response was that this number is not currently registered. Sometimes the call actually went through only to be answered by the teller machine which kept on repeating ""all our customer representative are busy at the moment please hold the line or call back later"". This kept happening over and over every time we called. We might have literally called them about 50 times or so and were even patient enough to wait for half an hour hoping that someone would answer. Miraculously 2 weeks back one of their representatives answered the phone and when provided the details she informed that the consignment would be delivered within 2 days and hung up. Fast forwarding to today, my friend received a message saying that the package has been successfully delivered which clearly did not happen. Fed up with all this crap he has decided to get a refund which surely will take even more time.Seeing him go through this mess makes me feel a little guilty as I was the one who suggested the idea in the first place.

7666,"Babar was an important Indian. Whatever happens is sad but this doesn't destroy his legacy.Helllo r/india 

Note: This is a historic rant. I don't know how to tag my post as a rant. Can anyone tell me how to tag it as one?

I am a student of History and whatever has happened in 1992 shucks hard ash.

1. Should Babar be considered an outsider just because he was born outside? He had the right of Conquest. Same as the Ottomans had the right of conquest over Constantinople. 
2. Mughals coming into India was not a Muslim invasion. The rulers before the Mughals were Muslims as well.
3. The Mughal dynasty stayed here. They didn't sack the country. It was their own country.
4. Mughals shaped the culture of our country to make it diverse. Just imagine from the food perspective. Even a tiny thing like a samosa is brought by the Mughals through Persians. Don't even have to mention the art, architecture and music.
5. The VHS can't destroy the legacy Mughals have given us. If they want to wipe out something, they should start from Amit Shah's last name. That name clearly isn't from here.
6. Mehmet II repurposed the Hagia Sophia in Constantinople to turn it into a Mosque. Ataturk converted it into a museum to show the people that the area of conquests is over and the Turkish people now live in a different country. Away from conquests and all that shit. Why did we get leaders like Rajiv Gandhi, Advani and Mahajan instead of getting a good leader like Ataturk Kemal Pasha.
7. History will live on. Whatever these people will build on the land of Babri Masjid will not go down as a holy mandir but it will go down in a history as a place which was used by a religious maniac to cause thousands of deaths.

There is a lie being spread these days that says there was no Indian identity before the British took over which is bullshit. Indian identity existed way before the British came in. It was the India that Europeans came looking for after fall of Constantinople. Mughals gave India it's strong Indian flavor that makes it what it is today. The history of Babar and his descendants will always remain in this country.",1573330500.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,10,0

7713,"I am not a Hindu and I will never be.I am not a Hindu.

That is all I have to say now, the only form of dissent available to me.  I am too small to rally against a government that has power over the public discourse, the tools and purveyors of justice and the very people itself. The government has taken over what I eat, what I see and what I read. It has also slowly taken away what I believe or at least what I used to believe in. The pride with which the mass thumps its chest as majoritarian while also contributing to a dictatorial view of the government that was elected is bothersome. It shows me that what is on paper is not in the minds of people, the rot has now reached a far deeper. There is no more intelligentsia that looks at problems objectively, the best minds converted to conformity or chased away.

What is the pride in defending a country whose economy is about to falter? What is the pride in identifying with a mass? Why is there celebration over a perceived national and religious unity whereas basic necessities are not available to large swathes of the population and the country is built on a tattering education system that only reproduces but does not think? The colour of faith and national pride stops us from seeing the problems that plague us elsewhere, trying to pretend that our problems do not exist or trying to save face before the rest of the world is not a magic pill. The country was built on shaky foundations of poverty and misinformation, the political forces that followed have reaped merry on these resources. This could also be termed as a post-colonial hunt for identity and there is enough theory written, the practice is based on emotion and fear. No amount of sense can be breathed upon a person subsumed by thought control.

Seeing the temple being built reaffirms that there is no longer a future in this country. All for what? A mythical character in a story who would not have cared if one worshipped him or not. Where the biggest issues is of an outside enemy the bigger problems that plague the country go unanswered. Since most of the population does not have a conception of what the Western idea of development is (thanks to shoddy education amongst other things) they are happy to accept what they get at face value. Today it is a mandir, tomorrow it is a pogrom. Who is to care? After all they are the majority and they feel powerful. This will not end here. Kashmir was the soup and this is the starter. It will not end before the Hindutva agenda is firmly pressed down our throats. The new generation will be an anal, flag flying and name chanting drones like the Turkish or Chinese goons that are also baying for blood. The ideals that shaped this country have been distorted and I have no longer have any hope for democracy or inclusion.

I am not siding with this anymore. When the day comes when we hang our heads in shame I will not shrug and repent. Because I am not a part of this madness. The best I can do it to renounce all my affiliation with this ideology from now on. Mark my words for it will Kashi and Mathura next. And who knows what rhyming, emotionally upbeat rally call will be next. I will be called a troll, a Pakistani or shown examples of Israelis or the Muslims. My counter will be, two wrongs will not make a right and I will first try to resolve the problems of my house before embarking on a global change mission. So far I am failing though I hope not for long.

WHY?

1.6LPM is such a low salary. You can't afford a house in that. It is literally what those lower middle class people earn who drive Maruti 800 or Activas ( if they are saving money) and go to malls every month. This type of earning is for those who save money by recycling shit like plastic bags. Basically your average low middle class uncle family wali income.

And you can only raise 1 kid with this salary and that kid also will have to see through poverty while growing up. 

Now let me back what I say with some logical info. The price of house,grocery, kids and food is increasing. Probably 20-30 years back 1.6lpm could be considered as average middle class but now it is just lower middle class. 

Average McD meal costs around 200-300. You would easily need a solid 15k per month just for food. Subtracting the EMI and all from home and car, I bet you won't even have 1-5k as saving. That is disgusting for Indian family when your monthly savings should at least be 40-50k .

I don't hold that against them. I've been suffering from male pattern baldness since I was 16. My recession initially was aggressive and there was little I did to arrest the deterioration. My parents are averse to medication for hairloss. It's hereditary.


 I've lost my hairline and my hair now resemble that of an elderly Indian man. I was embarassed of this situation and hence starting wearing caps to veil my balding. I'm insecure about it and it's perceptible. My friends often mock me. The recent spate of films on balding has exacerbated my situation. I'm told that I'll die loveless because hardly anyone would want to be with me. My situation is similar to that of Bala's. I was a debonair young man with lush hair.

 Now I'm submissive, bashful. I'm censured by my family for being thin-skinned. But balding undoubtedly dents one's self esteem. Especially when it occurs at this age. I can't remedy my balding. How do I cope with it and a lovelorn future.

7808,"Trust yourself and do what you love - it works out, eventually. My story.Hello everyone, I am an average Indian born in a middle-class family was introvert from school days never talked to girls in my class in school. Anyhow I passed my 10th class now I had 2 options to opt for either got for medical or non-medical my mother wanted me to go for medical and become a doctor but I thought I am good in mathematics and physics so I opted medical and then **I had to prepare for the famous IIT-JEE exam**

till 10th I thought of myself an above-average student but now I enrolled in FIITJEE and people around me are hell smart they solved math problems before I noted them down on paper. I was struggling.

I started feeling like a loser. I tried but I had never studied for long hours before I lacked concentration and many more things which were never taught at my school so I found it very hard.

**Fast forward to JEE results I couldn't get into IIT**. I got into an average GOVT. engineering college by this time I had lost my confidence I stopped taking interest in college just passed the exams. Faculty was also below average. I had no idea what I am going to do next I thought I may get placement in an average company. But I failed in an exam in my 6th semester and was not allowed to sit for placement interviews It was very depressing for me. I was not sure what next but I consoled myself that I will go for Offcampus placements.

​

**Turning Point**

I was very depressed, worried, underconfident full of self-doubt. Then I came to know about **Vipassana meditation. 10** days of free meditation retreat I joined I had exams coming up but I left for 10 days of silence.

When I came back my mind got clear and focused. I realised I never wanted to do a 9-5 job I just want to do it for money. I kept questioning myself and came to the conclusion that I won't apply for any job.

I learnt the basics of SEO I started freelancing on Fiverr and then I learnt to programme and started building apps for clients. I rented an office after college worked for foreign clients which I do now also. I feel satisfied(Not a looser) and earn way more than 9-5 jobs.",1573325623.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,14,31
7809,"First ""date"" with an Indian guy. And last.Hello,

TL;DR: Went on a ""date"" with an Indian guy. Tries all sorts of tricks to get me to sleep with him. When rejected, proceeds to harass me with calls and emails. When ignored, he stalks me and my whole family and threatens to tell them.

Longtime redditor Throwaway for obvious reasons. Ill try to keep this short of stick to just the relevant details.

Backstory: I (28f) living and studying in Europe for almost 6 years now. My parents are indian though I've never really lived in India. I don't have much dating experience and Ive never been in a relationship either, my parents are very traditional and conservative. So I decided to try to get into the dating scene here since I'm pretty shy around guys and my parents are itching to get me into an arranged marriage.

So last week around Halloween, I matched with an Indian guy on a dating app (starts with a B, rhymes with mumble). He had an appealing profile, travelled loads, smart and educated. Ticked all the right boxes. Seemed like we would click. We chatted on the app for a bit and this was a gist of our conversation.

He asked me what I was looking for, and I said,

""*Well, a friend suggested this app since there aren't so many guys looking to just hookup. Don't mind meeting new people and if we click something more serious."".*

And I asked him what he was looking for, and his reply was,

*""Something causal since I'm only here for another two days."".*

So I said, *""Fair enough. I appreciate honesty.""* And I added, *""Well, if you've not seen the city yet and would like to see some interesting sites, let me know."".*

And so he asked if I would be his tour guide and show him around the city and that he's booked two free walking tours and if I could have a look and choose which one is the better one. By this time, we've exchanged numbers and moved over to WhatsApp now. I assumed he'd send the the tour details over WhatsApp but he then asks for my email since its *""easier""*. Gave him my email and we decide on the one tour. Its a 2.5 hour walking tour that starts at 10.30am and we fix a meeting point and time. I also ask him if he's bringing his camera cause I'd bring mine, since he mentioned it in his profile and I too like to take photos and I never turn down a photo-op. And he said he wouldn't because his phone camera would suffice. So I decided I didn't want to lug around my camera and I'd make do with mine too if I need to take any photos. I also told him I'm only free during the day since Ive got plans in the evening.

The same night, he texts me asking if I want to come over to his side of the city before we meet at 10.30am to see what he's been upto (he was visiting my city for a major international conference). And I asked if it was anything interesting and if i was allowed to sit in on the conference. And I wasn't. So I didn't really see the point of that. Looking back now, I do, since his hotel was basically at the conference site.

Anyway, we meet up the next day at the meeting point and talk a bit before the tour starts. He seemed like an okay guy. We start the tour and he wants to take some photos and he realises his phone memory was too full and couldn't take any photos. I asked if he could delete stuff off his phone, apps, documents, photos etc. and he wouldn't budge. So he asks if he could take photos with mine instead and send them to him after. I say okay since its a new phone so has alot of memory and takes decent-ish photos.

So he uses my phone to take photos of the buildings, the architecture, etc etc. During the tour, he started leaning into me a lot of the times when we stopped, put his arm around my shoulders, tried to hold my hand, all of which I didnt respond positively too. So there was no encouragement from my side. I explain to him that I don't have much experience dating and that I am pretty naive with all this stuff. I told him I'm my parents' perfect daughter since they've been so strict growing up and they don't even know I'm going out on dates now.

We then met up with some of my friends for lunch (cause I was super uncomfortable alone with this guy), and then he insists on me coming to his hotel room. He gives the excuse of the photos to transfer them to his laptop (WhatsApp and Google drive werent good enough for him). He also tried to guilt trip me into spending the rest of the evening with him and when I said i had plans he basically said i could sleep over in his hotel room. I made it pretty clear the first time he mentioned me going to his hotel room that its not happening, ever. But he was so insistent. It really got on my nerves and those of my friends too. It was just so overwhelming and uncomfortable.

He also wanted to meet the next day at 10am before he took his flight at 6pm, and I said I couldnt since I'm going out with friends tonight and Ill be too tired by tomorrow morning. He again guilt tripped me into meeting by saying I'm leaving him alone. His behaviour was really appalling and I was just so tired of him and wanted to get away asap.

Anyway, I left with my friends after lunch and headed home and he headed to his hotel. He sends me two pictures of the beach which I didnt reply too. That night around 2am, while im out with my friends, he texts me asking where i am, what Im doing and when I didnt reply he called me a few times. He texts again to make sure that we're meeting tomorrow, to which I do finally reply saying, *""Ill decide tomorrow but i dont guarantee it.""*

The next morning around 9am he texts me again and when I dont reply, cause I am dead tired, he calls a few times, messages again, guilt trips me and I just dont bother hoping he'd get the hint. I text him later when I know for sure he's at the airport that, I was too tired and our date was too overwhelming for me. And wish him a safe flight back. And I proceed to block him everywhere. His number, on whatsapp, email as well and the app ofcourse.

But I forgot about the photos, so over the next few days I am bombarded with texts and calls from this guy. He figures out I blocked him so he uses a few different number to try and get through. He emails me which I find in my Spam account. I am pretty alarmed at this point and scared. So I unblock him and send him the photos (there are around 150+ photos and WhatsApp only allows you to send 30 at a time...) over WhatsApp with the message:

*""Here are your photos. Apologies for the silence and the delay. Please do not contact me again. It is scary and alarming. So please respect that.""*

And I wait until the photos send and block him again and delete the photos from my phone. But no. That's not enough for this guy.

He calls me, emails me, texts me again. Also from different emails and numbers. Asking for the all the ""Original, High resolution photos."" I try to ignore this guy hoping he'd go away but no he doesnt. He keeps calling and emailing me over and over again. Finally today, I open my inbox and theres an email with my father's name as the sender. And the subject ""Please upload all original, high resolution photos."".

**And he's now threatening me to send him the photos or he will tell my parents and my entire family. We've basically gone from him just knowing my first name to finding out my last name and the names of everyone in my family and even go to the lengths of creating a separate email in my father's name to get my attention.**

[https://imgur.com/a/veMIbtn](https://imgur.com/a/veMIbtn) \--> Email with the personal info blacked out. Ive screenshots of everything. Every phone number he's used and emails.

This guy has basically stalked me to the point where I don't really know who to turn to, I've told my parents about this so they know the situation. They're not too happy with me and feel like I've broken their trust. They will of course support me and plan an arranged marriage simultaneously haha. 0.0

Also, this guy didn't hesitate to tell me when we just met that he a ""director"" at one of these really big Indian companies and later on that his mum is a really good lawyer. I mean, he's got friends in high places I guess.

I am lucky to have my parents support and that of my friends.

I know I might be naive, but this is next level. This guy has harassed me and now resorted to blackmailing me. Its crazy. How entitled can one person be? Why cant this guy just let it go? Its like he's punishing me for not sleeping with him and rejecting him and he's using the excuse of the photos to prove his superiority. And the fact that he's bringing my parents into it. Its not about the photos at all at this point. It more of a power play because he's had his ego bruised.

&#x200B;

EDIT: So an apology is in order. I'm terribly sorry for this post coming off as racist, not my intention. No excuses, so I wont try to make any. I completely understand NOT all Indian men respond this way and are like this guy, and looking at the support from this group, that sentiment is reinforced. :)

**LAST EDIT:** And I won't be replying to comments either after this since most of you have already made up your minds about me being ""racist"" just based on the title alone and ignored the rest of the post. Some of you need to take a very long hard look at yourselves. I did expect a certain degree of skepticism and critique, its Reddit after all, but the amount of hate I'm receiving feels like I've personally entered each and every one of your homes, and insulted everyone in your family, spat in your food, and dissed your mothers. Shame on all of you. I'm human after all, and it wasn't the best choice of title, I make mistakes that if you'd taken the time to read the post you would've realised I'm not the most street smart of the bunch. But no, you decided to fixate on the 8 words of the title rather than the \~1500 words of the post. Not only that, some guy (congrats on your 0.002 secs of fame) even condemned me to die alone and none of you even seemed to think that was wrong, and even upvoted this losers comment, just because I'm ""racist"" and probably deserve it. 

This post and your response to it just proves that your (obviously not *ALL* men, God forbid *ALL* men) fragile egos are so easily bruised, that its even possible to offend *en masse.* No where in my post do I mention anything even remotely ""racist"", but hey since everyone decided to ride the ""she's racist"" train, this fact is completely overlooked. And the fact that I've been flipping harassed and stalked by some douchebag also overlooked. You've already decided I'm one of those ""Western Indian girls"" and assumed to know exactly the type of ""girl"" I am, then you're guilty of your own generalisation here. I may be naive, but I'm don't scare easily either, and I'm standing up for myself against the barrage of hate, bullsh!t and insults thrown my way. Give yourselves a pat on the back for your creative little insults then try and remember there's a human being behind the text and that a little empathy doesn't hurt. Things you've commented here would not be your first response to anyone you know in person. So scurry off to your keyboards and think of some more roasts to hide behind, AIB might startup again and looking to hire. Ah, and don't forget to incorporate how naive, foolish and ""racist"" I am. Thanks for driving that nail in a little harder. 

That being said, a sincere thank you to the commenters who've been extremely helpful and given fantastic advice. I haven't decided what course of action to take as of now. Filing a complaint with the police seems tedious given the distance and I honestly do not want to stress my parents out any more than they already are. I've replied to the last email informing him that the photos were deleted after the WhatsApp send and again said never to contact me again and have had no reply. My parents haven't heard from him either so everything is alright on that front too. I am seriously considering filing the complaint though but not just yet. Ill do my best to keep you updated, if there are any updates. :)",1573330468.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,242,215

3. How much should I expect to pay these people?  
4. Considering I'm only applying to a select few universities, how should I go about choosing the right consultant?

board with our expenses. Most of us would have committed financial blunders at least once. 

Since I see lot of youngsters in this sub, maybe going through the post might help them make better financial decisions. 

1. Bought a car worth 10L, it is really helpful for travelling but since I travel out of station a lot, most of the time the car is lying un-used and I feel I unnecessarily succumbed to the peer pressure of owning a car as a status symbol.  

2. Impulsive trips with friends just because there was money in my account. Taking trips is not wrong, but going on trips without doing any savings was stupid. 

3. Buying 3 phones of around 30k each in the last 6 years. 

4. Not following budgeting and spending money just because I had money.
