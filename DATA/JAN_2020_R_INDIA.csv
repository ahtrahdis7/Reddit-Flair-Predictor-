4,"Indian Student Variety AbroadSo, I am kinda feeling burned out right now and felt like loosing some steam. I am an Indian studying in Ireland for some XX engineering. Met with a variety of Indian students, and I must say it is a very mixed bunch. Wanted to share some of my observations and NOT JUDGEMENT.

1. After coming out of the airport:

Type1: Whoa! Everything is so awesome here unlike India. Look at the car - amazing, bus - wow, people - so \*good looking\*, crow - so \*good looking\*, the dog poop - so awesome.

Type2: What is so good here? Everything available here is also there back home and best. Period! No country has a long history, culture and diversity like India. This place has no specialty.  

2. Food 

Type1: I am a proud \*PURE\* vegetarian, I don't eat beef and pork, I eat only halal, I don't eat beef but eat pork, I cannot find my rice variety, I cannot find brinjal or ladysfinger (unaware of the terms eggplant and okra), I cannot find masala, this has no spice, that has no salt, those are raw , I miss Zomato coupons and goes on..... 

Type2: I am hungry, I will eat anything except humans. However I'll pass the chicken dish which is sweet 

(The concept of anything sweet as part of the main course/entre and not desert is very alien. Sweet Chicken... Yucks)

3. Social Life

Type1: Super extrovert and mixes and mingles well with everyone, does not care if no one laughs at his jokes or does not invite him to a party. He is always the jolly guy. After some initial awkwardness he fits easily into the multi national groups.

Type2: Mostly hangs out with other Indians, specifically people who share the same regional language. Does not bother with other nationalities. But secretly wishes he was part of the multi national group and had friends who are white, black, brown, asian, hispanic....

4. Enjoyment

Type1: Comes from a business family, does not care about the currency conversion rate, parties like hell, everyday Instagram posts, good sex life, frequent outdoor and party tours, branded clothes-shoes-electronics-underwear, lives in good accommodation.

Type2: Comes from a middle class family, always keeps the bank balance in mind before spending 1 penny, kinda has a ledger in the head of the bank loan/ dad's money/ relative's money/self money, spends only on essentials, mental currency conversion is faster than google.

There are varieties in other categories like accent, etiquette, mentality, clothing etc. which is broadly divided into directly copying from the locals or actively resisting it.

But I will say that the average academic quality of students is below the bar. Most of them are do not give a crap about what is being taught in the class and somehow manages to pass(A lot of them get caught in plagiarism cases, conflicts in group activity). Since the day he lands, one eye is always on the job market, PR, part-time etc. Having said that a few of them are REALLY good and do great work in the university. They are kinda like the engines of the 'India' brand train while the rest are coaches. 

I have been an international student for 8 months and came across this variety. Diversity in India is present in every aspect.

Thank you for your patience and time.

Good Day.

All views are personal. Do add to this variety list if you feel like.",1580486146.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,6,13

My mind is making me hollow and I'm progressively being driven to insanity. That maybe is an exaggeration but I'm suffering. I tend to overthink which exacerbates my situation. I can feel the pressure on my head.


That fretful feeling steadily rises from my abdomen and eventually I'm overwhelmed. There have been instances when I've had to sit myself down to tackle this. I visited a doctor and much to my dismay they weren't able to remedy this.

I'm tired, I really am. I've been bawling for the past few minutes to expel those toxic emotions from my system. I couldn't have ever imagined that my thoughts, something that's a part of me could pose such a danger.

I often withdraw from situations especially those that are competitive because my mind tells me I'd lose. Obvious ramifications of an uncontrolled mind are low self esteem, unhappiness, hopelessness.

If the answer is I dono what to do ?

Let it be  a student asking your elders for help with studies .
If you are a adult asking your boss, guru, teacher about something way to complex or so it may seem at that point to solve the first thing that they say is you should try doing it yourself first ?
Duhhh...

Sometimes I feel I should just make up a solution its not lying if you do feel that could work .

Is there a way to ask people for help ?
How can I avoid the same old advice?

Background - Recently I got into a friendly argument with a fellow redditor over CAA/NRC who told me why Muslim minorities like rohingyas should not reside in the country. I had heard the term before but didn't knew anything about them. So I took a day, did a bit of research and this is what I found out.

(Side note - I would recommend you to Google rohingyas and read about them yourself even if you know about them. You might learn something new.)


1. THE ROHINGYA PEOPLE are an ethnic group from Myanmar, once called Burma. Most live in Rakhine State on Myanmar’s western coast.

Myanmar is a majority-Buddhist state, but the Rohingya people are primarily Muslim, though a small number are Hindu. The ethnic minority is considered “the most persecuted minority in the world” by the United Nations.
Source- https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/people/reference/rohingya-people/

2. The Rohingya population is denied citizenship under the 1982 Myanmar nationality law. They are also restricted from freedom of movement, state education and civil service jobs.
The official stance of the Government of Myanmar is that the Rohingya peoples are citizens of Bangladesh, as a result of the British partitioning of their Asian possessions.
Source - https://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/burma/burm005-02.htm#P132_34464

3.The Rohingya conflict is an ongoing conflict in the northern part of Myanmar's Rakhine State (formerly known as Arakan), characterised by sectarian violence between the Rohingya Muslim and Rakhine Buddhist communities, a military crackdown on Rohingya civilians by Myanmar's security forces, and militant attacks by Rohingya insurgents in Buthidaung, Maungdaw, and Rathedaung Townships, which border Bangladesh.

An August 2018 study by Harvard University estimated that in the same period, 24,000 Rohingyas had been killed, 18,000 Rohingya women and girls had been raped, 116,000 Rohingyas had been beaten, and 36,000 Rohingyas had been victims of arson.

Source - https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326912213_Forced_Migration_of_Rohingya_The_Untold_Experience

Entire Muslim Rohingya villages in Myanmar have been demolished and replaced by police barracks, government buildings and refugee relocation camps, the BBC has found.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49596113

4. Read this slowly and carefully again. 
Using statistical extrapolations based on surveys conducted with a total of 3,321 Rohingya refugee households in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh, a study estimated in January 2018 that during the genocide, the military and the local Rakhine Buddhists killed at least 24,000 Rohingya people, gang rapes and other forms of sexual violence against 18,000 Rohingya Muslim women and girls, 116,000 Rohingya were beaten, and 36,000 Rohingya were thrown into fire.

In Myanmar, the government is destroying Rohingya villages and the physical evidence of the killings that took place there

5.""If there was one thing almost everyone who has monitored Muslim Rohingya in Rakhine State agreed on, it was that sooner or later their plight would breed militant resistance to the authority of the state.""-Jonathan Head, 
South East Asia correspondent, BBC

Rohingya Muslim militants in Myanmar killed dozens of Hindu civilians during attacks last August, according to an investigation by Amnesty International.

But today that changed. Because this baboon known Arnab decided to broadcast lies. Lies for hours and hours, the shooter being a protestor and what not. Right now, he’s supporting the shooters troubled mind that he was coerced into firing a weapon, when this man didn’t even need to fire in self defense.

378,"Liberals, you are next, unless you start speaking up rather than just 'condemning every act'.Since my last post, I am getting accused of 'being as bad as the bhakts I despise' or 'you are a nazi yourself' or like a supreme genius said 'you are comparing with today's India with Nazis and doing mental gymnastics.' 

Yesterday, a Hindutva terrorist shot an innocent bystander while dumb bhakts under the guise of being a centrist bombarded me with 'how others spread fake news against supreme leader Modiji'.

A union minister calls for 'shooting desh ke gaddar.' and his follower who has photos with venom spewing right wing members actually shoots a protestor. Arnab as usual spread fake news about the gunman saying he belonged to the protest itself and wasn't a Hindutva terrorist. OpIndia defended gunman saying 'he was  running backward from Islamist mob'

and here we were, telling our liberal brothers and sisters that you can't really defend right wing freedom of speech because their speech gets people killed. but without understanding that, liberals called me a Nazi when I did NOT ask for shooting of RSS/BJP members.

&#x200B;

Another genuis said 'i'll rather die like a dog in the street than become a Nazi like you' when I reminded him of what happend to German liberals who defended Nazi freedom of speech in the 1930s (they were shot dead by the same Nazis like dogs on the street). I even imagined what title Arnab will have on his show. ""After the TUKDE TUKDE GANG, we have the CONDEMNATION gang. Will they ever stop working for Pakistan?""

you have to pick between defending Nazis and making India into a Nazi dictatorship or DEMOCRACY.

the codemnation gang who condemns 'even the act of confronting, what Kamra did to Arnab' because 'arnab was private individual'

hell, arnab doesn't show the same courtesy to Muslims, Dalits. why should he be given his private space anywhere? he openly peddles venom and fake news. no. that isn't covered under freedom of speech and if you think it is, then you are just like that German liberal who tolerated Nazi intolerance, was too spineless to oppose it and who was then shot dead by the same Nazis.

&#x200B;

**Democracy is at stake now. if you keep condemning what Karma did then you will directly  be responsible for making India a dictatorship. Because that's what German liberals did. They would 'rather die than open their fucking eyes to reality' and they did just that and because of that, millions of Jews were treated as animals and gassed or shot dead or burnt alive. IT isn't your armchair 'neutrality' at stake. it is the very concept of democracy.**

if it had been a muslim guy shooting anyone he'd directly be linked to ISIS or Hizbul or  some other pan Islamist organisation. they'd have 'recovered' left wing books form his place and then did a sedition case against him.

Guess what liberals, you'll just have condemned government for their action against him. Like you are condemning the gunman and Kamra right now.

Nope. you are either enabling Hindutva or you are opposing Hindutva by calling out whats wrong.

The only reason we aren't a dictatorship is that people have protested on the street by risking their very lives while you condemned everything sitting on your armchair.

Edit: for some reason I'm being told that liberals opposed Modi and idiots like me voted for him. I'm not blaming liberals for Modi's election.

I'm not blaming liberals at all

I'm warning liberals because of liberals are liberal to Hindutva terrorists then liberals will be shot dead in the streets like dogs by the same hindutv terrorist whom liberals so vociferously defended yesterday",1580436905.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,73,278

I specifically asked for no FUP. I would also get a year of Prime as well as Netflix. I asked how many screens, he said 4. Paid the 1000/- installation fee and got the connection 

As soon as the connection was up, I got an SMS saying I would be charged 299/- as a “data pack” on my Unlimited Connection? Like wtf man.

Sent an e-mail to the customer care and got a reply the next day. 

She said it was a mistake on their end and since the bill wasn’t made yet, they would correct it. And I won’t be getting Netflix since the offer has expired. I mean wtf? i got the connection yesterday and the offer has expired. Turns out the offer expired on 15th Jan.

Motherfuckers lied to me. Not only on the billing but also on Netflix. Instead they just removed the “data pack” and now I have a limited 300gb plan at 200mbps for 999+ tax . Motherfuckers.

It was well known he was a hard left individual, with interests in the Russian revolution's Marxist and Socialist policies. He was a patriot and nationalist but never thrived off of it. In my view, it was the best kind of *positive* nationalism wherein you respected and fought for your nation's freedom and dignity but also participated in the active growth of its people from a moral and economical standpoint and did not rely on relentless fanning of the flames to attain unity.

Imagine an India which was built on strong but fair leftist grounds which stressed on equality of sexes, equality of opportunity, **mandatory education**, economic liberation, powerful military and more with equal stress on India being Democratic Republic. 

> Subhash Chandra Bose never interpreted nationalism in its narrow ,perverted and aggressive form. He viewed Indian nationalism from the stand point of  a humanist To3 Bose ,‘Indian nationalism is neither narrow, nor selfish, nor aggressive.It is inspired by the highest ideals of the human race.


There is unequivocally nothing that can really beat this combination of non-exploitative, non-authoritarian socialist country. I know some think-tanks have flirted with the idea of Bose being a ""Hitler"" but one, he was pro-Democracy and two:


> “When I first visited Germany in 1933, I had hopes that the new German nation, which has risen to a new consciousness of its national strength and self-respect, would instinctively feel a deep sympathy for other nations struggling in the same direction.Today,I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish, but also arrogant”

In my opinion, India should have been under a rigorous leadership for a decade or so to set the grounds for **mass education**, equal opportunities, equality of sexes, liberal economic principles and abolition of poverty AND THEN gone on to open up the market internationally and engage in (controlled) Capitalistic ventures where you invest in foreign countries and foreign countries can invest in yours, independent businesses can thrive and so on and which will see a surge in not only economic status but exchange of culture with the people of India **ready for such a venture** as opposed to now where most Indians barely know who they are, what their history is and what their culture is about.",1580442331.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,42,4

452,"Kunal-Goswami incident and the reactions on it tell us a very interesting thing about this government. Excessive reaction is a strategy by the ruling [P]arty.I for one believe that Arnab didn't deserve it even now. But Kamra is getting punished severely enough to consider it as political bullying. No-fly list is a huge thing, and affects your professional and personal life. Kamra did not deserve being banned by 4 airlines, no matter what. He deserved some punishment maybe (we don't know all the facts and the victim hasn't had a chance to defend himself under the legal system), but in any case, not this severe.. 

Many of us empathized with Arnab this time. Then Arnab's Channel lies about the whole shooting incident. And it makes most of us revert to our original stance.

Common theme of government is to act so much in excess that there is no scope for nurturing moderates in the country. Always keep people fighting at the extremes, because no one is more dangerous than the moderates who aren't passionate about any side in particular. Things happening with Kamra, or JNU or Jamia, even Kashmir or Assam, all are on the same theme. Even CAA that blatantly left out Muslims. 
The idea here is to leave no scope for moderate analysis of the situation, be so blatant in what you do that you always end up creating polar arguments between the blind followers and the ""opposers/traitors"" where nuances of the discussion are lost.

It's like those scammers who purposefully use flawed English to weed out any moderately intelligent people who will recognize the scam late in the game and waste the scammer's time. Being absolutely blatant ensures that the blindest bhakts stick to you, and then take drastic abhorrent measures so that the bhakts face severe criticism and become even more loyal due to a perceived ""persecution complex.""

497,"I just read about the shooter in the news paper.I saw some stuff that caught my interest as a student of psychology, I was reading Dainik Bhaskar, 

date: 31/01/2020, 

The news paper mentioned that the shooter was in grade 12th, i.e. he wasn't fully an adult, and his temperament was converting to a personality, this gives us the way to look at a few facts: 

1. He was a part, or if not a part, was associated with a hindutva organization (name not specified)

2. He met and became associated to the organization during his visits to his wrestling (kushti) club.

3. Recently, in the 15 days prior to the attack, he was very mentally distressed.

4. He used to shout slogans of Jai Shree Ram for no apparent reason, even at home.

5. He was in 12 grade and had to go to a wedding party, he had agreed to go to the party (after school), but never went there, instead headed off to shoot the protesters. 

Now if we look at part one, it's very clear that the organization must have been feeding him propaganda.

In part two, he went to a kushti club, although a lot of people go out of interest, in this particular instance, he seems to have a power fantasy, due to an insecurity deep down, he wanted to be powerful, the association with the organization must have been a result of meeting people similar to him, having a power fantasy, as it is seen in most of these organizations.

Part three shows that there was some cognitive dissonance in him, as he was very distressed, it was either due to the fact that his exams might be approaching, but here, he went off at the protesters, which gives us a fact that he was distressed with people not agreeing to his fantastical views.

Part four shows him shouting slogans for no apparent reason or provocation/trigger, he was justing shouting these here and there, it might be showing some schizoaffective/schizotypal traits, and a delusion and need to get people's attention towards his views, which were fed to him by the organization.

Part four also shows him being somewhat brainwashed by the organization.

Part five shows him either lying, or being unsure towards his family members and school, he prioritized shooting at protesters more than going to a family function, which he had said he would come to, also being in 12th grade, and the month being January, this shows he wasn't too sincere and/or wasn't interested in school.

Mind you, he was only in 12th, his personality and/or temperament was very moldable, he could've easily been made a victim of brainwashing and feeding of these thoughts.

This all is just my perspective and view/opinion, I am not exactly saying this might be the case, please be gentle. Thank you. 

Also, I would love to see the views of fellow psychologists, psychiatrists and psychology students here. What do they think ?

Thank you once again.",1580447263.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,24,26

515,"We're not having the right conversationsIn the wake of recent events. I can't help but notice how the conversations we're having either aren't focused on the right questions or aren't pursued with the degree of tenacity that is warranted.

The effective headline about the Arnab-Kamra incident is 'Man creates nuisance on a flight, inconveniences a co-passanger'. That is all. Any conversation about privacy or even a malevolent intent on part of Kamra is immaterial. The bigger issue at hand is the government disproportionately and unjustly using its power/influence to get a citizen banned from airlines because of his views to send out a message of intimidation by directly affecting his livelihood. It isn't a left or right issue. All the conversations of 'But what Kamra did was xyz' are immaterial. Even considering that what Kamra did was not right, the vindictive disparity in response by those in power to the wrongdoings of those they consider are with them or against them is what's shocking.

And this pattern of misdirection and pointless arguments is repeated with every major news event. The frustration is with the utter lack of accountability and the failure of if at all any regulatory mechanisms that are supposed to be in place. 
It is not surprising that a politician makes communal statements. Communalism is a part of our society, just as racism is a part of others. And they will be as long as there will be people. For a good few years now I have felt more restless thinking 'How this person say that? And how is this person not being held accountable for saying this?' whenever I read a headline about a politician or an influential person spewing absolute poisonous garbage. It is inherent for a politician to be disingenuous and try to stoke the worst prejudices in society for political mileage, I feel angrier at those who don't call them out on it and hold them accountable.


An altercation on a flight turns into a privacy issue. An attack inside a university turns into a left right issue. An man brandishing a gun at a crowd and injuring a person turns into a Hindu Muslim issue. Can we for the love of God stop getting sucked into these narrow binary discussion and have better conversation? 

About the Kamra issue, here's a question which I feel is more relevant.

What is the right way to hold a journalist who is a partisan hack accountable? It seems like we've been making fun of him forever, but nothing has diminished his influence and popularity. Should we start calling him out in public? Is that the way? Should we starve him of attention by stopping to watch his channel? Should we as consumers put pressure on the sponsors of his channel letting them know we don't want them advertising on his shows? Is that the way? 


I am not being holier-than-thou. I am guilty of the same. But after an insurmountable pile of every issue turning into a discussion between 'sides', my mind is fucked up. So, if anyone has sources of information that are beyond the realm of this and actually has elevated conversations, please do share.",1580408009.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,3,23

Let's point out again, for those audience here who love to divert attention from the real topic... ""Isn't Arnab a human, isn't this bad..."" Blah blah. Yes it is. No one is allowed to heckle into anyone's privacy while flying or doing anything. Were the words used by him justified? No they aren't.

 It's been mentioned Kunal did it twice, he should had handled it well. The right blames us for not understanding the context of the argument. Well if that's the case and neither are we in anyway justifying it but why don't you also contextualise the injustice and trauma that lead to Rohit's death. Why can't we contextualise that this is the emotional reaction after Arnab's contradictions.  ""Oh shiiid we don't talk about that"" well alright lets see what Vinit Goenka said on an NDTV debate, ""play the video.. blah blah.. **forget the rules**"" ...the literal fuck?  

The eagerness to which the actions were taken. If that's what they call instant justice by the airlines let's also point out the greviences the airlines have on so many passengers. Who the Fuck is go air and spicejet to even talk about it? Unruly behaviour is what makes spice Jet .. spice Jet.  Do they really have any regardz towards the law? Where's the investigation? Where's the enquiry? Oh now Twitter's the medium to get someone banned? Is it just another case like what happened with the rapists in Hyderabad? Instant justice? That's where we're heading to?

Don't tell me now that republic tv isn't in anyway faaaar from this. They are quiet...Why? Coz Arnab knows that's the same behavioral principle he follows. That's what his cast follows. Kunal's video is trending at #6 now. All the evidences to back his case is present.",1580365050.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,13

560,"Social media companies must be held responsible for the incident today as well.The way Twitter and Facebook and other social media companies have let hate-mongers use their platform to peddle hatred and openly call for violence against marginalized groups is abhorrent and the inaction that these companies have shown in the face of rising bigotry on their platform is just as appalling. Just the other day I had reported a bunch of tweets calling for violence against protestors in ShaheenBagh and yet after more than 96 hours, these tweets are still on their platform. Compare that with how effectively they shut down the calls for violence in the US where they shut down the whole accounts for shit way less serious than that.  
They shouldn't be allowed to get away with this. They should be pressured into acting more effectively against hate-mongering on their platforms.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

T**he whole world needs to be on alert now. The whole world needs to take action: WHO**

I  will try to compile a list of live update links, research, potential  warning and helpful materials related corona virus outbreak in this  thread. My heart goes to infected peoples and all the souls of the  world. Nearly 170+ people died in China and worldwide, more than 7,783  are confirmed infected as of *Jan 29, 2020 9 pm EST*,  Chinese expert predictions says potential 12000+ might be infected  more. The rate of the death tolls and infection this is a world epidemic  crisis. I never imagined this scene of virus epidemic coming to us like  straight out of a Hollywood movie. Praying for all humanity.

Share your thoughts, folks.

India  just got confirmed first corona virus in Kerela, Our country has no preparations in order to contain and fight this possible outbreak, Emergency security measures should be taken ASAP to contain possible spread in India in my Opinion. This has already spread in our neighbor countries, we must prepare.

&#x200B;

**India Latest:** *Updated Jan. 30, 2020*

*2 confirmed Indian infected.* 

a) *One from Tripura dead in Malaysia.*

b) One in kerela fighting for life in Kerala.

**Precautions for Coronavirus Infection:**

The Health Ministry has issued an advisory on the precautions that one can take to prevent coronavirus infection:

— If you have recently traveled to China (within last 14 days) or  had possible contact with an nCoV infected person, it is advised to:

— Stay in home isolation for 14 days after your return

— Sleep in a separate room

— Limit contact with other family members and avoid visitors

— Cover nose and mouth when coughing and sneezing

— Avoid close contact with anyone with cold or flu-like symptoms

The virus is airborne.

## How to protect yourself

There are currently no vaccines available to protect you against  human coronavirus infection. You may be able to reduce your risk of  infection by doing the following

&#x200B;

* wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds
* avoid touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands
* avoid close contact with people who are sick

## Recommendations

**1. Minimize Chance for Exposures**

2. Ensure Adherence to Standard, Contact and Airborne Precautions

3. Cloth masks are ineffective towards Corona virus

4. Don't visit China, try to cut foreign travel. Virus has spread in more than 15 countries.

Remember when Chupublic TV launched and they hounded Shashi Tharoor? SO much so that the Judiciary had to ORDER Chupublic TV to shut the fuck about the death of Pushkar?

Also Arnab is the epicenter of the hatemongering right wing media apparatus. Because of his venom spewing, people actually die. The worst Kamra did was annoy the rest of the passengers for 2 minutes. Nobody is going to lynch Right wing folks because of what Kamra did.

these fascists boot lickers of the government have to be taught a lesson and this is the perfect way to do so. This is non violent and it brings about attention to how much sycophant the businesses are.

Before Anti CAA protests, whatever BJP did, the stars and cricketers immediately supported. it is because we spoke out that these stars kept mum and feigned ignorance. why? WE are their audience, they earn money by fooling us into buying products or by watching their dumb matches (hello BCCI, which isn't even a government body) or their bollywood movies.

&#x200B;

I have read what happened to the liberal socialists who supported 'freedom of speech' of venom spewing Nazis. They were shot dead, right after Nazis killed Jews, Gypsies, deformed, mentally unstable and the rest.

&#x200B;

This is the price u have to pay for democracy.

if reporters can heckle, harass a plane full of passengers because they want to interview someone (I think it was BJP candidate Tejaswi Suriya himself who faced this) then we can surely make right wing hate mongers realise that they live in a society, that there are people and thoughts outside of their echo chamber.

Remember the german song

&#x200B;

first they came for the communists, I wasn't one so I didn't care

then they came for the jews, I wasn't one so I didn't care

then they came for the unionists, I wasn't one so I didn't care

then they came after me and there was nobody left to defend me.

&#x200B;

Right wing is following what Nazis did. They started out small and always had outrage when someone other than their ideology did something like Kamra did and we stupid liberals supported their 'freedom of speech'

Be intolerant of intolerance.

&#x200B;

Just look at twitter, despite having an impressive Twitter bot collection, BJP hasn't been able to win a narrative war. why? because people are awake. we need to fight and be vigilant.

eternal vigilance is the price of democracy.

or in other words, if Shivaji Maharaj's praja had done an outrage on the killing of Afzhal Khan, that he had 'freedom of speech' or 'he was a guest' then this great empire wouldn't have survived till 1818. Before him, all Hindu kings were linient on others those who were cunning, Prithviraj Chouhan defeted some king for 3 times and let him go. the same guy came for the 4th time, defected Chouhan and that was the end of Prithviraj. (and now, for God's sake, don't take this in a Panipat or Tanaji the unsund warrior way.)

667,"My interaction with my old (Bhakt) friendsI was home alone last night so I invited 2 of my old buddies for a drink at my place. One of them knew that I am a Kattar (Hardcore) Modi hater so they kept asking me stupid shit like who's winning the Delhi elections while passing a smile to each other. (They think BJP is gonna win Delhi elections) I recently broke with my ex, she was a Muslim (I'm a Hindu brahmin as my family claims. Bull&%#t), so the guy who knew my political views used to ask me: How's your relationship going? So after his who's winning the election statement I told him a lie that she was a bitch, we broke up because she was against this CAA and NRC acts and said a few more things to gain their trust, they opened up before that. Let me share a few observations:

1. He loved the Rockstar movie, he praised the track (Kun faya Kun) but said I can't listen as it's by a Muslim (Dargah scene and AR Rehman sung it who's a Hindu by birth)
2. They hate Muslims like hell, they are waiting for a civil war actually. (That guy had a couple of Muslim friends who were childhood friends actually)
3. I talked to them about Tenet (Christopher Nolan's upcoming movie), They said we don't watch pictures from abroad artists.
4. They believe all the theories by Modi as they are universal truths.
5. They shared ground incidents about Jamia incident, as per them: protest was peaceful but an AAP member (Muslim) gave a speech and within 15 Mins the riots started. (Whatsapp University)
6. They shared a funny video of some 'Amit Bhadana' type illiterate guy who made fun of Anti CAA protestor and I kept acting like I'm loving that shit.
7. They talked shit about Shaheen Bagh ladies.  
Then they showed me a video of JNU incident by the same guy asking for Azadi 'from country', I am not a JNU student neither I know any of them personally at all but I do have solidarity with all of them and I'M PROUD OF WHAT THEY ARE DOING, THE WAY THEY TAKE A STAND FOR US. So being a DRUNK Delhiite I lost my patience and beat the shit out of one them in rage and now I'm typing this shit from Police Station while my Lawyer is talking about my bail. Lol.I do study psychology for fun (I'm obsessed with Sherlock Holmes deduction - Benedict) so I analyze people just for fun. These people need to be sent to rehab IMMEDIATELY. We don't need detention centers in this country but we do need Rehabs for these fuckers.

To anyone who is gonna speak that ""You Delhi people are like this only"", Well I've attended almost every major protest in New Delhi, I've been dealing with these Bhakts 24x7 from past few months, I had a serious mental blockage, if you are anti-BJP you can't even speak freely with people anymore.

You will turn inhumane after a point if you're gonna keep all this inside yourself for too long, I am not gonna justify what I did was right or wrong, but if you are dealing with some bullshit then TALK SO SOMEBODY before you go crazy.

Funny time we are living in, We can't even share our political views with our own parents anymore.

You can attend a protest but you have to lie to people in your locality about that. You are secular but you have to act as per people's feelings when you are around them.NO MORE. F&#k you!

I'm a 24 year old person and already flunked twice in college. Cleared my BE in 2019, and flunked only in one subject. Been trying to get that out of the way, still failed. I have 6 months' time for retrial.

Because of the results that declared this month, I feel lost and hopeless. That one subject is in the way of getting a job. Yeah, I know I shouldn't be blaming that and should try harder than before instead. But the thing is, I really need a job. I'm unable to give interviews. This makes me feel like absolutely useless garbage, as I already have that 2 year gap.

My parents are already shit-talking about my failure and compare me with their relatives (I don't blame them, they had high expectations of me after all) and I'm tired of it. I have isolated myself from all my friends who have gotten a job and instead giving a try on freelancing.

It depresses me that I'm getting older and older without financial strength. It's too dependent of me to live on my parents' income forever.

>
>This email is to address the events that occurred on 6E5317, BOM-LKO on 28.01.2020. After pushback I was informed by the LCA that 2 gentlemen were involved in a verbal altercation and that it had been noticed prior to commencement of the flight. One was seated on 13A (Mr. Kunal Kamra) and the other on 1B (Mr. Arnab Goswami). I was informed that Mr. Kamra had tried to engage with Mr. Goswami, who did not respond.
> 
> Mr. Kamra was asked by the LCA to return to his seat as the safety demonstrations were underway and the seat belt signs were on. Upon receiving this instruction, Mr. Kamra apologised to the LCA and returned to his seat. After passing 10,000 ft, the cabin crew commenced their preparations for service, but the seat belt signs remained on the entire flight. After the start of cabin service, the flight deck was contacted by the LCA to inform us that Mr. Kamra was back in the passenger aisle by Row 1 speaking in a raised voice to Mr. Goswami. She mentioned that she was informed by a passenger that Mr. Kamra had briefly used abusive language.
> 
> Upon hearing this I turned the surveillance on from the cockpit to observe the events at Row 1. I noticed Mr. Kamra gesticulating to Mr. Goswami who was unresponsive. I did not observe any physical contact between the two gentlemen at any point. At this time I made a Passenger Address to the cabin asking the gentleman standing in the passenger aisle near Row 1 to return to his seat, and that any disagreements they may have could be sorted out on the ground after the conclusion of the flight.
> 
> Mr. Kamra upon hearing this immediately apologised again to the LCA, relayed an apology to me via the LCA and subsequently returned to his seat. A few minutes after this, I turned on the surveillance again to check the status of the forward cabin area. I noticed a number of passengers crowding around the forward area waiting to use the lavatory and - in my opinion - to get a better look at Mr. Goswami. I noticed a passenger try to talk to Mr. Goswami. Not wanting to exacerbate this developing pattern, I made another Passenger Address reminding passengers that the seatbelt signs were still on and that we were expecting turbulence. I asked them to return to their seats, fasten their seatbelts and request the cabin crew for assistance if they needed to use the lavatories.
> 
> Upon making the announcement, the passengers vacated the forward galley, returned to their seats and a return to normalcy was observed. I then asked the LCA to speak with Mr. Goswami and inform him that the Flight Deck send their regards, and that if he wished to lodge a complaint, we would be happy to assist him after landing in Lucknow. He was also offered extra F&amp;B. He thanked the LCA and acknowledged the offer. After the flight when most passengers had deplaned, Mr. Kamra requested permission to enter the flight deck to speak with me to personally apologise again. He did so. I asked him if his issue was political in nature, which he confirmed. I advised him that while we are all entitled to our opinions, there was a time and place to voice them, and that mid-flight was no place for it. He agreed, thanked us and left the aircraft.
> 
> The flight deck crew briefly encountered Mr. Kamra again outside the LKO terminal where we were waiting for Hotel Transport. He apologised again and left. While Mr. Kamra’s behaviour was unacceptable and verbally abusive, at no point did he not comply with Crew instructions.
> 
> While he did briefly display Level 1 traits for Disruptive behaviour (ICAO Doc 9811), he was also immediately compliant of crew instruction, was never issued a red warning card and hence cannot be classified as such.
> 
> Furthermore, in-line with the IndiGo SEP Manual guidelines for Disruptive Behaviour, the situation was diffused, the passenger in question kept under observation and the cabin kept in lockdown for the duration of the flight. Hence, no further action on the part of the Cockpit Crew was required. The LCA advised me she would be filing a report on her end in-line with Cabin Crew guidelines.

> As Captain of 6E5317 BOM-LKO on 28.01.2020, I do not find the aforementioned events reportable in any way. Mr. Kamra’s behaviour while unsavoury, was NOT qualifying of a Level 1 Unruly passenger.
> 
> Indeed we pilots can all attest to incidents similar and/or worse in nature that were not deemed Unruly.
> 
> Furthermore, I was disheartened to learn that my Airline has taken action in this case solely on the basis of Social Media posts, with no consultation whatsoever with the Pilot-in-Command. This is somewhat unprecedented in my 9 years of Airline flying. Moving forward, am I to understand that the bar for interpretation of a Disruptive passenger is lower/different when it comes to high profile cases? Perhaps the SEP Manual is to be amended to reflect this? I would like a clarification from the Airline as this leaves a lot of room for ambiguity.

Backup in case the original tweet is deleted - archive[dot]is/kgup9

many people focus on the harshness of the penalty and whataboutery rather than pointing out much more terrifying aspect of the ordeal - **blatant disregard of process or law**

Let's say according to the DGCA law for such behavior the penalty was nationwide fly-ban(there isn't one), and let's say that the same penalty was not applicable in case of Sadhvi Pragya(who delayed a plane for 45mins) and Ravindra gaikwad(who confessed to hitting a crew member 25 times) and let's even ignore when Republic TV editor Deepti Sachdeva Heckled Tejaswi Yadav despite announcements by crew on Passenger address system. As the captain says if this is the definition of Level 1 offense then hundreds of passengers need to banned every week because, just like this one, the evidence will be readily available in all cases courtesy CCTV surveillance.  Let's ignore all that secondary issues and focus on what happened in this case.

*28th Jan*

04:20 PM - Kunal posts the video 

08:49 PM - IndiGo tweets and bans Kunal for 6 months

09:21 PM - Minister of the Nation, Hardeep Puri tweets - Govt *advises* other airlines to impose similar restrictions

10:39 PM - Air India tweets and bans Kunal 'till further notice'

*Next Day*

11:33 AM - Spicejet tweets and bans Kunal 'till further notice'

01:48 PM - GoAir tweets and bans Kunal 'till further notice'

*Today*

7:47 PM - Minister Tweets - ""I had expressed **my views** with regard to the unruly behavior of a passenger""

Points to be noted -

- Arnab himself didn't have the spine to lodge a complaint when offered the option

-  All the airlines took action within 24 hours of incident on the basis of a tweet by the Minister. All of them have tagged him in the tweets declaring ban

- As of now there has been no proof that DGCA sent any official notice/instruction to IndiGo with signature of director or secretaries or any other officer.  How can there be one?  Even the Pilot in command was not consulted, ignore his 'subjective' opinion about the incident. The undeniable and objective truth is that the Captain wasn't involved so there can be no official documentation. 

- Spicejet, GoAir and Air India can still be excused but not  IndiGo. What IndiGo did was far more shocking - they mentioned the length of the ban!!  And the rules clearly state that (1) Pilot in command has to initiate complaint (2) Committee consisting of a Retired Judge and others has to be set-up (3) For non-physical offence, max 3 months ban.  For physical offence, max 6months ban. (4) Passengers can also be banned while the committee reviews the matter, **but for no more than 30 days.**  And this was the shocking mistake by IndiGo, they didn't even read the rule-book in a hurry and made the mistake of mentioning length of the ban.


-  The other airlines are also trapped in some way because they too wouldn't have got any official DGCA notice. Their only excuse can be that they consider tweets to be official medium of communication and took **advice** given by minister


- They are already realizing that they messed up. Minister Hardeep Puri has just now backtracked by saying - ""I had expressed my views with regards to the incident"".  The problem is nobody gives a tiny rat's ass about *his views*. Only DGCA administrations view matters.


CONCLUSION - When khap panchayat decides to murder an inter caste couple, even they meet once and establish social consensus according to their own medieval protocol. This is worse, this is like a mafia don making a call and pressurizing  legitimate organizations. Law can be misused easily, IT raids and ED raids are an example but this is not misuse of law, **this is complete disregard of law by the govt to satiate the ego of Lord Bhow Bhow**",1580397214.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,6,156

This amazing yet flawed man, who believed in the seemingly impossible ideals of Truth, and Love was shot down, after five previous unsuccessful attempts at taking his life, for following and preaching what he believed in.

Fascists can not allow the prosperity of Love, compassion, and beauty for they are natural antidotes of Hate, the bread and butter of Fascists. They also detest truth because it often does not help in furthering their agenda of demonizing a people.

Today, it is the same Fascists, the same hate that we fight against, and to fight them we'll use the same tools the Mahatma used, we'll be non-violent, but we won't cower down, we'll be non-cooperative wherever required(Kagaz Nahi Dikhaenge), we'll fight till we see Truth, Beauty and Good prevail in our country.

858,"What Kunal Kamra did with Arban Goswami was actually needed, right now. He didn't do any wrong.Arban Goswami is probably India's most stunning TV journalist, after Karan Thapar. His words can sting and unleash a fury, which destroys his opponent. When in his full rage, no one can stand against him. For a long time, I idolized him.

But then, came the lure of capital and power, and he started abusing his reach and impact.

When Rohith Vemula committed suicide in 2016, the initial few shows which Arnab did was absolutely fascinating. Pinning down the college officials and the local political leaders who led to his unfortunate suicide, he demolishd them on live TV, demanding from the Govt what everyone wanted: Justice.

Within 12 months, under allegedly Govt pressure, this whole narrative dramatically shifted, and in a cheap, disgusting move, Arnab kept on hammering the caste angle, somehow trying to prove that being a dalit had no role in Rohith's suicide.

This was a shameless twist of greed and immorality by Arnab, and this was the reason why Kunal Kamra created this drama in flight. He is not a fool to take panga against entire Govt machinary, neither an attention seeking pseudo liberal.

He questioned the ethics and morality of being a journalist, and I see absolutely no wrong in that.

When the ears of the establishment and crony media gets jammed with corruption, an explosion is required.

And the very fact that four of the biggest airlines have banned a standup comedian, violating DGCA rules, clearly proves that what Kunal did was needed.",1580358150.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,78,423

Since most chemical guys from my college and other similar institutes go for either IT or finance/operations(essentially MBA) given the lack of well paying core chemical jobs, I have decided to pursue IT too. I'm getting started with Data structures and Algorithms and would do a couple other courses too. So far so good.

&#x200B;

My real question arises looking at the long term picture of IT/data science industry. Most good companies I'm aware of have a median working age group of 23-35. **What do people do after the age of let's say, 40 in IT?** Personally, I haven't seen any old men/women working as coders/managers(unless they have a strong skill-set for a managerial background).

&#x200B;

Also, the way some of my seniors (and their seniors) are getting paid right now(many of them upward of Rs 2 lakh/month in just about 5 years of experience), don't you think it would be easier for the company(in a few years) to pay peanuts to freshers and let go off the high-paid individuals?

&#x200B;

I still haven't made up my mind about my career so now would be a right time to light the candle.

&#x200B;

874,"What’re the ramifications of the CAA for an Indian not born in India (NRI)?Hello everyone,

I received a call from a family friend who works in the court as a lawyer in Punjab. I’m not sure what to make of it because I chuckled at what he was saying but also didn’t want to completely dismiss his claims since this is India after all. 

I’m an Indian born and brought up in Dubai, UAE. I have my birth certificate as proof. I’ve never stayed in India for a long duration of time, mostly visiting just for my vacations. 

My parents are Indian and born in Punjab. My father ran his own business in Dubai from 1978-2014, after which he retired and moved back to India. 

I recently quit my job in Dubai in October, 2019 and I’ve been living in India since. My only proof is my passport. I’ve recently applied for my Aadhaar Card and I’ve been informed that the number has been generated, which means I should have it soon. I’m 30 years old and have been an Indian citizen since birth. I’ve just been living here and not really doing anything. Things were very hectic in Dubai so I’m just taking some time off till I find another job in Dubai or elsewhere. 

The UAE, being a constitutional monarchy, doesn’t allow for naturalization as you all may already know so I never got offered Emirati citizenship. 

Now, moving on to my family friend’s phone call - he informed me that starting April, 2020, no documents will be considered as proof of citizenship, be it passport or Aadhaar Card. The government will introduce a Citizenship Card which will be given to people who’re born in India only. Once that Citizenship Card is issued, that’s when the passport will be considered as proof of identification. 

He has informed me that since I’m not born here, nor have I ever lived here for an extended period of time, the government will consider me an illegal alien and send me to a detention center for an indefinite period. I live in Gurgaon and he informed me that this is where start implementing this rule first. He said that every individual is responsible for themselves. Doesn’t matter if their parents are Indians. He has advised me to leave the country as soon as possible and not wait till April, 2020. 

Personally, I find this to be a bit ludicrous. How can they just strip away my nationality and send me to a detention center (which seems a bit farfetched) if I’ve been an Indian National my entire life? I don’t like to bring up religion but I’m Sikh, since a lot of what’s going on with the CAA revolves around the individual’s religion.

https://preview.redd.it/an8w4ihqzwd41.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fe9aea75466467007514df7ad0bf705afc2c398

### Tl;dr

Foundation for Media Professionals (FMP) sent a representation to the Government of Jammu & Kashmir demanding compliance with the guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India.* FMP was an intervenor in the case, and its representation criticises the whitelisting regime of internet censorship currently prevailing in Jammu & Kashmir for being unconstitutional and technically infeasible. In addition to this, FMP has also sought disclosure of all past orders and recommendations of the Review Committee.

### Status of Restrictions

After the Supreme Court delivered its judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* on 10 January, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir has partially restored internet access through multiple orders. Through the order issued on 24 January, only 2G internet access has been provided to the residents of Jammu and Kashmir to access 301 whitelisted websites while millions of other websites remain blocked. Notably, websites of political parties and social media platforms continue to remain blocked in Jammu and Kashmir. 

### Whitelisting is Unconstitutional

A whitelisting regime of internet censorship is unconstitutional because it inverses the constitutional design of fundamental rights being the norm and restrictions being the exception. For these reasons, Section 69A, IT Act 2000 empowers the government to block access to websites hosting illegal content after following proper procedure. However, until such websites are specifically identified and blocked after following the prescribed procedure, the default position is that all websites remain accessible. If the Government is concerned about misinformation and incitement of violence, it may selectively blacklist websites which contain illegal content but it cannot impose a generic ban on all websites and selectively whitelist certain websites. 

By inverting the basic logic underpinning our Constitution, whitelisting makes arbitrary state action inevitable. Since government officials do not have to apply their mind before blocking access to a specific website, many websites are not whitelisted merely because government officials are not aware of them. There is also no explanation provided regarding why certain websites remain blocked while other websites belonging to the same category are whitelisted.

### Whitelisting is Technically Infeasible

In the last week, there has been some [**excellent analysis**](https://www.medianama.com/2020/01/223-analysis-of-whitelisted-urls-in-jammu-and-kashmir-how-usable-are-they/) by Rohini Lakshane, Prateek Waghmare and others on why a whitelisting regime of censorship is not technically feasible owing to the interconnected nature of the internet. Drawing on this research, the representation highlights that 301 websites which have been whitelisted by the government will be fully functional only if the web application is permitted to make network calls to other websites to load JavaScript, style sheets, maps, videos, images, analytics etc. For instance, having access to an e-commerce platform like Amazon is meaningless unless the customer is also able to see images of the product that he/she wants to buy. Further, in many cases, while the website’s main domain has been whitelisted, its subdomains which contain the log in page or other important features remain blocked. Therefore, a large number of these 301 websites are not practically usable for the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. 

### No Disclosure of Past Orders

In its judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India*, the Supreme Court has held that the government must proactively publish all orders issued under Section 144, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017. The Supreme Court has also clarified that the government cannot cite administrative inconvenience to refuse publication of orders. However, despite this explicit direction, the Government of Jammu & Kashmir has not published past orders issued between 05 August 2019 to 14 January 2020 on its website or any publically accessible forum. 

### No Disclosure of Review Committee Recommendations

The Supreme Court has mandatorily directed the Review Committee constituted under the Temporary Telecom Suspension Rules, 2017 to periodically review the need for suspension of telecommunication services every seven working days. However, there is no information available in the public domain about whether the Review Committee has complied with this direction and what recommendations were made by the Review Committee, if any.

Lawyers retained by IFF represented FMP before the Supreme Court and provided drafting assistance for this representation. We will continue supporting individuals and organizations seeking restoration of internet services in Jammu and Kashmir and all across India.

When I graduated, I started working for a startup off-campus and left abruptly because of the pay and the work. It was really hard for me to get a job after that. I started preparing for civil services because I thought I had it to study more and crack it. In terms of knowledge, I have really gained a lot but couldn't clear it in two attempts. I lost hope and moved back home and started applying for jobs again. I've a good knowledge in digital marketing as the start-up I joined was related to that. I've learned Excel and SQL as most of the position these days require it.

I got selected for interviews but it was really hard for me to get a response on the result as most of the company didn't respond after the interviews. I seem to be doing good at the interviews, I mean I answer everything well, but still I am not getting the offer. What could be the reason? I've very honest about the gap that I've in my resume.

All i need to book a flight is Name, Email and Phone No.

Name is too generic. I have 25 'Ashish Sharma' in my office. Email and phone no. are easily changed.

So how would they track next time the person comes back? 

Solutions that I have considered:

1. They track you by the ID that you gave while boarding the flight on which you were banned. Problem: Next time you could give another ID.
2. The Airline get all your details from government of all the IDs that have been issued to you. Problem: You can get multiple Voter IDs made in India. Probably even Driving Licenses.
3. Facial Recognition is not matured enough. 

Hopefully the answer is pretty simple and I might be overlooking it. Yet, i cant think of a foolproof way(from airline perspective) with which you can enforce a no fly zone. The government/airline might have some way of doing this inefficiently/ineffectively, I am looking for the perfect solution with the current constrains.

I am planning to buy a bicycle within 15k.
However roaming around almost all the bicycle shops in Kolkata, from local shops to high end cycle boutique shops (these exists!), I am very much confused on the brand and type of cycle i should consider. Well i am hoping all the fellow cyclists of my country can help me decide on which one to pick. My height is 6feet and my cycle requirement goes as:

Wheel: 29inch

Frame: Light and should be easy to carry up & down to 3rd  floor by stairs

Gear: Yes (front and rear both)

Brakes: No preference, should be strong enough

Purpose: Daily morning cycling to keep me fit and occasionally weekend rides.

Place of ride: Asphalt road with small, medium and big pot holes (potholes = off-roading in city)

Maximum budget: ₹15000

Well visiting almost all the shops, what brands i shortlisted are Xbicycle, Trinx, Firefox, Montra (do not remember the exact models of these brands). However almost all the forums and blogs are like big NO NO to Firefox (but I liked their cycles!!).
All the brands claim that their cycles are 100% imported and are 200% better than Indian brands. And trust me there is a hell lot of competative marketing going on here!

I am trying hard to decide which on to take but utterly confused here, getting Nightmares of cycles :\

*As children we are taught the great doings of our nation, for how humanitarian it is, how peaceful it is, how it loves and accepts everyone.*


*As children we are taught to be the image of a secular and progressive India that would have made our forefathers proud.*


*But perhaps I fell sick the day when we were taught to never criticize it.*


*Perhaps the teacher went missing the day when we were to be taught to never oppose.* 





Certainly the teaching was wrong that all Indians are my brothers and sisters. The shallow waters that I trenched were far from the barren terrain of my country. 
Certainly the teachings of harmony were all wrong. 


Surely the waters were too shallow for I couldn't see how dark they were. 



It pains me to know that the ideals we are taught are all too bright and not fit for the grim world.

I blew it off but little did I know it wasn't the torch of destruction but of light. It was to be the fire that would envelop the blinding hatred and clear away the darkness. But no good are these regrets when the torch is dead and so is the fire. 



Yet I still did fear. I feared the day of judgement, not of death, but of honesty. How would I answer, not to God, but to myself? 



But as ignorant I was, I walked away with no regret. 





Now as my eyes are adjusted to the darkness, I still see bright glimpses of the waters that I trenched as a child.

1063,"All about CyclesHello to my fellow indian cyclists.

I am planning to buy a bicycle within 15k.
However roaming around almost all the bicycle shops in my city Kolkata, from local shops to high end cycle boutique shops (these exists!), I am very much confused on the brand and type of cycle i should consider. Well i am hoping all the fellow cyclists of my country can help me decide on which one to pick. My height is 6feet and my cycle requirement goes as:

Wheel: 29inch

Frame: Light and should be easy to carry up & down to 3rd  floor by stairs

Gear: Yes (front and rear both)

Brakes: No preference, should be strong enough

Purpose: Daily morning cycling to keep me fit and occasionally weekend rides.

Place of ride: Asphalt road with small, medium and big pot holes (potholes = off-roading in city)

Maximum budget: 15000INR

Well visiting almost all the shops, what brands i shortlisted are Xbicycle, Trinx, Firefox, Montra (do not remember the exact models of these brands). However almost all the forums and blogs are like big NO NO to Firefox (but I liked their cycles!!).
All the brands claim that their cycles are 100% imported and are 200% better than Indian brands. And trust me there is a hell lot of competative marketing going on here!

I am trying hard to decide which on to take but utterly confused here, getting Nightmares of cycles :\

Someone edited the following in Wikipedia Page of Jawaharlal Nehru.

Someone tried to malign the image of our first prime minister. Who is gonna benefit personally and politically? It's open for interpretation.

What's strange was IP address which edited the Wikipedia page was tracked to government-owned National Informatics Centre (NIC).

But, in the words of Pranesh Prakash, policy director at the Centre for Internet and Society: 

""It isn't clear as to who all have access to the NIC network, so it's difficult to pinpoint the exact person who did this"".

Was there any investigation done over the issue? Was it acceptable by the current Government that a govt employee is trying to severely damage the reputation of our first prime minister using Government's IP address? Did congress Party made big fuzz out of this and make sure the news reaches everyone and govt take some action?

Like, seriously,what's the point of starting an educational institute if you're gonna be using somebody else's sylabbus and rules.A person who wants to genuinely provide quality education will obviously start an institute which teaches according to the pattern he feels is good,i.e be autonomous, why'd he even think of asking for another institute to provide their sylabbus so that he can be under them and follow their set of rules and sylabbus.Sadly,there aren't many of these in India and a lot of them are just set up for the sake of it and run on the Indian mentality that engineering=self worth.The only reason they are  set up is for business,and that's what education has become, a huge business.This is Halting the development of our country and leading to a lot other problems too.
If you're a class 11 or 12 student reading this, please don't join any affiliated college.Do a thorough research before joining it,and if it's affiliated to one,please stay 10 feet away from it and ask your friends and relatives to do the same.I assure you, you'll be doing yourself and your country a great favour.Use your head,don't be sheep,like the education system has been trying to turn you into,so far.

My mother has been in the hospital for 15 day because of serious fracture in her knees and some other stuff below that. Being the only attendant and under a lot of stress from other factors, he forgot to take his blood pressure medicine and suffered a brain hemorrhage. He passed away yesterday. My sister and I haven't broken the news to my sister yet. He was a DCIO(DSP equivalent) in the Intelligence Bereau two months away from his retirement.

Right now, I want to know all the affairs I need to take care of. Financial such as Insurance and Bank accounts these are literally the only two things I can think of right now. Any help is much appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks everybody, I really appreciate all the kind words. I just got done with the final rites. I don't know what's going on in my head right. I feel like I'm constantly swinging between denial and acceptance. My sister and I broke the news to our mother few hours ago. It took a while for the news to settle in. She just said, 'He left so much unfinished'.

I'm in a slight dilemma right now. My father's Aadhar card has as permanent address, a place we don't live or have any contact with anymore. But I gave the same address at the hospital. Going forward, is that going to be an issue?

Along with his normal pension he also had an NPS account. I have no idea about the protocol surrounding the management of it in a situation like this. 

Also, someone mentioned that I might be eligible for compassionate appointment, does anyone have any idea regarding that. I never considered a govt. job but I probably won't be able complete my degree as things stand now.

I am 25 year old male. When i was in college i was the happiest i have ever been. I had amazing friends. Amazing college life. We used to hangout every week. We didn't have anything against each other. So as time went on i was dealing with family problems. My mom and dad got separated as soon as i cleared my intermediate. I never imagined that i would be experiencing such thing in my life. From being a talkative and hyper active person i am now a very lazy guy who just wants to sit at home and do nothing. I went through depression and anxiety. And that's not all. Because of this i started losing friends. I did things which hurt them. One day at a party i touched my best friend inappropriately. She didn't say anything at that time. I texted her the next day and she said to not to talk to her ever again. We never talked after that. We had been good friends for over 6 years and i lost her just because of my silly mistake. Now she is shifting to another city next month so she threw a reunion party for all the friends from our college and i was the only one who wasn't invited. I felt really bad for myself and it's been a terrible day for me. Life has been hard for me for the past 4 years. I don't blame anyone but myself. I have lost all my friends. Except for my family i got 2-3 people whom i can call as friends. I have considered ending my life many times but whenever i think about suicide i think about my family and it stops me from ending it all. I am 25 now, I haven't cleared my intermediate.

On 8th September last year a relative told me that a girl he know is looking for a boy. Next day our families met and 3 days later the girls family called us for Roka on the next day. Ceremony happened and then in the morning the girl told me she is marrying me due to parental pressure and is not interested so I called it off.

1322,"Kunal Kamra singlehandedly showed India yesterday how to talk to enablers of fascism. Some lessons from the incident for a deluded democracy.This is going to be short. What Kunal Kamra did yesterday is PRECISELY what India needs to learn to do more: to talk DOWN to fascist scum, to SHAME them, to DEMOLISH their sense of impunity and to let them know that their actions WILL have consequences. 

And KK did all of that without violence, without abuse and without infringing on anyone's rights, which you could rightly argue is more democratic treatment than fascists, of all people, deserve. 

And here's the thing that India's incurably deluded and dangerous liberals and centrists need to understand - you don't defeat fascists by being nice or silent or courteous. 

While we're at that, here's a quick guide on how to spot liberal insanity - 

Scenario I: A flight full of people lose their calm for 2 minutes. 

Scenario II: 200 million people lose their dignity and rights in their own nation, facing impending persecution. 

To the liberal, the former is as serious a crisis, if not greater, as the latter. And THAT is how you know just how dangerous they are. 

If you're going to be 'nice' to a Nazi, you ARE a fucking Nazi yourself, although just a few rungs down on the same ladder. 

You either fight Nazis or you become one. Make your fucking choice now.",1580289383.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,114,620

1347,"Rohith Vemula's Suicide Note [2016] NSFWI  would not be around when you read this letter. Don't get angry on me. I  know some of you truly cared for me, loved me and treated me very well.  I have no complaints on anyone. It was always with myself I had problems. I feel a growing gap between my soul and my body. And I have become a monster. I always wanted to be a writer. A writer of science,  like Carl Sagan. At last, this is the only letter I am getting to write.

I  loved science, stars, nature, but then I loved people without knowing that people have long since divorced from nature. Our feelings are second handed. Our love is constructed. Our beliefs colored. Our originality valid through artificial art. It has become truly difficult to love without getting hurt.The value of a  man was reduced to his immediate identity and nearest possibility. To a  vote. To a number. To a thing. Never was a man treated as a mind. As a  glorious thing made up of stardust. In very field, in studies, in streets, in politics, and in dying and living.I am writing this kind of letter for the first time. My first time of a final letter. Forgive me if I fail to make sense.

Maybe I was wrong, all the while, in understanding the world. In understanding love, pain, life, death. There was no urgency. But I always was rushing. Desperate to start a life. All the while, some people, for them, life itself is a curse. My birth is my fatal accident. I can never recover from my childhood loneliness. The unappreciated child from my past.I am not hurt at this moment. I am not sad. I am just empty. Unconcerned about myself. That's pathetic. And that's why I am doing this.

People may dub me as a coward. And selfish, or stupid once I am gone. I am not bothered  about what I am called. I don't believe in after-death stories, ghosts,  or spirits. If there is anything at all I believe, I believe that I can travel to the stars. And know about the other worlds.

If you, who is reading this letter can do anything for me, I have to get seven months of my fellowship, one lakh and seventy-five thousand rupees. Please see to it that my family is paid for  that. I have to give some 40 thousand to Ramji. He never asked them back. But please pay that to him from that.Let my funeral be silent and smooth. Behave like I just appeared and gone. Do not shed tears for me. Know that I am happy dead than being alive.""From shadows to the stars.""

Uma anna, sorry for using your room for this thing.To ASA family, sorry for disappointing all of you. You loved me very much. I wish all the very best for the future.For one last time,

Jai BheemI forgot to write the formalities. No one is responsible for my this act of killing myself.

No one has instigated me, whether by their acts or by their words to this act.This is my decision and I am the only one responsible for this.

1419,"What are we doing parents, teachers and tutors?So I am an independent education consultant from India - who has worked with kids in gaining admissions to top colleges in the US (Cornell, Brown, UPenn), Canada (McGill, Toronto, UBC), and UK (Imperial, Cambridge, Warwick). The past three years that I have spent doing this has brought me closer to the realities of teenhood in modern India. I have become increasingly disillusioned by the number of expectations we have from the young ones! I struggle to schedule calls and meetings with high school students because their schedules are so busy! I have even had calls at midnight in some cases as that's the only time the kid could find.

I am not even sure where this spiral is leading to? The kids are coached at every stage and even overcoached with tuitions starting as early as second grade and parents fretting about if their 4 years old can code?! As someone who grew up in the 90s in India - with a reasonable level of education pressure at the hands of the Indian education system - I sometimes wish I could put a pause on this madness and let the kids be! We have a generation that doesn't know the respite of the languid summer days, the hours spent in a limited screen environment just mucking about the house making scrapbooks, getting dirty or doing whatever the hell WE wanted. Now I know I am going down the rose-tinted glasses route - but as kid boredom leads to discovery. The afternoon I spent going door to door in our building trying to sell peanuts that I found in the house (to the utter embarrassment of my middle-class service job parents) taught me things, the time I spent trying to teach my brother math just because he was a ready audience meant something. What did that have to do with going abroad at 17 for me? NOTHING! But they are the fondest memories that continue to affect my well being even decades later.

A key part of me working with kids is exploring their dreams and aspirations when it comes to going to college abroad and when I start throwing around words like dreams and aspirations and interests I am very often met with silent stares or rehearsed answers that they seem to have heard from their parents at a dinner party. We have all seen the ads for tuition centres that promise superior coaching by IIT alumni or the mind-boggling number of apps that are literally in our faces all the time. The coding academy, the robotics classes, the tuitions for the school tuition, the study abroad fairs with ""direct"" admissions, the new swanky IB school, the freaking fingerprint career aptitude test (yep you heard it right) ... spiralling into a multi-billion dollar industry that profits off the parental anxieties. I have been part of it ... and I don't think I want to be at least till I think this more.

But, now I am closer to saying ""rehne do!"" or ""let them be!"" But then we add in the element of international admissions and we can't ""rehne do!"" So I think in India we love us some formulas - with parents that are a direct result of formulaic learning themselves when we look at international education preparation we just work better with equations. This much social service, this much coding, this much school activities, this much SAT etc etc etc. We approach the SAT like we approach the JEE. With the idea to ""Crack it!"" whatever that means. We put our kids in IB curriculum which is individualistic and intensive, at schools which promise the best teachers - yet send our kids lugging round to tuitions. I mean if I need tuitions after paying Rs 10,00,000 + in fees - what am I paying for?! Then there are those resume-building activities - the internships that you source from a friend of a friend, the certificates from causes and NGOs that magically appear and that the kids feign enthusiasm for in their essays. I think the study abroad aspirations hit our shores like the cyclone hitting Rameshwaram. And in the winds, it is the teens who were swept up.

I speak from the Indian perspective but if the ""success"" of varsity blues scandal in the US, or the rise of Asian tiger mom ideology is anything to go by the issue seems like an international educational challenge that we aren't talking about enough. I get it that we want our kids to study in the best colleges if we are paying millions of dollars converted from our Indian incomes - but I feel like there is a better way for us to approach this. I would like to hear your opinions as I continue finding my own way through this chaos. Let's talk people!",1580289155.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,10

India above everything is a democracy. But the ruling government has turned it into a revenge saga where every voice against it is seditioned.  

Any reason that goes in favour of government is strictly supporting suppression. 

A law is a law. Let CAA be implemented. Let NPR  be implemented but snatching a citizens right to protest, labelling them against the interest of nation, how can that be justified? 

The governments outreach program is aimed to gain support of like minded people and not pacify the dissenting citizens. 

There’s a reason Hon’ble is prefixed against union ministers and they are just ganging up now?
As if the GOVERNMENT will reward them for hate speech. The more the better, is that how those union minister works now? 

I am not here to change someones POV, I’m simply anguished that the democratically elect government is acting like the communist china in many aspects now. 

Also the Rise of BJP has shown me how weak and stupid most of the opposition parties are.

How do you look at Jharkhand being an accommodating place throughout the year? A cheap travel package that will provide much of forest and rural serenity, accompanied by a dip in the local culture. It will also be about learning new skills, getting in touch with the rural spaces that everyone is leaving with the vices of the city.

As travelers, you will find a reasonable cost that will include local experiences, great food, cats, warm and crisp sheets, freshwater, and a lot of space.

I'm curious what would be a good way to do a trial run in the country.  Some questions I have are:

&#x200B;

* Would it be best to pick one particular region or city to focus on at first?  If so, which would you suggest?
* Would it be best to sell via e-commerce, or try to work with someone to distribute through more traditional channels?
* If I were to set up a primary distribution hub where I'd package, press into tablets, etc, where would be best?  Take into consideration accessibility to a sea port
* What else should I take into consideration that is noteworthy

1563,"Indian employment sucks and I can’t blame the governmentTo start off, I don’t have a graduation and I’m currently pursuing through distance education. I have worked in few fields but they suck(recruiting, call center etc) so I took up python, learnt it and then moved to Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. I’m not an expert but I can make basic websites and can create intermediate level projects with python. 

I’ve started looking for a job as a fresher or a trainee, been applying for a while but no luck. First thing is recruiters try to get me into recruiting or call center field even though I have clearly mentioned that I am looking for a job in web/software development. It kinda feels like they are trying to drag me down to the same place from where I left because what other jobs will I get for 12th pass?!

Second, I get no calls for interviews for the programming jobs that I apply and when I try to reach the recruiter, they say I’m not qualified enough to be a programmer because I don’t have a graduation. 

Indian companies hire people on based on their qualification. It doesn’t matter if you have a bachelors in Hindi or French which are completely irrelevant to programming but a degree is must. There are so many jobs out there but only for the ‘educated’ ones. Your skill doesn’t matter, your knowledge doesn’t matter, your commitment doesn’t matter. I can code better than my friends but guess what they got jobs because they have a damn graduation.

This really sucks and it’s the mentality that education makes you better in everything that sucks even more. Now I don’t think I can blame the government for employment crisis because it’s not just them fucking things up for the younger generation, it’s everyone! I’m not even sure what to do, I’m 24 and I stay at home and it sucks that I’m loosing hope and that I’m being dragged to the same shit hole from where I’m trying to climb out of.

1613,"124th Constitution Amendment Bill : 10% reservation for ""financially poor"". An anti-poor, exclusive reservation for few of the upper-castes[The Wire](https://thewire.in/government/ews-quota-consultation-law-ministry)

[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lok-sabha-clears-124-constitution-amendment-bill-to-give-quota-for-general-category/articleshow/67441684.cms?from=mdr)

 The reservation is for 'Financial-poor' of the following communities in the 'job and education  :

>The major castes to benefit from the proposed law are **Brahmins, Rajputs (Thakurs), Jats, Marathas, Bhumihars, several trading castes, Kapus and Kammas among other upper castes.**


* Deception in name : They are calling it reservation for 'financially poor' whereas it is all about the benefit of upper caste against rest of the population.

If it is for 'financially poor' than why include caste on first place? make it for all of the poor of the country.

* Exclusion of dalits & ""Creamy layer"" in Sc/St reservation : BJP/RSS invented the term 'creamy layer' to further progress their oppression of dalits in a much more fundamental level such as constitution itself. 

The reservation is given to dalits to lift them out of their 'slave' status in society and the country, It has nothing to do with their 'Financial situation', If govt. is so worried about poorer dalits not getting benefits than they should make a separate reservation for poor-dalits based on their 'financial situation'  which is apart from their 'social status'  

The majority of poor people of the country belong to dalit community then why they are excluded from this new reservation for 'financially poor' ?

This new reservation defines poverty as having income of  less than 8 lakh rupees per year. The poverty line defined by indian govt. is 32 rupees per day or  Rs.11,680  per year. So on one hand govt./RSS/BJP is calling dalits who are benefiting from reservation but earn more than **Rs.32 per day as 'Creamy Layer'** whereas an upper caste who earns less than **Rs.2191 per day is considered as 'Poor'.**

On other hand only 15% of upper castes are poor (that percentage in dalits is 80% ).

*  The bill was rushed under 20 days without even having either proper discussion or exposure to public :

>from drawing board to law within a span of just 20 days.
Not only this – instead of getting cabinet approval for amendments in the office memorandum of the Bill,  Narendra Modi made use of a special privilege the prime minister has under government rules of business while the Union minister for social justice approved the cabinet note over the phone. In addition, on the request of the latter’s ministry, **the Lok Sabha speaker gave special preference to the Bill and waived the conditional requirement of seven days to introduce it in parliament** , documents obtained by The Wire under the Right to Information Act have revealed.

Contrarily, govt. is still refusing to publish the population census which will tell us the new population percentage of dalits in india.

1616,"Thoughts on an American Pursuing a Masters at IIT?Hello. I have been contemplating this idea for a while now and seek this subreddit's opinion:

I am a 23 y/o American that is currently working full time at a big 4 consulting firm and is considering pursuing a masters at an IIT school. Admittedly, I have not looked much into the admissions process but believe that international students may have a slight edge when applying from talks with my coworkers.

I had the idea of applying here because I am currently working in cybersecurity and the most technical aspects of our job are often outsourced to graduates of IIT. I figured if I can harness some of the knowledge they have, I will be very valuable in the states. 

Please let me know of your opinions on this. I know the opportunity cost of not working at a big 4 firm for 2 years to pursue this degree is easily $140k+, and I also realize that living conditions are a lot different in India.",1580252718.0,,,dark,8,10

1621,"Today, Social Justice died again in India!Ok here is a deeply distrubing story,

14 people were convincted for Sardarpur Village Massacre [2002 post Godra riots] in which 33 muslims were burnt alive. 
They were sentenced to serve life in prison till death.

Now the supreme court [CJI] granted bail to all of them on condition that they should shift to neighbouring state Madhya Pradesh. They have to do social and spiritual service. 

A Supreme Court bench led by Chief Justice SA Bobde asked the Madhya Pradesh administration to find them work .


So currently in India,

If anyone kill muslims [ read minority], even if they are found guilty of doing so, they'll be released in name of  'social and spiritual service' [Even Nityananda was doing spiritual service] and given jobs also.

The biggest problem with this is, there is no absolute minority in any society. It changes as demographics changes. One day muslims are minorities another day sc/st s are and another day some caste.

*So social ustice died a slowed death today*

1674,"How we're losing the war against BJP by continuing to protest against CAA-NRCIf a totalitarian government wants to take over and carry out their agenda, then a bunch of peaceful college kids with provocative slogans aren’t going to impede it. When even the institutions designed to protect citizens from malevolence, even from a deranged government, is under threat of losing its autonomy, there’s not much we can do. 

The left falsely assumes that wide-spread protests will help curb the problem. They think that if only we become angry enough, and showed less apathy towards the persecuted, and demonize the other side, and deem the neutral observers to be part of the problem, we could unmount the government from its power. I think there’s little reason to believe this will work.

Telling people that they’re wrong and that they’re complicit in a genocide level atrocity while they were essentially uninterested in the issues, is a poor approach to changing minds. Keep in mind that changing people’s minds, and making them understand the scale and urgency of what’s going on, is our objective here. At the end of the day, BJP is running the show because the citizens decided, overwhelmingly, that it was a good idea. The only scenario where we win is if we effectively persuade millions of Indians, many of whom are living in eco-chambers, who’re bombarded with fake news and false narratives about a benign, hardworking, government, and many more who just don’t care because they have other things to worry about.

The protests that revolve around CAA-NRC are unjustified; when you look at the details, you’ll find that their entire positions are founded upon speculations of the government’s intentions, and not based on logical conclusions derived from the details of the bills. And the protests are shadowing the genuine problems with the govt; most recently, they conducted, unambiguously, a state-sponsored terrorist attack in one of India’s finest universities, the JNU. 

It’s important, and crucially so, that we are careful about accusing the government of the right reasons. When you club everything together, it becomes super easy for the other side to point out the hypocrisy, and dishonesty of the left, and use it to hold their voter base from wandering off to the other side. 

BJP probably wants communal disharmony, but it’s not the Hindu-muslim disharmony that’s of interest, it’s the BJP supporters-opposers disharmony. I’ve never seen the nation so polarised before. Conversations have essentially stopped between the two sides because both are convinced that the other one is beyond reason. And when conversation breaks down, the only thing left is violence. We really only have two modes — conversation and violence. So be careful not to escalate the aggression. Go easy on the nazi calling maybe. 

From the right’s perspective, they are seeing two bills which have no real problem with it, which are motivated by compassion towards our fellow non-muslims who’re severely persecuted in the hell hole of Pakistan, and the left is going berserk, and hypocritically they do not give two shits about the lives of these non-muslims. And however they look, they don’t find any evidence for their claims of only Muslims losing citizenship by the millions. The reaction in the entire country is a quintessential example of delusional mobs who don’t have any understanding of what they’re protesting about. Naturally, they distance themselves from the left even more and double down on their support for the nationalistic party with strong leadership. 

This is bad. This will guarantee BJP remaining in power for the next term as well. With the confidence that they won’t be dethroned anytime soon, they can peacefully and diligently work towards making India a Hindu Rashtra. ",1580224336.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,14,5

### Tl;dr

The WCD Ministry has approved use of the Nirbhaya Fund for large scale installation of CCTV cameras under the Safe City Project. However, empirical evidence suggests that CCTV cameras are not effective at preventing violence against women, and without any guidelines governing their operation, these cameras will be used against women for voyeurism and moral policing. The fundamental right to privacy exists even in public spaces, and therefore, any use of video surveillance should be within a proper legislative framework with adequate safeguards, and it should be preceded by privacy impact assessments and followed by post ante audits to assess effectiveness.

### Background

The Women and Child Development Ministry (WCD Ministry) has recommended that Rs. 2919.55 crores from the Nirbhaya Fund should be used for the  Safe City Project proposedby the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA). Large scale video surveillance through CCTV cameras is a crucial component of the Safe City Project. While the objective of the Nirbhaya Fund and the Safe City Project is ensuring safety of women, mass installation of CCTV cameras will not serve this purpose. 

### The Problem is Bigger than Stranger Danger

We must remember that the vast majority of sexual violence and domestic violence in India happens within the confines of the home, and not in public places. For instance, according to NCRB data from 2016, 94.6% of rapes in India are committed by perpetrators known to the victim such as family members, friends or acquaintances. Therefore, installation of CCTV cameras in public places by itself will have a minimal impact on prevention and investigation of violence against women. 

### Are CCTV Cameras Effective?

Even when violence against women is perpetrated by strangers in public spaces, there is little evidence that CCTV cameras will be effective at preventing such crimes. In 2008, a systematic review of 44 studies from 5 countries on the effectiveness of CCTV systems concluded CCTV cameras have a modest effect on personal property crime but they did not reduce violent crime. Other empirical studies also suggest that mass video surveillance may not a suitable method to prevent violence against women and other solutions such as increased street lighting maybe more effective. 

### Pan-Tilt-Zoom into Women’s Private Lives

Unless there are strict guidelines and safeguards to prevent misuse of CCTV cameras, the video surveillance infrastructure established under the Safety City Project could become a tool for voyeurism, extortion, stalking and harassment of women. The risk of such misuse is especially higher if footage from CCTV cameras is shared with private individuals and organizations like Resident Welfare Associations.

Empirical studies have found that 10% of all targeted surveillance on women and 15% of operator-initiated surveillance on women is for voyeuristic reasons. In addition to this, there are several real life examples of CCTV cameras facilitating voyeurism, and targets have included even prominent political leaders such as the WCD Minister, Mrs. Smriti Irani and the German Chancellor, Ms. Angela Merkel. 

### Another Type of Creep We Should Worry About

Since large scale installation of CCTV cameras under the Safe City Project lacks any governing legislative framework, it is highly vulnerable to function creep with advancement in facial recognition and gait analysis technologies.  Footage from CCTV cameras could also be used as training data for facial recognition and gait analysis systems without the knowledge and consent of ordinary law abiding citizens featured in the footage.

### Need for Evidence Based Rights Respecting Policy

In light of the above mentioned concerns, we have urged the WCD Ministry to reconsider its decision to invest massive resources in large scale video surveillance projects and consider supporting alternatives such as street lighting, better civic amenities for women, counselling facilities, gender sensitisation in educational institutions etc. 

After balancing the likely harms, if installation of CCTV cameras is still deemed necessary in specific areas, it must be done within a proper statutory framework for data protection which includes guidelines for video surveillance. Further, it should be preceded by privacy impact assessments and followed up with post ante audits to review effectiveness.

1827,"10th grade student here. I'm terribly confused about what career path I should take. Need some questions answered. (Long Post)**Background:** I'm highly interested in programming (Been learning for almost 2 years now) and want to pursue a job in the CS sector (software developer and all) but I didn't take Science cause I didn't want to fail/just pass in 11th and 12th (cause I'm horrible at Science lol) so I took Commerce with Computer Science as optional. I don't really know if pursuing a career in computer science is possible with commerce so I have management as backup and also I'm potentially looking to pursue a career in both CS and Management (I feel like that's better? idk but I really want to do both welp )

So I already have a few degree combinations in mind but I'm confused about what to pursue:

1. **BBA + MBA (5 years)** (*this is a just in case degree, cause I dunno how good BCA+MCA is. If I find out doing BCA + MCA is not worth it then I guess I'll go for this.)*
2. **BCA + MBA (5 years)**
3. **BCA + MCA (5 years)** *(Integrated)*
4. **BCA + MCA (3 years + 3 years)** *(So I can do MCA from NIT, DU and other good universities.)*
5. **(BCA + MCA) + MBA (5 - 6 years + 2 years)**

* This is my backup plan btw cause my original plan is to pursue both my UG and PG abroad (provided I get decent scholarship, I posted regarding that in this sub - reddit a few days back).
* In case I can't do that my next plan is to do my UG here and my PG abroad.
* Somehow if even that doesn't work somehow my last plan is to do my PG here too and try to work in a MNC so I can possibly do my job abroad.
* If you are wondering by now what's my fascination with going abroad is, its just its always been my dream since childhood and I really want to accomplish this dream.

I'm sorry if all this sounds too much for a 15 year old! (about to give 10th boards) I just like to plan things in advance welp.

Obviously, I know its not too good to spend this many years doing degrees and that work experience is more important in the CS sector. So I have a 2 questions (and possibly more in the comments depending on what answers I receive here) which I need answered:

1. Are there any other degrees/degree combinations which are better than the ones I have listed? What's the scope of this degree combination in the long run? Can I expect higher salaries (at least 20k - 30k per month as a fresher) in it?
2. From the above list, which degree combination should I pursue? Is it good in the long run? Can I expect higher salaries (at least 20k - 30k per month as a fresher) in it? (provided I work hard enough and I'm willing to learn new things, yes I know that and I'm willing to do that!)

Sorry for the long post! But I'm really confused. Also posted this in r/Indian_Academia but got no response so I posted it here too.

1828,"How BJP IT cell is tackling informative videosI understand the situation, hope is lost in people of india. BJP has successfully managed to brainwash majority. But lets at least **try** to fight it.

**#1. They showcase CAB and NRC in different videos.**

One thing I notice in BJP IT cell's spread video, is that they address CAB and NRC in separate videos. Arguments with friends, they feel CAB in itself is not a problem. Same for NRC. But we all know the truth, CAB+NRC is the reason we are on roads. It will make a **bit** of sense to bhakts who actualy believe cab and nrc wont affect muslims if both are discussed together (or maybe not,cz bhakts).

**#2. They make a counter analysis videos of our analysis videos, but a bit distorted**

Kanhaiya made a video on CAB + NRC, they made a counter analysis which is full of bs. They do this for every video that actually shows the truth and add bs as analysis.

**#3. They use catchy headlines that actually brainwash these idiot bhakts**

Remember the ""maine apko jawab de dia hai"" guy? The video which is an eye opener for any sensible person ? The video is being spread as ""**NDTV journalist trying to put words into BJP ministers mouth""** or something like that. and I read the comments on it, they were so fucking stupid my IQ lowered. They were applauding the guy for keeping quiet and not letting NDTV guy 'put words' in his mouth. Some of them even cheering that such journalist should not be allowed anywhere near leaders.

I've moved to India since November 2019 to live closer to my family. And since the beginning of January I've been applying for analyst level positions in Bangalore, but no luck so far. Currently, I've put Chandigarh as my address and I'm kind of worried that as a result of that I might not be getting call backs or anything.

Is there some sort of bias with HR and recruiters that they'd consider locals nearby first - before anyone from elsewhere? I've also seen quite a few 'walk in interviews' happening for these analyst positions. Frankly I'm surprised about that because it feels like I'm not applying for a business/data analyst position but instead a  telecom executive position.

So my question is does it make sense to just head out to Bangalore and live in the city while I apply? (Atm I'm unemployed) To be frank, money isn't that big of a concern. I have some savings and would move into a PG until I get a job. 

Or should I ride it out and keep applying from home?",1580177505.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,28,40

It operates at 100.5, and is not broadcasting 24x7, there's no pattern to it either. I last heard it on 24th, and then it just popped up today. I'm in Gurgaon, and the reception is poorer than other stations in general.

It plays music that I really enjoy. Mostly Eagles, Eric Clapton, Gin Blossoms, Jennifer Rush, Jethro Till, Ozzy Osbourne, Interpol... Which is new because I haven't come across any FM station that exclusively plays stuff like this. And they don't censor the F-word!

There is no RJ, has occassional government scheme ads, and some ads about Delhi state elections. Only one private ad that runs way too often about hdradio but that's it.

It could be someone operating it unofficially. There was briefly an ad about 2019 Lok Sabha elections, it could be a recording that's playing. Or radio waves from the past bouncing around, I've (possibly) found a ghost station :p

Reddittors have been awesome at helping find such information, so I'm trying my hand here. Please please help me find out more about this - who runs it, what is it called, when does it run, etc.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Solved: It's a test station. I went to a different part of town where the signal was much stronger.

1926,"My experience at Anti CAA-NRC protest in San Francisco outside Indian consulate<throwaway account>    


So a protest was organized in San Francisco outside the Indian Consulate on 26th January against CAA,NRC and NPR. More than 400 people showed up but to our surprise the consulate was ready for protestors. They had made a small area with barricades around their building and hosted 25-30 people with pro-CAA placards. The people who were called by the consulate were highly abusive and provocative. The placards they were holding had words like ch\*\*tiya, pigs, calling us terrorists etc. They were also given a sound system to undermine our voices. It just broke my heart to see that these consulate people stooped to such low level.

These people would occasionally come out and enter anti CAA protestors and shouted Jai Shree Ram and hurled slurs at muslim people, called everyone Pakistani and went back to consulate premises.

Here's the link to some of the pictures.

As you can see (especially in the last picture) the well built premises inside the consulate hosting abusive people.

By the very rudimentary research I have done on the history of Islam and the subcontinent's history I find Tarek's views and my views to be quite similar. His weaving of the progress of Islam in the subcontinent with the political events are hard to ignore. Where him and I are in disagreement with are his political solutions. He gives outlandish political solutions and that is where he loses his audience. 

My question to people who are well versed with the history of Islam, not the practices but the political history of Islam, is, do you agree with his critique of the Indian Muslims, his misgivings about Islam practiced by the Arabs and if not, could you explain your misgivings or point me towards places where I could get a contrarian viewpoint.

I heard a story the other day. It was presented as an anecdote from real life, although not from the speaker's own experience. I was just wondering how plausible it is.

Apparently, Indian communities in the diaspora continue to follow their caste behavioural guidelines. Not everybody does that, and not to the same extent as in India, but the caste delineations still influence behaviour in the workplaces where there are large numbers of employees of Indian origin. 

A particular example quoted as an illustration was of an IT company in the US, where a recruiter couldn't reject an applicant for a job, in spite of the fact that the applicant was underqualified for it. Both were of Indian origin. The applicant was higher in the caste hierarchy than the recruiter, and the recruiter was afraid of being ostracised in his community for improper behaviour. 

I'm wondering whether this sounds to you as a hypothetically possible scenario, or if it's totally made-up nonsense? 

Any other observations/comments on the influence of the caste system on the social interactions in Indian diaspora communities are very welcome too. 

There's no hidden agenda behind this question. I'm just really interested in the social and psychological aspects of immigration, so you might say this question is powered by my curiosity :)

2000,"Corruption in the traffic department despite digitalization of challan-payment On 16th January, I accidentally jumped a red light, and was caught and had my driving license impounded. My case was sent to the virtual court, and I paid a fine of Rs. 1000/-, and had a release order from the court to get my license back.

I went to the Hauz Khaz Traffic Circle, where my license was, with the documents. There were quite a few people who had as well come to get their impounded DL/RC. The officer in the room collected the papers and came back after some time with the impounded docs. Even after two such rounds after giving the papers, I didn't get my license.

I went inside the room and asked the officer to find my DL, which he did. But refused to hand it over to me, and asked to attend some traffic class in Todapur, and then come back. His tone suggested malice.

I went out of the room and talked to my mother (who is a lawyer) and a friend who is studying law. They told me that I have release orders from the court, and don't have to attend any such classes which the officer said.

I went straight back into the room and started arguing with the officer, who threatened to suspend my license for 3 months. He said that he isn't asking for any bribe (FIRST SIGNAL) and that it is necessary to attend these classes after the Supreme Court of India made some judgement on the issue. I didn't back down and asked him to give it to me in writing that I yet have to attend the class before getting my DL back, or it is subject to suspension for 3 months.

I told him I study law (I lied), and that my parents are lawyers as well (which is true), and he cannot outsmart me. His arguments started getting weaker and weaker.

Just that moment, I got a call from my friend who I talked to earlier and I went out to talk. He said that he talked to some people and from their experience, it'd take quite some time to contest this in court and I should just go and attend the class and get my license back. I talked to some other people there, and they told me that it takes a lot of time to get in the class, and I should just hand Rs. 500/- to the canteen guy in the Todapur Traffic School and he'd get me the letter, which I can present to the officer.

I went inside to ask the closing time of the office, and this time there were two officers. The officer A (whom I argued with earlier) pointed at officer B (the new one) and told him that my parents are lawyers and I too study law. Hence went the conversation-  
*Officer A- This is the guy. His parents are lawyers and he studies law as well.*  
*Me- When is this office closing? I'll attend the class and come back.*  
*Officer A- Worry not! We'll help you straight away. This man (pointing at the new officer) will help you right now. Give me the documents.*  
*Me- I don't want to. Tell me the timings. I'd get back with the letter.*  
*Officer B- Don't worry. Let me see the documents.*  
*\*I handed the documents\**  
*Officer B to A- Don't mess with advocates! They can beat up the police too! They eat from the police and kick their asses too.*  
*Officer A- You're right.*  
*Me- But I am not even a lawyer yet. I am a student.*  
*Officer B- Haha, it's okay. You're a lawyer, your family is full of lawyers.*

Officer A started going through the files to get my DL and I signed the receiving, and I got my DL back.

**TL;DR- Officers tried asking for a bribe despite me having release order from the court. Being from a family of lawyers, he gave me my DL without any hassle.**",1580123256.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,3,6

I'm coming up to the end of my second trip to India now, and unfortunately, I'm flying out of Delhi, which to put it lightly, I'm not a big fan of. Since I've already been to Delhi and have seen most of the main sites/experienced the absolute chaos of Delhi, I'd like to stay somewhere a bit quieter this time to just relax a bit for the last few days of my trip (there won't really enough time for me to visit anywhere else that I haven't already been to).

Does anybody have any suggestions on areas to stay? I don't want it to be *too* quiet, but a nicer, comparatively cleaner/quieter area would be nice (last time, I stayed in alley not far from New Delhi train station, and that area was pretty damn filthy), preferably with a few cafes to chill out in and a perhaps a hostel to spend the nights in. Distance from the airport isn't really a big issue for me, but it'd be nice if the area was accessible by metro.

I would ask on /r/Delhi, but since I'm kind of bad-mouthing the city, I thought it might be best to ask here instead.

Thanks!",1580109594.0,,,dark,17,20

[Anti-CAA vs Pro CAA at DC](https://preview.redd.it/34pf2e1ribd41.png?width=2004&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca38dfe70fed345983596363a7922940cd5f67eb)

&#x200B;

The Republic Day celebrations in front of the Indian Embassy at Washington DC had all the colours of democracy. It started with the tribute to Mahatma Gandhi followed by the flag hoisting by chargé d'affaires. The crowd comprised of people from the diverse regions of India, with the diverse faith. A man with pro-CAA posters tried to gain attention by standing at the Embassy's entrance but was asked to put away his poster by the people already standing there.

The embassy had arranged an American band that started playing Indian songs and the patriotic fervour filled the place. They started with Iqbal's Saare Jahan Se Accha, followed by a lot of Daler Mehndi's songs. The Indian aunties captured the platform and started to shake on the beats. A saffron-clad gentleman tried to convert this function into a North Indian focused festival by using the mic to thank the band in Hindi after every song. The Telugus didn't find comfort in this show of strength. So some of them captured the mic and started thanking in Telgu. The Tamils followed. 

It was towards the end of this show that the Pro-Khalistan supporters showed up with their colourful turbans and yellow flags. Now there were around twenty of them challenging around 50 of the celebrators. The DC Police, sensing the prospect of discomfort among both side, decided to put a barrier in between the guest group and the celebrants. And then the sloganeering from both side begun. The show of flags and hands was a reminder of similar display at Wagah. The Indian authorities started playing the ""Joshila"" songs at this point to keep the Indian celebrators rejuvenated. It went on for about an hour when something unexpected happened. 

  


[All Indians vs Pro Khalistan Group](https://preview.redd.it/n8aigh3xibd41.png?width=1522&format=png&auto=webp&s=010825a60f5cc565a33946916a30119cb696f6fa)

A gathering of Anti-CAA-NRC protestors returning from the protest at White House landed at the embassy. It was a group of around four to five hundred people chanting ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" and ""CAA has to GO"". That confused the BJP supporters among the celebrators. They started to break away from the face-off with Pro-Khalistan supporters and started gathering to face the Anti-CAA crowd. Since ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" was already being used by the Anti-CAA protestors, they resorted to the ""Modi-Modi"" chant. As the crowd was huge and with all the commotions, a few of Anti-CAA protestors drifted towards the Khalistani group due to confusion. The Indian authorities acted sensibly by announcing on the mic that the Anti-CAA group should be wary of standing near the Anti-Indian Khalistan group, which showed the authorities' respect for the CAA protest. The CAA protestors quickly adhered to their request. 

At this face-off, the more responsible citizens from both sides went to each other with a request of peace which gave birth to some really peaceful debate on the topic. An old age man confronted a few protestors to explain why CAA is the need of the hour but also said that he respects their right to protest. And several such examples floated around. Amid all the shouting, chaos, sloganeering and patriotism on both sides, the beautiful colours of our Democracy were visible on foreign land.

We wanted to eat in our car on our way home but the noodle-waalah didn't have any plates handy, so I spent Rs 3 of my hard earned money at a nearby pan shop for a large paper plate. Having feasted to our hearts' content, my wife, who was in the passenger seat, wanted to throw the plate by the road side. I told her that she can leave the plate in the car and that I will trash it once we reach home and I started driving.

From past experiences, she is well aware that I hate littering. Initially she protested that it is not her fault that there were not enough trash cans (while we were driving home in the car, wtf). Then she said she will only throw it where she finds a trash can. Then, a minute later, she wanted me to slow down near a foot path and lower the window. At this point, I knew she was about to get her way. The henpecked loser that I am, I slowed down to a crawl towards the footpath, checked the rear view mirror hoping no one was watching us and lowered the window.

Dear wifey neatly folded the paper plate, and in world-famous Indian fashion, chucked it out of the vehicle's window.

1) Sort Code

2) SWIFT

I Googled a lot but couldn't find anything helpful. Sort code is used in the UK, so is it fine to leave the field blank since my bank is in India, not UK? India doesn't even follow IBAN, so what should I write in that field? And for SWIFT, on Googling the best I could find was [this](https://retail.onlinesbi.com/nri/remittances/sbinri_rem_bran_swfcode.html) list by SBI with SWIFT codes, but the list doesn't have the name of my branch (which is SBI ISM CAMPUS, Dhanbad).

2138,"Positive and productive Randians. What are the small trivial overlooked things that add value to your life ?I'm a 23 (M) Indian. Being a single kid, I was overfed and pampered, food became my coping mechanism for stress and anxiety. I became obese as a result. I always did the bare minimum and satisficed, my academic requirements. 

I'm also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, coupled with bad parenting this has resulted in poor personal hygeine, extremely unhealthy relationship with food such that a vicious cycle exists; low mood, binge eating on junk, low personal hygiene, untidy room, lack of routine which again results in a low mood, it is a vicious cycle. 

In my Pre University College, I joined an organisation (NCC) with a strict hierarchy and discpline. I greatly, benefitted from the discpline that was imparted to me. I became extremely healthy (BMI 23) and productive following that period.   

I adopted small behavioural and lifestyle changes that added a lot of value to my life. Things like waking up early in the morning around 04:30 hours , always drinking water sitting down relaxed and sipping at it slowly ,which is more hydrating than drinking water standing up and gulping it down. Going for a long run early in the morning, where I reflect and contemplate on the things to do, reading a newspaper daily, sitting in vajrasana post meals, practicing mindfulness and concentrating only on food while I eat.

During this period, I was extremely good with women, I almost always had my pick of women; I was never a humorous person. My lack of humour was compensated in the  fact that I was well travelled, well read and healthy; able to engage them in various topics across discplines and great travel stories. This automatically 'qualified' me to them, making them very receptive to casual touching and breaking physical barrier was much easier for me than the rest of my colleagues. Similarly, as they had 'qualified' to me unwittingly, they end up laughing much more than they should and stick up with lame non humorous jokes that I crack. 

Also, among my male colleagues, I was offered a much higher position of power than what I deserved,  I was put on a pedestal, where others looked up to me to make decisions where even I was clueless, this'd repeat even if I had made the 'suboptimal' decision earlier until and unless there is another male who was willing to take 'charge'. 

Gradually, over the course of time, along with my growth in confidence, I grew in pride. I thought that I had become invincible. But, I was gravely mistaken. I had a burnout due to the extremely strict regime that I had been following. I was not flexible with myself, I convinced myself that anything bad is a cardinal sin. I learnt the hard way that we need our ocassional indulgences. 

It's okay to take afternoon siestas ocassionally, it's okay to indulge in a gelato once in a while. It's okay to miss a day of running. 

Last year, was the year where I had a burnout and relapsed. I gained 28 kilos in a year, from 75 to 103 KG. The empire that I had built came crashing down and I was grounded again. At the start of the depressive phase, I knew, I was spiralling in the wrong trajectory, but at that period I was not aware that it is these small lifestyle changes that had added value to my life in the first place and made me positive during my 'positive phase'. 

So, I struggled without avail for a year at my home, I saw all my relationships crumbling, my career stalling and my transient friends leaving me except for a few trustworthy friends. Recently, I took a break and came to my aunts place at Chennai. She is a very strong willed, assertive and strict women. She is a person who wouldn't put up with my unruliness and unkempt lifestyle. She pushed me to do tiny things like doing my bed daily after waking up, going for a walk in the morning, fixed timings for  my meals and eliminated all forms of processed foods. Restricted my calorific intake to what is necessary and not what I craved. 

My body and mind slowly started adopting to these changes around me. I started transitioning from a phase of a spiralling negative vicious cycle to a virtuous positive cycle. I learnt to be flexible with myself, learning from my past experience. 

I learnt that productivity is a byproduct of a positive lifestyle. Now, I want to achieve greater productivity levels than my past positive phase. Any habits or lifestyles practiced by you or which you swear by, will greatly be appreciated as I try to pick up the broken fragments and try rebuilding my life from scratch. 

It can be something as random as practicing vajrasana (yoga pose ) post meals that aid in digestion to sleeping on your back (optimal sleeping position ) to practicing a breathing exercise to mitigate against anxiety and control cravings. Though include in the comment how to perform, what you've specified.

Apparently, between 1918 and 1920, an influenza outbreak, which later became infamous as  the ""Spanish flu"" killed approximately 18 million people all across India (many more millions around the world too). About 6% of the Indian population died off within a couple of years!

And finally, lets hope corona virus doesn't go the same way as Spanish flu. The world is in a much better place now than how it was in 1920s (world war 1 etc) and fingers crossed, we handle this better this time around! Stay safe r/indians!!",1580151418.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,38

Then I came back to a house where all the rooms were small, like the small rooms of a jail. From the window, I saw my brother outside in the garden. He was on a swing, going back and forth, the kind of which the children swing in the park. But the garden outside was narrow and it was getting dark. In his arms was a small monkey. I went to the next room, my mother was sitting and cutting vegetables with a plastic knife. I asked her where my father was. She said, ""He has gone to see the doctor"". I realized that not just me, my entire family was in an asylum. They have nothing. I did not know if I should be sad because they were there for no reason or I should be happy because I had the company of my family. I told my mother that I saw my brother in the garden behind the house. She said that I should speak to him as after all he was my brother. I screamed at her.

2348,"What do you think about the current situation in Kashmir?What do you think about the ongoing situation in Kashmir?

Ever since article 370 was revoked, there has been a lot of talk about kashmir these days. Modi gobermint did a terrible job, by commiting massive human rights violations in Kashmir, by imposing a 5 month long curfew, detaining thousands of people including children. The economy of kashmir is experiencing a loss Rs. 20,000 crore. Tourism has dropped by 86%. The people there are suffering.

As expected the people of Kashmir resent india, now thanks to Modi's move they resent even more strongly. So he did pretty opposite to the idea of 'integrating kashmir with india'.

However, the majority of the people in Kashmir want independence. They do not want to be with india.

The Indian army has also have commited attrocites in Kashmir, like raping or sexually assaulting women and torturing people. So while Pakistan also have commited attrocites in Kashmir but India isn't innocent either.

So, many people demand independence. But will giving independence to Kashmir to solve this 70+ years long conflict? If not independence, then what is the solution to the Kashmir conflict? Would forming something like the EU in the subcontinent help?",1580059293.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,4,3

2389,"Does anyone know this movie?There is this Indian (possibly Bollywood) movie that I watched a long time ago. I don't remember the name of it or its actors. I don't even remember the full plot of it, but here's what I remember:

It was a little old comedy movie. Somewhere in that movie, someone hires a killer to kill another one. IIRC, the killer had killed 99 people in the past, and this would be his 100th victim. But as the movie goes on, all his attempts to kill the target victim fails hilariously. He tries one trick after the other, but they all cause harm to a third person instead of harming the target victim.

At the climax, the police arrests the killer. At that moment, he throws a brick at the target victim. But, as same as always, the brick hits the third person.

I vaguely remember like Naseeruddin Shah was the killer and Deven Verma was the third person. But I am sure that I must be wrong.

Most of them will either go to their Medicine retailer friend and get some medicine without knowing the cause or visit a local family doctor who bought the degree from somewhere. And having seen the Nipah virus movie, hats off to the doctor for tackling it on time , but the entire spread of the virus happened in the hospital itself. Our hospitals are not equipped to handle such a scenario. 
Secondly Indian climate and demographic will enable the virus to spread like wild fire.

2428,"Dogged a bullet or actually found a girl?I had a college crush, we hardly talked in college and  it's been around 2 year, I never contacted her since college. So, last month I mustard courage to ask her out. To my surprise she said yes.  We met and I had a time of my life. Usually I'm very uncomfortable when I go out even with my friends and use phone frequently to come out of this but the time spent with her was nice and I didn't even thought about the phone or time when I was with her. 

I didn't said anything to her at that point but latter when I reached home I messaged her about my feelings for her.  She didn't reply at that time and said we will talk about this latter. Later in the day I received message from her saying that she would love to have someone like me in her life and she will be really happy if she could find someone like me but she is now kind of stuck in a situation where she cannot go against her parents will of marrying in another cast. And situation is like where cast is very important factor for her marriage. I wasn't prepared for issue to escalate to the marriage. And I said can't do much and best of luck for your life.


And moved on later I realise we don't even know each others cast there might be possiblity that may be we both can go ahead in our life together. And I asked her if cast is the only issue? shouldn't we first confirm about this with someone before making the decision, she guessed my cast from last name and said cast is the only issue, there were previous instances of intercast marriage  in her family with her  brother so now all the hopes are pinned on her for arrange marriage. She also had promised her parents that they can go ahead and find a guy for him. So she can't go back on that. I again said ok and moved on.

Latter on the day she messaged me something and deleted that. I asked her what was that. She  said that she asked about our cast being compatible with her mother and her mother said that her father would never allow this to happen.  She thought it is already a known issue so deleted that. 


Now I have gone through multiple threads related to cast where people suggested it is good if person tells you in advance if there will be issue in her family due to cast in future. Feel like doged a bullet there, would have really tough if we moved on and  later she decide to ditch me and marry where her parents decide.

I also feel like how gracefully she rejected and told me in the very beginning and started thinking about her way too much now.  
I know nothing can be done here. But for some reason I still have hope that something magically going to change and we will be together. May be stupid romantic movies have corrupted my mind.",1580061991.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,18,20

When I reached New Delhi T-2 terminal and got my bag I noticed that the bag had been broken in transit. I went to the GoAir counter and filed a complaint regarding my broken luggage. The person in charge there took the details and told me that GoAir will contact me via email in a few days.


On 2nd January, I received an email saying that they are willing to compensate me with Rs 2000. When I told them that the bag costed more and that they should either compensate me the full amount or send me a new bag of the same model, they emailed me that they cannot send me a new bag and they told me to email them a copy of the bill. 


I then sent them a copy of the bill, which clearly stated that the bag was bought in September 2019 (it was almost brand new) and it costed me Rs 8600. After emailing them the bill, they called me and asked me why I wasn't claiming the warranty on the bag. When I told them that the warranty didn't cover damage due to negligence and that the warranty only covered manufacturing defects the representative from GoAir told me that they will discuss with the team and respond back.


Then they responded back that they are only going to compensate me with Rs 4000. When I asked them that how did they reach that number they said that they cannot discuss this and they are not going to entertain any further queries.


Through this ordeal GoAir has been highly unprofessional and I have been highly disappointed in there customer service. This whole thing makes me never want to travel with GoAir again. 


Does anyone know what my other options are?

2452,"(CsCareerQuestion) What should I be spending my time on (DS/Algorithm or Improving on my Web Tech Stack) for my first job switch.I have been working almost a year as a Web Dev in a product company. My job is mostly backend with Ruby on Rails and some Java / Spring Boot for micro services. I am getting paid 5L.

So my question is when/if I am going to switch jobs after a year, what should I be working on. 

1. Improve the knowledge of my existing tech stack, read a frontend framework (planning on react for now), read a new backend framework (node js) cause lot of start ups put it as a requirement

2. Go back to DS and algo questions like my college placements days. Do companies still ask those in interviews? Read those tricky Java interview questions?

I like my job here. In my company I have heard cases of guys going from 5 to 10L in 4 years and others stagnating. So I am not sure what to expect at all.

If i plan to change what should I be working on now?",1580026740.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,18

As a dark-skinned south Indian woman, I have always been at the brunt of racism from my school friends while growing up. In my family, those who were darker than me were treated even worse.

[Mural graphic drawn by Karthiknathan S. to represent the Fundamental Right to Privacy ](https://preview.redd.it/2ser7nm2x2d41.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=6fea5aa1425c06d6d3d5119d9318cf9cc6394e16)

Today marks our 71st Republic day. It's been an [annual tradition of sorts](https://internetfreedom.in/a-republic-day-letter-from-iff/) at IFF to use this occasion to reflect and also indicate what small role we hope to play in support of our constitutional ideals.

## India stands on the edge of a technological precipice

Over a year, IFF's work has strengthened on the basis of the generosity and support of many volunteers, collectives and organizations. In many ways  our advocacy has merely been a top-dressing to a richer foundation prepared with the time and labor of others. Today our mission is stronger both in our ability to do our work and cause impact due to these networks of sharing.

To  cause change over the last year IFF has done substantial institutional  engagement on issues ranging from net neutrality, free expression,  privacy and innovation. These are publicly documented on the website and  I invite you to go through them. As we grow capacity, our work will  become more technology, campaign and public centered. This is not to  say, there have not been attempts over the past year. IFF has become  better at collaborations with other individuals and organizations  primarily in the fields of community building and public talks. We would  like to believe we are contributing to greater partnership in the  domains of design, law and computer sciences which are talking to each  other more regularly than ever before.

We  have tried to swiftly respond when citizen needs have arisen on issues  such as intermediary liability, malware hacks, surveillance drones,  facial recognition and internet shutdowns. This has been followed up  with persistent representations, RTIs and even court challenges. Our  greater realization is that much of this work interacts with Government  institutions. It often requires a fresh set of regulations and by its  very nature the results are tangibly felt in the medium to long term. To  accelerate timelines, one of IFF's missions has to be to complement the  power of movements with building resilient organizational capacity.

Financial  sustainability is vital to make such policy victories a practised reality. We have approached fundraising and our expenses with, civic  legitimacy, discipline and transparency (*transparency is major component of our website re-design that will roll out in May, 2020*).  We have focused on implementing a model of individual giving and  recurring donations that provides five membership tiers and receives  funds only from Indians. These have helped us achieve a marginal level  of predictability in fund flows and a continuous channel of feedback and  co-ownership. All of this is a process of iteration and learning.

We  need to do more to come close to our projected revenue targets that are  accommodated by the generous buffer provided by organizational donors.  Many of them have donated to IFF after learning about our work through  our members who have championed our cause to their management. We are  thankful to each one of them, for helping us do our work independently  and even providing us an opportunity to have conversations with them to  explore how digital rights can help improve user trust in their  products.

Today, donations help fund 3 staffers, an off-counsel. Soon 2 more people will be hired to ""*secure*""   the values of the Indian constitution as put forth in the Preamble.  All IFF volunteers, staff and leadership are guided by a sense of  urgency, recognizing that each day is a call to action to defend your  liberty, equality, fraternity and justice in our digital republic. Dr.  B. R. Ambedkar, put it best, just before the Preamble was put to vote  and adopted, “*I say that this  Preamble embodies what is the desire of every member of the House that  this Constitution should have its root, its authority, its sovereignty,* ***from the people***. ***That it has***.”

We are committed to serving everyday Indians like you.

If you would like to support our mission in 2020, I invite you to[ become a IFF Member](https://internetfreedom.in/donate/) today.

2564,"Thoughts about this great country on the eve of this memorable day.Me staring thru the window in an India wherein there still are people who give a damn about the constiution which came into power today, I hope you're one of them. 
Moreover, I hope the leaders of this great country realise what this country's real potential is and that you serve us and we are not meant to do what we are doing on a daily basis to get your attention.
The reality is that you have nothing to show to us. 
EVERYTHING is falling down for you, We as a society, as a country wanted to provide all the crucial first world benifits to every citizen of this country and become developed*. Bam! That isn't so hard, I mean, if Kejriwal* can do ""that"" to Delhi in 5 years he did exactly as was necessary for a region to become developed. Look at that solid base that he developed. All while not having control of all the aspects of governance.  Is there even one base made like that of the things which kejriwal has by the modi governance in the last 5.5 years?
All while having so much money in their hands?
Kejriwal ne usko milne wali extreme amount of tax income ka faida uthaya. 
Same benifit NaMo government ko bhi hai.. close your eyes for a sec and imagine the possibilities, immediately  that thought will be hijacked with the fact that it's all going exactly in the opposite direction... how tiring is that? 


What I'm wanting is the real deal. All of us want that to happen. It's THE fantasy.
Now. The protests that are happening are a great opportunity to ask the government these questions too. 

All of us hate our current schooling system. We should raise a voice against this too. 
All of us hate the fact that due to reservation injustice hota hai students ke saath, par We dont acknowledge the fact that there are millions who are still not able to live the life that you and I are able to because of the shithouse practise untouchability by the members of this society. We know who they are. Why don't we raise a voice against them, try and change their mindset. 
There are a million more things that are wrong about this society. I just have examples of two main types of them.

Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high

Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by narrow domestic walls

Where words come out from the depth of truth

Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit

Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever-widening thought and action

Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.

The main thing preventing me is health concerns. I don't have any **serious** health conditions, but I do tend to get sick more frequently than the average person. I feel like any time a virus is going around, I catch it and I stay sick longer than other people. I have skin issues too (eczema) and have generally sensitive skin and hair.

I have had many tests done and I don't seem to have a technically weak immune system or anything, but I just tend to get sick more easily than others in my experience.

I know that there are a lot of precautions to take regarding food/water/mosquitoes, but is there anything that you guys can advise me in order to make my trip to India as healthy as possible? 

I know that it's best to avoid monsoon season for mosquitoes; is March/April a good time to come?

Thanks for the help!",1580014611.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,8,17

2713,"My fears about how the current political situation would affect the Republic Day celebrations turned out to be true.I've been attending the flag hoisting at our colony's association building for years now. Our colony has always been a lot diverse in terms of religion. Everything was normal after the flag hoisting ceremony, members of the association gave speeches about our constitutional rights, fundamental rights and duties as well as secularism but it soon went downhill from that.

Another man from the colony started his speech about how our constitution and laws need amendments time after time and we should support them, and then he yelled that no matter what we believe we are must respect the national flag and national anthem and those who didn't do that or didn't return the cheer of ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" are of no use to this colony or nation. An odd 4-5 people clapped at his statement after which he proceeded to yell ""Bharat Mata ki Jai"" and specifically pointed out this Old Muslim Man who wore a skull cap and came with his grandchildren of about 6-7 years of age that he wasn't cheering the same and he shouldn't stay here. When the old man started to leave, all the 10-12 association members and the president consoled him to stay while he was pulling away, his grandchildren started crying and the 20-25 odd schoolchildren who were there looked perplexed.

The old man decided to stay albeit being a lot sadder and angrier, yelling that he's been here longer than he has and is more patriotic than he ever will be. This incident was followed by the Association President's message that ""No person was supposed to force his beliefs and practices. Everyone has the right to cheer or not cheer for whatever they want"". He proceeded to apologise to the man for the speaker's words and invited him specifically to the function after this. The members of the association then proceeded to apologise and console him. 

Meanwhile, the man who gave the statement was being confronted by a single person for his words and was also being supported by one other man. He shook his hand and praised him for his words.

Ironically, the man who supported his words had stuck his paper flag on his heart turned upside down. 

This incident had me fuming but I calmed down after reminding myself that it was one guy (and the 4-5 odd people who clapped for him) against the 10-12 members and elders of the association who consoled the old man.

[Image from the incident](http://imgur.com/a/a4JA2Qb)

The man in the blue shirt and the red circle was the one who gave the speech, the man in the brown shirt and the blue circle was the man who supported him. The other man in white confronted him and counselled him for his words. I could add a voice record that I recorded out of fear and anticipation that something of this sort would happen.

TL;DR : Muslim man was told to leave the flag hoisting event by a person for not cheering ""Bharat Mata Ki Jai"" infront of  association members and children from the colony. Association apologizes and condemns his words.",1580019690.0,#ea0027,Unverified,light,36,232

2780,"Periyar-beyond adulation and anger:Subramania Iyer , the co-founder of The Hindu bluntly wrote on caste discrimination and also got his widowed daughter remarried against all social pressure, in 1889.

Subramania Bharathi openly protested against caste, patriarchy and irrationalism much before 1920. His daughter, and daughter of his friend Mandayam Srinivasachar, both young girls, were made to give feminist speeches to women audience.

Muthulakshmi Reddy, well known for social reforms, became a surgeon and had a late-by-then-standard and cross caste marriage before the Justice Party was even formed.

Iyothee Dass Pandithar had taken anti-hinduism and anti-brahmin stands on question of social reform in 1890's itself.

Gopalkrishna Bharathi used art to argue against caste discrimination, and wrote Nandanar in mid-19th century, which was also quite ahead of its time.

And so on.

So Periyar was not a pioneer with all these things. But he was, a bit ironically, to social reform( down south) what Mahatma Gandhi was to freedom struggle all over India. Gandhi's ideology had existed in parts much before him, even within India. He contributed by a synthesis and popularisation of those aspects. EVR took the existing ideals to the masses, with increased fervour and excellent organization, much like MKG. Like MKG, his aura was also due to the fact that he seemed to seek nothing for himself out of all this- in fact this was remarked by very Mr.Cho Ramasamy in a magazine's compilation of 100 remarkable Indians! Periyar denied himself political or monetary benefits he could have otherwise obtained. In a sense he seemed to be a sort of honest activist, irrespective of the merits or otherwise of his activism. 

His activism was unquestionably impactful, but it is doubtful if it was successful in the longer run. His anti-hindu stand was directed against Brahmin at the top of the hierarchy but eventually ended up hurting the faith of people across the social pyramid. That the oppressed classes hold religion closer to their heart than even Brahmins, and have always had a psychological and social need for it, has often escaped the brilliant minds of reformers. Periyar was no different. His methods and words only pushed the religious Hindu of different strata to a corner, turning them defensive. In the hindsight, he merely gave a larger intellectual foundation to existing politics of Justice Party and inspired a generation of young activists. His feminist stance was certainly radical, though not unheard of, earlier. But by pushing a section of people to the wall, Periyar inadvertantly caused them to turn deaf ears to his other progressive ideals. 

And coming back to the MKG analogy, if periyar is vehemently hated by some much like how Gandhi is hated by a section- it is because their followers deified them way too much. They were certainly greater men than most of us but naturally flawed. Like supporters of Mahatma, Periyarists have exaggerated many of his contributions and subdued appreciation of others. Two examples are that of the Vaikom struggle and the Devadasi-system abolition movement. Periyar certainly played a visible role in the former, but along with many others who were inspired by Mahatma Gandhi and Narayana Guru. As for the latter, its leader Muthulakshmi Reddy has written that many leaders across political spectrum and social background helped her in passing the Act, except a few who raised obstacles. On both these count, Periyarists have tried to exaggerate his contribution, bordering on hagiography. 

And such deification and control of popular narrative results in supressed discontent which surface eventually , with equivalent vehemence. This is true for anti-Periyar anger as much as the anti-Gandhi one.

Add to this, all the arguments against his political ideology, apparent hypocrisy or flip-flops or even personal conduct. Coming back again, these are the very same points on which MKG is debated about, even today. And will need to be debated on, in the future too.

Both Subramania Bharathi and Periyar are said to have had their life-turning moments in the holy Kasi- though in starkly different ways- which just indicates the subjectivity of their experiences. All these great men were product of their times- often unfinished. 

All these show that Periyar as well as his followers are/were humans, as are others. Between Periyar the messianical panacea for Tamil society and the evil and ignorant nemesis, lies the true periyar we can appreciate, as well as critique with respect!

Minoo Masani, a liberal we have almost forgotten, said that making a religion out of Marxism- the dogmatic adherence and rejection of criticism- was rather a big mistake, say an injustice to Marx himself. This applies to Periyarism as well.",1579972230.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,9,16

I can't afford to lose my current job as my parents are somewhat dependant on me.

So I was looking up some options and came across this Online masters program (WILP) from BITS and some Course Era courses from Universities.

I want to keep my options open so if anyone did any online courses, can you please share your experiences and if you can, give some advice as I really want to do masters.

This whole thing is really confusing and it's making me anxious.

\- What are my options right now and how should I proceed with it?

2854,"The condition of the LGBTQ+ community in India.The Trans Bill was passed a month ago and the popular media didn't even cover it. It is an inhumane bill which effectively and actively oppresses their community. The general public views them with disgust but I thought they would at least have the basic human decency to not support a bill which ruins their entire lives. But now the bill is an Act and the general public still supports the bill. 


Changing the society takes pro-active measures and I understand that our country has so many social issues to deal with that this issue gets buried under them but this cannot explain the legislative measures against the Trans community. 



How is any of this going unnoticed? It fills me with such deep sorrow to know that my mom thinks all Homosexuals should be killed. And mind you, she is a liberal. 



In my school we once had a cultural exchange with students from Sweden and a girl couple was queer. They were shunned by everyone, nobody even went near them. Students disgusted their presence. When the Senior Coordinator came to know about this, she even barred them from going on some trip the students were going to. When I asked them, they replied that she said something along the lines of ""We don't entertain **unnatural behaviour**."" 




I believe at least schools should be trying to help children develop a healthy mindset. 




Even if one would sate this behaviour due to the religious nature of our people, Hinduism accepts the Third Gender, the gender fluidity of Hindu deities, and notes that “everything in this world is a reflection of the original subtle and spiritual reality"".Mahabharata features the transgender character Sikhandin, and depicts the warrior Arjuna cross-dressing to become Brihannala, teacher of fine arts. Vedic culture allowed transgender people of the third sex, known as hijras, to live openly according to their gender identity. 



I personally think that this mindset can be linked to the British influence India has had but even they were able to crawl out of it so why can't we?

I had never seen this guy's video before. But it popped in my recommendations, so I watched the video. And I felt that they made a very strong and informed case for why CAA & NRC are unnecessary, how the government is playing vote bank politics with it, and how the person who will suffer the most will be the poor people.  


Then I read the comments. \~90% of the top comments are just trolling the video, pro-hindurashtra and basically the kind where you can't logically argue with them.  
It is just sad. Not only the fact that people can't see what's going due to their hate toward muslims which they somehow tie with their sense of nationalism, but also that there are so many of them. The latter troubled me the most. Their are so many people protesting against CAA & NRC but there are 10 times more people that think it is a good thing.",1579968340.0,,CAA-NRC,dark,27,81

I'm an NRI, with an ancestral house in Hyderabad.  I recently decided to sell it.  My tenant there, who's been there for four years  has refused to move out, saying that I am legally required to give him first preference to purchase it, and that he's willing to pay for the house. He has no contract -- he just pays me monthly rent, and I've given him two months notice, but he has no intention of honouring it.

I don't believe he will offer fair price at this point, but more importantly, I have no desire to sell it to this guy.  He's a lawyer.

What are my options?  I'm worried that if I file a case to evict, it will drag for years. I cannot afford to spend extended periods of time away from my job, in Hyderabad, fighting a nasty tenant.",1579999618.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,12,7

I think the prime minister and the BJP have been able to intimidate a lot of the media…not all of it…Thank God! They’ve been able to do stuff on courts that I didn’t think was possible.

Aware that my writing this won’t make a difference but the Shaheen bagh situation is pissing me the hell off and I need to vent somewhere. It’s been over 40 days since fanatics from Shaheen bagh blocked the Delhi-Noida link via Kalindi Kunj. As a resident of Jasola, that happens to be right beside Shaheen bagh, I think I’m allowed to say the amount of inconvenience caused and still being caused is getting intolerable and agitating with each passing day. I’m not gonna express my views on NRC or CAA cuz this isn’t about it. The issue is that a bunch of fanatics have taken over an entire road for over a month and idk for what purpose. Yeah, they reserve the right to protest but you can’t just protest wherever you want. They’re pissed at the government but that doesn’t give them the right to make the general public’s life miserable for so long. Kalindi kunj road is the main link to noida for most of south Delhi. A ton of workers and students are being forced to take detours, getting stuck in traffic jams for hours to reach their offices, schools, colleges. Tons of resources like time and fuel are getting wasted. If one looks at it from a wider perspective, the overall productivity in offices is being hampered with. The country’s resources are being wasted because a group of people have taken over a road and turned it into what looks like a fairground to me more than a protest site. They are screaming slogans of freedom and justice, how the hell is blocking a road and causing a load of trouble to the general public that isn’t even responsible for the act fair ? I’m sorry to say but it’s extremely selfish, inconsiderate and ironic that those screaming for justice are trying to bring the county for a halt for a purpose I fail to understand. You wanna protest ? Go to Rajghat, Rashtrapati Bhavan, India gate, jantar mantar, Ramleela maidan, parliament or even the prime minister’s residence. Just taking over a road, having picnics the whole day right outside your home sounds a very comfortable way to protest but it’s not acceptable when it’s at the expense of so many people who don’t deserve to face all these complications because someone pissed you off. It’s friggin messed up how nobody seems to care about the inconvenience they’re causing. You wanna support them? Fine but talk some sense into them. There are things that are just not okay and this is one of them. Lastly, the politicians who are are encouraging this for vested interests disgust me. Again, you wanna support them? fine, but this is not the way. Someone please for everyone’s sake, instead of encouraging or appreciating their “determination”, look at the wider picture, try to be less selfish and put an end to this mess.

In fact, you don't have that option because as a secular nation we have personal laws governing people of different religions and there is still no clear way, to make personal laws for atheists.

So purely for legal convenience, you've to choose a religion and put that on paper when filling out forms. Even though I follow no religion in practice and am an atheist, on paper (including my birth certificate), I'm a Hindu. Previously, this didn't bother me, because even though I write that on paper I knew it was only a matter of forms and convenience.  Nothing really significant is being decided based on that.
Recently, while filling out a loan application, I was asked my religion - and this time I was extremely hesitant about this question, filled with a feeling of guilt.

Previously on paper, I was part of a majority that was not treated any differently. Today, under a pro-Hindu Government, on paper I am part of a majority that is in fact being given special treatment.

I am suddenly the privileged man. Purely on paper, I am suddenly, due this Government, on the side that puts me on a pedestal while oppressing several others. Despite not being one in practice, on paper I'm on the side of the oppressor, under this Government.

As we committed today we are making  available a public analysis that helps you discover the top 10 issues  with this legislative proposal. Today we have provided three parts in [a public brief](https://saveourprivacy.in/media/all/Brief-PDP-Bill-25.12.2020.pdf) that covers the legislative history, a summary of top 10  issues and then a detailed clause wise analysis. We hope this helps you  form your own views and then participate in the consultation to help  bring the power of civic participation to data protection!

## How to participate in the Joint Parliamentary Committee

As we informed you yesterday, the Data Protection Bill, 2019 is  finally stepping towards a finalized version. It may soon pass through  parliament and become law.

The author suggests education as the only weapon to be employed. 
But, everybody can easily realise that the **present government** here, or, as a matter of fact, **all the capitalist governments** are not only not going to help any such effort, but on the contrary, **suppress it mercilessly**.

Then, what will his '**evolution**' achieve? 

We the revolutionaries are striving to capture power in our hands and to organize a revolutionary government which 
should employ all its resources for mass education.""

Bhagat Singh wrote this 90 years ago but it's scary this has been so relevant repeatedly since then from Indira's emergency to Jan Lokpal movement to now this farce we have for government. crazy part is he was only 21 or 22 when he wrote this. We as a nation were robbed of this brilliant man. If only he was there to guide us post independence.

3106,"17 y/o girl, wants to be a chef, parents stereotyping. [advice] 

I've been trying to make a post about this for a long time now, i feel like i haven't found the right words.

Anyway, I'm a 17 year old, in a tight corner. So to give you a backstory, I love baking/cooking and people say i'm a very good baker. I'm also a tennis player (national level). And i do well academically. I've always loved experimenting with my kitchen. so naturally i wanted to be a chef. As a person into many things, i feel like I'm more comfortable with culinary arts.

And I've been trying to convince my parents to get me into culinary school. They are not obliging. They feel that their child is 'too talented' and that my 'potential' is being wasted on culinary arts. and they're being very stereotypical and telling me that i'll have to cook for my husband after marriage anyway. And that being a chef isn't a 'respectable' profession. This has been going on for around 3 years now and I've made them talk to people, showed them all the researches i did on culinary arts and the career i could make out of it. and all the colleges i could get into but to no avail.

Sometimes it gets hard. My parents aren't exactly the type that appreciates you when you do something big. They just ask me to keep pushing no matter what. That kinda takes a toll on me oftentimes. and they want me to pursue engineering. I mean I'm okay with it but its not my thing. Maybe they're doing this because of the sports quota. they just keep telling me that i should pursue a 'noble' profession and not culinary arts. either engineering or english literature/sociology and take up UPSC exams.

It feels like they're living my life for me. I don't wanna sound ungrateful i love my parents for providing me with everything but i feel like there's a hidden motive. like my dad enrolling me in tennis coaching at a very young age and he straight up admitted recently that he did it because i'd get into engineering easily.

And two months ago when i was on the verge of giving into engineering, i told my parents that i was okay with either chemical engineering/aerospace but that's when i realised that they were controlling even the branch of engineering i'm supposed to take. They were hell bent on me taking up csc/ece. so ultimately i started resenting them (not only for this, but for various other reasons too).

Each day it keeps getting worse and i wanna move away for college and take up culinary arts. but my parents are so against me moving away for college . but I'm pretty sure they wouldn't pay my fee if i take up culinary arts. at this point I'm willing to move away for college regardless of the course. I feel like my parents are being narrow minded, the person i wanna be is exactly not the person they want me to be. The amount of toxicity that my parents are inflicting upon me is immeasurable.

If you've ever been in this position / have a piece of advice for me, please comment. If you wanna know more about a specific part here, ask me. I'd be happy to elaborate. This is very serious and I'm helpless.",1579950625.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,25

I've recently shifted to Dubai and been working here for a year now. And up until now it has been a great experience of the culture and country in general.

You find a lot cultural diversity at work or even at public places.

Needless to say, many Indians are there and are actually nice. But what I find weird is the age group of people in this country. And not only for Indians, but other nationalities as well.

There are very few people who are in their early twenties, like me and a lot of people in their thirties. Less single people and more married ones. Less females and more males.

I couldn't figure out the exact reason for it? 

Do people leave their home country after marriage? 

Or does females find themselves more attached to their home countries?

Or am I missing something out?

3184,"CRYSTAL CLEAR explanation of CAB-NRC!Be patient, keep an open mind and read each and every line carefully or you'll misunderstand the whole thing.

**CAB: Citizenship Amendment Bill**

During partition, some non-muslims moved to Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh. There they faced religious persecutions. Why? Because these are Islamic states. They have an Islamic Law. Here's an example. There was a guy in Pakistan who once insulted Prophet Mohammad. According to the 'LAW' in Pakistan, the guy was given the death penalty for insulting Mohammad. Abduction and r\*\*e of non-muslim girls in these countries happen every now and then.

Because of such religious persecutions happening all the time, these non-muslims decided to come to India. Some came to India in 1999, some in 2000, 2010, 2012 and so on.

Now, there's a significant number of these people 'living' in India. **But they DO NOT have Indian citizenship** and thus can't take the benefits of government schemes.

**What does CAB do?**

CAB gives citizenship to the people in India who came to India because of religious persecution and ALREADY staying in India. But the last date is 2014.

Let's look at an example.

John was scared of religious persecutions in Pakistan. John came to India in 2013. He can avail benefits of CAB.

Mary was scared of religious persecutions in Pakistan. Mary came to India in 2014. She CANNOT avail benefits of CAB.

**CAB IS NOT INVITING NEW PEOPLE IN INDIA!** It is only for those who were **already** living in India but did not have Indian citizenship.

**Why is CAB needed?**

As I said earlier, there is a significant number of these people in India who cannot take benefits of an Indian citizen. If we make them citizens, it will be easier for them to get an education, job, etc. By the way, illegal immigrants CAN also get certain jobs and start certain businesses in India right now.

**Why were the Muslims excluded from CAB?**

There was a list of all these people. This list consisted of people from almost all communities, except Muslims. There was no Muslim who came to India because he/she faced religious persecutions in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh.

**Is CAB taking away any Muslim's citizenship?**

CLEARLY NO.

**Isn't it against Article 14?**

NO. Theres a section called Reasonable Classification under article 15 which allows it to pass through. Thus it doesn't violate article 14.

Is everything clear till now?!

NOW, Coming to NRC...

**NRC: National Register of Citizens**

**What is NRC?**

Remember in school, the class teacher had something called a 'Register'. It contained the names of all students in the class. NRC is just like that. It's a register of the citizens of India. It's an upgrade of Aadhar. A person with Aadhar is not necessarily a citizen of India. Aadhar is partial identification. But with NRC, it's absolute.

**Why is NRC needed?**

Delhi: There are about 40,000 illegal Bangladeshi and Rohingya Muslim immigrants in Delhi.

Haryana: There are about 600,000 to 700,000 illegal immigrants.

In 2009 alone, about 7700 illegal immigrants from Pakistan resided in India.

Like this, there are millions of illegal immigrants coming and staying in India.  These people don't belong here. This is hurting India in every aspect. Be it land or economy.

**Will NRC take away only Muslims citizenship?**

Not true. Irrespective of the religion, anybody who doesn't have documents/bank accounts/witnesses will not get registered in India. Even if they are non-muslims, they will not be considered as Indian citizens. The non-muslims will not be able to register themselves as Indians because of CAA. CAA is ONLY applicable to religious persecuted minorities from Pak, Aghan, and Bangladesh, who are staying in India.

**What about those who don't have documents/bank accounts/witnesses?**

There's a bridge near my house. A family of beggars resides under that bridge. People around often help them with food, clothing, etc. They don't have documents/bank accounts/witnesses to prove their citizenship because they were NEVER the citizens of India. They never had any documents ever. They don't even know what NRC is and they don't even need to know, because it won't affect them. They will continue to live under the bridge.

NRC is aimed at illegal immigrants coming from neighboring countries in large numbers. They mainly come for economic reasons.

As you can see, neither CAB nor NRC is against the Muslims of any country at all.

I hope everything is crystal clear.

Misinformation and rumors are spread across the nation. Educate yourself and others as well. Don't just follow the bandwagon without knowing anything.

Hello everybody! A few weeks ago I asked I you guys would be interested in filling out a questionnaire, and you said you would :) This is the link to the google form, it'll take only a few minutes of your time and I would be very thankful if you took those. If you are uncomfortable answering a question, or you are short on time, don't be frightened to skip the question.

If you are interested about my project, here some information about it. I am from the Netherlands and am now in my final year of secondary school. As the last big project we have to make before we go to university we were free to choose whichever subject we liked, and spend at least 80 hours working on this per person with a group of 3. We chose to make a project about the difference in digitalisation between India and the Netherlands. For example the difference between the governmental actions, Digital India with you guys, and a project to fund innovating businesses in the Netherlands. The survey is mainly to compare what we found with the reality, did the differences actually occur, or did some people write about it and everybody just assumed it as the truth.

This is a ploy to change demographics of these areas to crush secessionist tendencies. These regions are strategically very important and a loyal population is something that would make Indias grip stronger. 

If they actually do manage to go through with it. It would be a good move, strictly from a pragmatic poverty but ethically It is wrong. Right of self determination will be taken from natives of these areas. 


I feel like this is a major reason. 

Another one, I think is to polarize the country so they can get more seats seats. This has been BJPs strategy for some time. They probably plan to pass further reforms with more seats. 

This will definitely fail as they will lose Bihar.

Just recently I came through videos of viral dancer going by name of baba Jackson and installed tiktok to watch his videos.
Browsing tiktok for the past few days made me realize....

You don't need money to buy happiness..there are teawallahs, slum dwellers ,even vegetable vendors who make tiktok videos , 
It may sound cringe but if you tell me to act happy or something, It would be damn difficult for me to even sport a smile ..being introvert is also a factor.

There are couples who don't even have a proper house of their own, yet they are confident and happy enough to make those lovey dovey cringe  videos.

I personally do not have a lot of understanding of cars and don't own one so cannot suggest much.



**Location:** Lucknow


**Use cases:** normal intra-city travel with infrequent trips (100km) to nearby cities. Note, that this car will be owned/driven/maintained by my dad who is retired. 

He would consider only Maruti or Hyundai brands. 
He used to drive Alto prior to this. 
After 10 years, the car isn't in a good shape but in a condition where a trade-in can be made. 


**Options are**:


1)  **Hyundai i10 Grand Sportz BSIV** (*not* the newer i10 Nios)

All in costing (including trade-in and various offers): INR 5.21L

Included: 1 year insurance, accessories (music player)

**Pros:** More modern, dad likes the look, has a rear camera (though I am not confident my dad would be using it much as he isn't tech-savyy)

**Cons:** ""Different"" brand for dad, concern wrt servicing and resale value, lower mileage. Importantly, this is a BS4 model.



2) **Swift Vxi BS VI**

All-in costing (including trade-in and various offers): INR 5.84L 

Included: 3 year insurance and 5 year warranty, fog lights, accessories (music player) and numberplate

**Pros:** Enticing bonus offers included, ""Maruti Suzuki"" is a known brand, BS6, higher mileage

**Cons:** No rear-view camera, more expensive and unsure if added cost difference of 60k is justifiable

________

**Main Concern**  is which car would be a better value for money in terms of ease of driving (he is 62), less head-ache in terms of servicing costs, and overall experience? Happy to hear from you any other points here.

3248,"Women's attitudes towards female sexualityOne of my ex-friend recently went through a divorce. At that time (back in 2010) she was married to a rich guy when she was 21 years old. She had her cell phone taken away and was ordered to stop going to college.

However, before she married her now ex-husband and even during her divorce, she'd often say things about sex or sexual intimacy that stunned me.... statements that would often leave me speachless.

Just a few examples: ""a woman can't and shouldn't have any sexual demands or shouldn't say what she wants/likes in the bedroom but a guy can make any sexual demand...the woman needs to learn to give in"", that ""you should never say no to your husband's sexual demands, even if you are sick or in pain"", everytime I'd try to educate my women-friends about sex, she'd say ""women don't need to know/learn how their bodies function, what a clitoris is, what orgasms are or how to satisfy themselves"", that ""ambitious career women (especially any woman who wants to be a lawyer) are incapable of being proper wives"" .......and these are just some off the top of my head.

What's really strange about all of this was that she got precisely the most chauvinistic husband that you could find and she divorced him because she couldn't handle it! :-/ 

He was demanding, controlling, physically abusive, tried to prevent her from seeing or talking to her parents, and coercive/rough in the bedroom...and I don't mean that in a good/consensual way. She eventually got fed-up, claimed she couldn't handle it anymore and ended up filing for divorce almost a year later. All this, while she was heavily pregnant.

Even during the divorce she would often say that she used to wonder if she could have saved her marriage if she simply put her pain and discomfort aside and simply met ALL his sexual demands....this, despite that fact that he used to force himself on her even when she was in pain.

I get that sexual intimacy is a normal part of any romantic/marital relationship and that it can create emotional attachment and closeness between couples. I also get that there are many, MANY women who have BDSM fantasies. I also get that many women love being a housewife or taking a submissive role in the relationship (both inside and outside the bedroom). But there is a HUGE difference between that and going around projecting your worldview on other women; preaching to all your women-friends that this is how women/wives MUST or SHOULD be/that this is how all heterosexual relationships SHOULD be and that any woman who doesn't fit neatly into this box is unfit to be a proper wife!

We all hail from a culture where not only are most marriages arranged but arranged marriages generally aren't initiated based on attraction, chemistry, love or connection but are mostly based on caste, status, educational/job qualifications and family background. 

Add to that toxicity, the topic of sex is not only treated as taboo but female sexuality is seen as something dirty or non-existant.

So when you have women being raised in a culture like ours, I guess I'm left wondering if most Indian women carry around these beliefs about their own bodies/sexualities or is it just my friend taking her old-fashioned, conservative and traditional beliefs to a whole other level?",1579875114.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,18,45

## Tl;dr

The important issue of our data and how it will be protected is right now pending in Parliament. In December it was refereed to a joint parliamentary committee that is now inviting views and comments from the public. To help you do this, we have prepared a summary of the Data Protection Bill, 2019 with our top 10 concerns that we will post out tomorrow. Today, we urge you to share this post that will inform your friends, family and social networks and help them get ready to participate in this democratic exercise!

## The joint parliamentary committee

The Data Protection Bill has been a long time coming. We finally seem to moving towards the final stages of this much awaited legislation with the government draft being considered by the Joint Parliamentary Committee. When this committee was formed on December 11, 2019 [we wrote to all of it's members](https://internetfreedom.in/transparent-and-accessible-joint-committee/) asking for more public participation and we are glad it has been opened up to public comments. However, many of our requests including preparing local language translations of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 and public depositions do not seem to have found favour. We promise to keep agitating these demands.

Please find below a [link to a tweet](https://twitter.com/LokSabhaSectt/status/1220636832561369089) from the Lok Sabha Secretariat spelling out the process. We further break it down for you here.

* **Last date of submission:** Comments have to be sent from three weeks of the publication of the notice. While the notice was published on 24.01.2020, the date within the image notes 22.01.2020. Further this notice has till 5:00 PM on 24.01.2020 not been made available on the Lok Sabha website. We still urge participants to prepare and send their views within the inner timelines to provide adequate time to all members to study and deliberate their submissions.
* **Contact:** Submissions can be made only in English and Hindi and must be addressed to the Director, Lok Sabha Secretariat, Room No. 014, Ground Floor, Parliament House Annexe, New Delhi - 110001 or by email to [jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in](mailto:jpc-datalaw@sansad.nic.in)  and [mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in](mailto:mrs.mlekhi@sansad.nic.in).

## What does #SaveOurPrivacy plan to do ahead?

SaveOurPrivacy has worked since May, 2018 as a framework for civil society groups to put forward demands on data protection and surveillance reform.

3311,"What the BJP is thinking right now, about how all this would unfold [P]Some points after I had a discussion with a senior journalist in Delhi. Writing this here, as no journalist can come out and say stuff directly in the media.

1) They think they have achieved their objective. Hindu consolidation has happened, enough to get them the required seats in LS. Whether they lose all others, they don't care.

2) They think the protests will die down soon, even though discontent will remain. They are not worried about occasional huge rallies, or some sit-ins like Shaheen Bagh. Reason - refer to Pt. 1

3) UP has done exactly what they wanted. That when possible, BJP will beat down and kill all opposition to it. The message is conveyed, making their vote bank very happy indeed. Back to Pt. 1

4) Fuck the economy. Not really, but because they have no choice. They have begun to finally come out of denial, but the result is to say, fuck it, we will do what we need to do win 2024. So fuck the economy.

5) Also, unfucking the economy means letting go of big governance, not coming up with hare-brained schemes, and pacifying the society. They are in no mood to pacify the society, so fuck the economy.

6) Also, let foreign investment go to hell. Because foreign investment will come only if 'buses are not burning', as Sadguru says! Well, foreign investment will not come to a highly stressed society which is not feeling optimistic and is in no mood to spend. So fuck investment.

7) We will try to create a Ambani / Adani / Baba / BJP-centric oligopoly, and they will do well. They will be loyal and 'patriotic' and that's what works for BJP.

8) But can BJP sustain this, and ride on till 2024 elections? Now that is the part they do not know. What if economy worsens suddenly and fast? Will the diversions and polarisation be enough then? They do not know, but they will try everything to make sure that's enough.

9) Even if everyone else comes together, a Hindu vote consolidation in the right 300 seats would be enough. So try everything to get that right, and fuck all else.",1579856575.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,45,137

BJP has fucked our country. Corruption has not decreased and now we are i famous for religious bigotry. I was in Singapore last week and a person asked me if I was a hindu. I asked why do you care? He said he read about the marginalization of muslims in UP and wondered if I also nursed a hatred against the religion. I was stunned.

I grew up in Gujarat and voted for Modi twice in the state elections. He genuinely did good work there.

3320,"For those who still insist that CAA, NPR have no effect on Indians & those who are here legallySo the premise that the CAA, NRC and such ways to profile the population of the country (under the pretext of checking illegal immigration) is fundamentally flawed. 

It is just a ruse. Slowly and gradually - the segregation , the discrimination will spread. Till it becomes all consuming 

A few days ago, this happened:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/hundreds-of-huts-of-illegal-bangladeshi-immigrants-razed-in-bengaluru-turns-out-all-are-indians-2465113.html

Based on a vague complaint by an MLA. But an action which resulted in the actual demolition of housing (admittedly, slums - but housing nevertheless)

So the problem wasn't slums (which would've been a noble cause) - but slums occupied by perceived ""foreigners"" 

As of today, another politician has raised suspicion that a bunch of construction workers were foreigners - because he saw them eating ""poha"":

https://www.news18.com/news/buzz/bjp-leader-who-thinks-eating-poha-makes-one-bangladeshi-has-united-all-foodies-against-him-2471355.html

Poha. Please understand.... ""P.O.H.A"".....

So - clearly - there is no actual basis for these actions & statements. But houses *have been* damaged and lives have been disrupted.

Now - a lot of the affected folks *did* have proof in the form of Aadhar cards, PAN Cards. 

So imagine the state of the folks - who don't have the (right\any at all) paperwork. Those folks shall be thrown into detention centres:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/assam-detention-centre-inside-indias-1st-detention-centre-for-illegal-immigrants-after-nrc-school-ho-2099626

But in a turn of events that not many are surprised by - the PM is straight up denying the very existence of such a detention centre:

https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/pm-modi-on-citizens-list-nrc-rumor-of-detention-center-raised-by-congress-and-urban-naxals-is-a-lie-2152700

The idea is - if such blatant lies & borderline fascism isn't stopped right away - it will keep growing and expanding and directly affecting more and more sections of the population.

One religious minority today, another tomorrow, backwards castes and tribes, sexual minorities and more.

Mind you - the ruling party threatened an entire state with blocked ration concessions - because Kerala objected to the implementation of NPR.

https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/bjp-leader-claims-kerala-won-t-get-ration-after-stopping-npr-yechury-says-we-ll-see-114872


For all the love & online appreciation we shower on those who have served in our armed forces, the same isn't extended to them in real life. Here is the case one such decorated Army veteran:

https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-48523963

In what is quite possibly ***one of the highest profile situations*** to have arisen out of this entire fiasco, relatives of our former President have been excluded from the list of ""citizens"" in Assam - where the NRC was first implemented to near disastrous results:

https://www.news18.com/news/india/nrc-list-2019-former-president-fakhruddin-ali-ahmeds-family-among-2-million-in-assam-staring-at-uncertain-future-2291967.html


Now - either you are somehow still completely unaware of such events - or know about it but choose to turn a blind eye, willingly.

If it's the former - i hope my response ( and proof) makes you realize the events & brutalities that exist outside our admittedly privileged lives.

If it's the latter - well, i can't do much.

Edit: Thank you for gilding me, kind stranger.

I would like for all to bring up the cost of implementing NRC across the country - when discussing the same with folks who insist that the exercise has no religious or communal angle - and strictly a logistical viewpoint:

Of these 603M, 37% voted for BJP, that is 223M people.

You can estimate that some 20M voted for them because of Pulwama and Pakistan narrative. Another 20M voted for them because ""divilapment"" promise. And maybe another 10-20M voted because there was no credible opposition.

So really, you can say that the actual number of frothing-at-the-mouth Hindu bigots who voted for Hindutva would be about 150M. Not a minority, but not the overwhelming majority the mainstream narrative might make you feel.

3463,"Seeming paradoxesI have been anti-BJP and anti-Hindutva for over 10 years. I have been active in social media and quite often I had the misfortune of being trolled and confronted by right-wing elements. I still am against Hindutva, which is a curry version of Nazism. But today, I shall speak about those who are not from that bastion and I shall try to dispell a few myths about the bastion I am associated with. Some will clap seeing a die-hard left-winger being not critical of right-wing for the first time and some will try to call it self-hatred or self-loathing. Anyway, what matters to me is to be with truth, instead of being in a group. So, here I go...

&#x200B;

* It is generally perceived that the right-wing folks are uneducated, hooligans and they are crass. This is true but it is not just those who are promoters of Hindutva who are vile. Those who are anti-Modi are not necessarily polished and educated. There are a similar number of crass and bigoted people even in the anti-Modi camp. They oppose Modi due to political reasons but otherwise, there is hardly any difference between them and the Bhakt. Anyway, some are Kejriwal Bhakt and some are Gandhi-dynasty Bhakt. Sexist, uneducated, unscrupulous, they bare their fangs at the slightest opposition and criticism. It took me some time but eventually, I understood that a person's political affiliation, especially in a country like India, has very little to do with the person's actual character. He may be-anti-Modi but he can yet be sexist. He may be anti-Modi but he can yet be casteist.  He may be anti-Modi but he may still dislike Muslims and Christians. The affiliation has little to do with defending the constitution or democracy or secularism. People take sides in a match and a match is a power-struggle. 
* Secularism has become a cuss word in India. It can be said that this was done by the Hindutva promoters. But we, the non-Hindutva folks, the so-called seculars are no less to be blamed for the demise of secularism in India. A lot of people jump on to the bandwagon of secularism without caring a dime for secularism. They not only do not know what is secularism, but they also do not even care to know. Secularism is a tool for them to meet political ends. In their heart and mind, they are deeply in favour of their religious code of conduct. If they would not have been at the receiving end of Hindutva, they would have had never associated with secularism. But they need the label of secularism. So, even though they do not accept any secular values, they use secularism as a shield. For them, secularism means- ""Don't criticize our religion and our community. We will do what our religious leaders and our holy text prescribe"".  They may uphold the banner of secularism but at the same time they do not want gender equality, they do not want equal rights for LGBT community, they do not want uniform civil code. They have full faith in the conspiracy theories such that Kashmiri Pundits ran away from Kashmir out of their own will or Osama is still alive and is in USA or BJP had a hand in 26/11 or the train in Godhra caught fire on its own. They are not secular. They do not want real secularism. They have a perverted meaning of secularism. Secularism is a toilet-paper for them that they need now but when they won't need it, they would flush it down. These are the pseudo-seculars. It is because of them, that a true secular gets a bad name. 
* Left-wing politics also resorts to appeasement. Not calling spade a spade is in a way what appeasement is. Left-wing politicians and activists blatantly overlook reality. One of them is Arundhati Roy. At some point in time, I really liked her stance against fascism. But she went on to say once that Pakistani Army never killed its own people by completely and deliberately ignoring the world's second-biggest genocide. I feel very ashamed of liking her once upon a time. If a person is against the truth, no matter which wing he or she belongs to or how well educated the person is, the person is a liar. While I am a Marxist and a socialist, I prefer not to be part of a group that cannot look into the eyes of truth.

To be very frank, when it comes to Indian politics, I have eventually come to a point where it is not judicious to be a follower of any ideology, any leader and be part of any party or group. They are all opportunists. It is better to be an independent thinker than to be associated with those who have no qualms for equality, secularism, decency and the courage to tell the truth.

How do I explain it, not only I feel burning sensation in my mouth and chest but it also feels uncomfortable after eating & I have a hard time digesting it. Maybe it’s because of genetics. By spice I don’t mean just chilli but other spices too.

Back in home, all things are cooked without spices. Wedding ceremonies become a nightmare sometimes. Fortunately, I’ve a sweet tooth to make up for it and enjoy sweet things in general. 

After 12th I moved out and went to Kota for medical preparation. And food in my hostel was absolute nightmare (but average according to others), I suffered from acidity & sickness the entire year. Situation didn’t improve all even in my college life with the limited things I can eat. Also, I can’t eat outside with the few friends I have, unless it’s McDonald’s or KFC, which is rare since most of time they hang out, they always prefer dinner at some restaurant instead. Eating just Hakka noodles & salad isn’t worth it.

Edit: *I’ve read that our taste buds and nerves use various proteins (called TRP channels) to detect various substances that give most spices their distinctive taste. Most of these proteins are activated by many different spices. Our spice tolerance depends on our genetics, people have mutations of these proteins which influence our final sensation of spices since most food have blend of different spices. People who have TRPV1 protein mutated they’re less susceptible to capsaicin in chillies (chemical compound that causes burning sensation after eating chilli).*",1579837719.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,25,27

I'm losing a lot of weight I was already skinny physically I'm become weaker by the day I can feel it

I can't even stop crying I cry whenever I go to toilet

To top it all of My parents told me they don't wish a son like me to their worst enemy.

I've become puny

So please anyone prior experience to running away please suggest some cities where I can do some retail Jobs or anything.

I am planning to buy a laptop (refurbished ones okay too). My budget is around 30k INR. I currently have Lenovo Thinkpad E430 which I dearly love but after 7 years it has given up. I would definitely love to have another Thinkpad but they are pretty expensive these days. 

I don't like bigger laptops. I have mentioned my preferred specifications below:

- 13' screen
- Processor: confused between Intel or AMD
- Basic graphics card would suffice
- Backlit keyboard would be nice but I don't mind normal ones too.
- If MS Office is included that would be great too.
- Memory: 4 GB 
- Storage: 500 GB 
- Good battery life

My usuage is pretty minimal:

- Reading/writing
- light programming
- light gaming

Anything you would suggest? I was thinking about ordering from Amazon/Flipkart through EMI payment. How is your experience so far.

3553,"Question about freelancer rates.I frequently use Upwork to hire freelancers such as writers and web developers. I'm often surprised at the rates people request and expect. There are very few people on that platform who seem willing to work for under $5. And a lot of English speaking people charge $10-20 even $30 per hour. I recently had one turn down an offer of $10/hr which would have been $200/ mo ongoing. 

If a freelancer makes $400-$500 USD per month, this is like 30,000 Ru.  When I look it up, it looks like doctors make that much. And when I look it up, it seems like you can rent a really nice apartment for less than that much. 

So it seems to me that  one could enjoy a pretty good lifestyle over there on $400-500/month. Minimum wage in California is $11/hr. So it's hard for me to understand why it's not a win / win to hire someone in India for around that much when the cost of living is much much lower.  

I think the Upwork platform might be driving up the cost, since they take a percentage.

My questions are, are these assumptions correct?  Are the labor prices on Upwork inflated? Is speaking English such a valuable commodity over there that one can charge doctor rates? Is there a better platform where this is less of an issue?

A minority of vegetarians are strict-vegetarians, not eating any animal (by)product, usually for ethical reasons (veganism).

If indian vegetarians are lacto-vegetarians, then that means that they don’t eat egg. But at least here in Europe, eggs are everywhere, especially in cakes and cookies and everything sweet.

I have some ideas to make this debate to the points. These ideas seem impossible but are not. Ofcourse even if we try to make it happen, they won't agree to it, because they cannot stand the truth.  

• Get Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht in the same room with Ramachandra Guha, Azad, Sadaf Jafar, Kanhaiya, Dhruv Rathee, etc.  

• Exclude TV journalists. Bik gaye hai ye log.  

• Have a team from Altnews or some expert Google users who know how to search for stuff on the internet. To immediately fact check Modi, Shah and Ajay Bisht's statements and if it's false, prove it to them on the spot. If it's true, I'm sure we can find something to counter it.

## Tl;dr

On 22 January 2020, Justice Rajiv Sahai Endlaw of the Delhi High Court heard arguments by the Indian Journalists Union (IJU) and the Culture Workers Support Trust regarding their impleadment in the defamation suit filed by influential artist, Subodh Gupta seeking removal of Instagram posts and news reports containing anonymous allegations of sexual harassment against him. Read more about the case [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/delhi-hc-directs-subodh-gupta-to-respond-to-impleadment-application-filed-by-indian-journalists-union-and-allows-scene-and-herd-to-contest-anonymously-for-now/). Senior Advocate, Ritin Rai and Advocate, Shreya Munoth appearing for IJU emphasized that news reports cannot be de-indexed without providing journalists an opportunity to defend their reportage.  They further submitted there was a distinction between merely republishing defamatory allegations and reporting on them. They also highlighted the harm caused by de-indexing of news reports from Google search engine results by comparing it to removal of a book from the shelves of booksellers.

## Private lawsuits also affect press freedom

At the beginning of the hearing, Endlaw J. noted that this was not a Public Interest Litigation and asked the counsels for IJU why they should be impleaded in a private defamation suit. In response, the counsels explained that private defamation suits can also violate the media's freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) and journalists’ right to carry on their profession under Article 19(1)(g). In support of this proposition, the counsels cited a recent decision of the German Constitutional Court where it was held that prior to directing de-indexing of any online content from search engine results, courts must consider the impact of such de-indexing on the freedom of speech and expression of the publisher even in disputes under private law.

## Is being de-indexed from Google really that big a deal?

During the previous hearing, the Court had passed an interim injunction and directed Google to de-index URLs hosting defamatory content against the plaintiff from their search engine results. Since this was the scope of the interim relief granted, Endlaw J. asked the counsels whether de-indexing from Google search engine results is a problem if the articles are still available on the website of the news publication. In response to this, the counsels explained that Google was the most commonly used search engine and removal from its search results would make it very difficult for individuals to access the news reports. To highlight the importance of search engines, the counsels compared removing a news article from Google search results to removing a book from the shelves of booksellers.  

## Reportage =/= republication

A large part of the hearing was devoted to discussing whether the press can have a better right than the person running the HerdandScene Instagram account to publish allegations against the plaintiff. Endlaw J. quizzed the counsels on whether republication of allegations which have been found to be prima facie defamatory by journalists is permissible. The counsels appearing for IJU clarified that there was a distinction between merely republishing allegations and reporting on them. They submitted that journalists have qualified privilege to report on the existence of allegations even if the allegation itself is unverified.

## Of “errors” and their inevitability

The counsels for IJU drew the Court’s attention to various news articles whose removal has been sought by Subodh Gupta that either don’t refer to him at all or only reference his case briefly while making a broader point. To illustrate the problem, Mr. Rai cited [**this article**](https://www.firstpost.com/living/metoo-india-kochi-biennale-foundation-drops-inquiry-into-sexual-misconduct-allegations-against-riyas-komu-6348811.html) by FirstPost about the Kochi Biennale dropping its inquiry into sexual harassment charges agains another artist, Riyaz Komu which was included in the list of defamatory articles submitted by Subodh Gupta. However, a bare perusal of the article reveals that the article doesn’t refer to Subodh Gupta at all. Subodh Gupta’s lawyers argued that this was an error but such overbroad and unnecessary censorship is inevitable because Subodh Gupta has not impleaded any of the media houses or journalists who could have defended the news reports and provided a counter viewpoint to the Court.

## Need for anonymity in the art industry

Senior Advocate, Jayna Kothari appeared on behalf of the Culture Workers Support Trust and argued in favour of the Trust’s impleadment since the defamation suit raised important questions of law about non-availability of formal greivance redressal mechanisms within the art world and the need to preserve anonymity in cases of sexual harassment where there is possibility of retaliation.  

## The plaintiff’s stance

Senior Advocate, Sandeep Sethi appearing for Subodh Gupta stated that the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013  imposes bar on media reporting and argued that if journalists are not allowed to write about sexual harassment allegations even when a formal complaint is made, how can journalists be allowed to write about anonymous allegations made on social media? He insisted that his client’s right to due process, privacy and reputation had been seriously prejudiced by anonymous defamatory allegations. He stated that the content of the news reports was defamatory on the face of it, and even the journalists who had written these articles could not oppose their de-indexing because they had not complied with norms laid down by the Press Council of India.

The next date of hearing in the case is 4 February 2020 and the counsels for IJU and Culture Workers Support Trust will make their rejoinder arguments then.

I wanted to be an IAS officer so was determined to take  Arts but parents told me to take Science because of career opportunities and to do IAS afterwards as i belong to general category so the probability is very less to qualify. To be honest i have no interest in science at all. So this year i couldn't qualify jee. My parents got tensed as we don't have they dont have money to feed in the private colleges and i dont want a drop cause this is not my passion. My parents says to do Btech because even if i couldn't qualify the exam an alternative will be there. Being a general category middle class this is so much irritating. I wanted to do Bsc in chemistry cause i am somewhat better in it but my relatives are denying it. Here everyone thinks that you are a loser if you couldn't qualify mains. My mom says if you cant qualify JEE then forget about IAS. My father wants that i should do LLB everyone has different opinion and i am struck in between. Is this my fault?

3884,"Seeking guidance: Which scooter has the most comfortable pillion \ passenger seat for Pune \ desi roads?? (more details in comments)My SO is about to buy a new 2 wheeler. She has her mind set on the Suzuki Access (125cc, I guess).

She currently rides on a very old, yet very functional Hero Pleasure. (bought 7 , 8 years ago I guess).

I do not know how to ride a 2 wheeler at all. I have no idea about their technical specifications, their performance, their prices, their maintenance or general up keep. 

I have read about these things, and have combed through lots of websites & blogs, spoken to friends and relatives - and that's the extent of my strictly academic knowledge. 

**(I also know about the impending BS-VI vs BS-IV compliance\manufacturing detail - and the effect it will have on prices of scooters - but any more insight & tips in this department shall be highly appreciated.)** 

However, the most important question is: since i'll be forever plonked on the pillion seat behind her - which scooters in India have a comfortable passenger seat for my fat ass. 

i'm 5'10, a bit on the chunky side and have a really big bottom. Usually i'm frozen in fear every time I ride on a scooter or a bike. 

But i'm assuming that for most purposes and most definitely for short distances & journeys - we'll have to \ it makes sense to use the scooter (and the new one which will arrive soon).

***Additional Notes:***
 
She will use the scooter to drive to work daily in Pune - which is about a 8km (~10 kms) ride one way. 
She's 5'4, has a light frame and at least 20kgs lighter than I am! Riding with me at the back is a task for us both!!

add along general rides for running errands & such - so approx. 80 kms a week worth of driving. 

We work in completely separate areas (and I drive my car to work) - so the duration of time i'll be riding pillion behind her is fairly limited, but it shall be a factor nevertheless. 

Any suggestions & feedback of your experiences shall be most welcome! Have a great week ahead, y'all! :)",1579765648.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,12,11

&#x200B;

If you are interested about my project, here some information about it. I am from the Netherlands   and am now in my final year of secondary school. As the last big project we have to make before we go to university we were free to choose whichever subject we liked,  and spend at least 80 hours working on this per person with a group of 3.  We chose to make a project about the difference in digitalisation between India and the Netherlands. For example the difference between the governmental actions, Digital India with you guys, and a  project to fund innovating businesses in the Netherlands. The survey is mainly to compare what we found with the reality, did the differences actually occur, or did some people write about it and everybody just assumed it as  the truth.

3962,"Kerala Chief Minister duty-bound to approach me: Governor Arif M. KhanNew Delhi: Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan has said that the Constitution gives him many options and he will take a decision at an appropriate time on Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan-led Left Democratic Front government moving the Supreme Court against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

“As far as I am concerned, the rules of duties are clear. It is already established how the Chief Minister is supposed to approach me. The Chief Minister is duty-bound to approach me before he passes any such order. My role is to see that the state works according to the rules. I am not claiming supremacy,” he told The Sunday Guardian.

Khan said it was his duty to ensure that the rule, law and Constitution were followed in letter and spirit in the state. “Also, it is my responsibility to ensure that the Constitutional machinery does not collapse,” he said.

“Be you ever so high, the law is above you. You have to respect the law. Once the President has given assent to a law, as Governor, I have the right to protect it. I am moving in a Constitutional way. I am not a rubber stamp,” said the Kerala Governor.

The plea filed by the Kerala government under Article 131 of the Constitution on disputes between Centre and states, stated that the CAA violates the right to equality under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, right to life under Article 21 and freedom to practice religion under Article 25. The Kerala Assembly also passed a resolution earlier demanding scrapping of the CAA, claiming that the Act, which was passed after following due process by Parliament, was unconstitutional.

Saying that “dissent is the essence of democracy”, Khan cited the Constitution to accuse the Pinarayi Vijayan government of violating the law on key issues like passing a resolution or challenging the CAA in the Supreme Court, without keeping him in the loop.

“I have no problem with the government, Opposition, or anybody holding a different view on CAA, NRC (National Register of Citizens) or NPR (National Population Register). Everyone is free. But my only point is the rules should be followed as stipulated by the Constitution,” he said.",1579714745.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,5,13

3981,"An interesting story on Democracy in IndiaIn 1956 JBS Haldane the famous biochemist who worked on ""Origins of Life"" and other interesting stuff left England and became citizen of India. He had a bitter rivalry with his own government.

After a few years a certain newspaper called him ""Citizen of the world"", this was his interesting reply 

""No doubt I am in some sense a citizen of the world. But I believe with Thomas Jefferson that one of the chief duties of a citizen is to be a nuisance to the government of his state. As there is no world state, I cannot do this. On the other hand, I can be, and am, a nuisance to the government of India, which has the merit of permitting a good deal of criticism, though it reacts to it rather slowly. I also happen to be proud of being a citizen of India, which is a lot more diverse than Europe, let alone the U.S.A, the U.S.S.R or China, and thus a better model for a possible world organisation. It may of course break up, but it is a wonderful experiment. So, I want to be labeled as a citizen of India.""

There has been a major synthesis of Islam and Hinduism in India over the years. These mutual influences are not just limited to music, dress, architecture, language, food, etc. but also affected the religions themselves.

Sufism was influenced by Hinduism and in turn influenced the bhakti movement.

[Kabir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabir) and [Dadu Dayal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dadu_Dayal) were Muslims who are revered as Hindu saints. Kabir was critical of caste as well as Muslim formalism and tried to syncretize the best aspects of both religions.

[Guru Nanak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guru_Nanak) cited Kabir as his spiritual teacher and travelled with a Hindu and a Muslim as his two companions.

The great Marathi poet and sant of the bhakti movement, [Tukaram Maharaj](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukaram), wrote in a poem:

>First among the great names is Allah, never forget to respect it.  
Allah is verily one, the prophet is verily one.  
There Thou art one, there Thou art one, There Thou art one, O friend.  
There is neither I nor thou

Shivaji's grandfather [Maloji Bhonsle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maloji_Bhosale) prayed at the dargah of the sufi saint, Shah Sharif of Ahmednagar. He believed he was blessed with his two sons after praying there, so he named them Shahaji and Sharifji. Shahaji was Shivaji's father.

[Muslim Civilization in India, Ch. IX](http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00islamlinks/ikram/part1_09.html), S M Ikram, Columbia University Press, 1964.

If certain sections of the society really cared about Indian culture, even just Hindu culture, they'd treat Indian Islam with reverence. By ignoring these aspects of our culture and history, they have reduced Islam and Hinduism to mere political tools to be exploited for their own personal gains.

It is also very suspect, and frankly insulting, that they consider all forms of Buddhism to be part of Hinduism, even those of Tibetan Buddhism and the sects of Japanese Buddhism, although their mutual influences with Hinduism proper has been very limited. On the other hand, they consider Islam a ""foreign religion"" although Indian Islam cannot be completely untwined from Hinduism and other Indian religions: they have so much of a shared heritage.

India thrived because of the mutual appreciation and influences in religions, despite their significant differences.",1579706285.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,18,75

But the legislator also mentioned Nation-wide NRC during discussion on CAB, which was very interesting. The Prime Minister himself has mentioned  that there's absolutely no link between the two and how ""there's been no talk about it"", the legislators discussed Nation-wide NRC while passing CAB.

4252,"Most effective way to deal with Indian clients.Hi there.

I was hoping to trouble you for advice about how to deal Indian clients.

I'm a Sri Lankan criminal lawyer practicing in Canada.  My office is in an area with a large number of immigrants from South East Asia.

I don't want to generalize, but I've had some issues with Indian and Pakistani clients.  For one, despite being in an area with many Indian and Pakistani client, I've only retained very few Indian and Pakistani clients.

Despite only being retained by very few Indian clients,  I get a lot of calls and even visits from Indian individuals.  These people often try and take up as much time as possible and ask loads of questions but will refuse to sign up or pay for anything.  Because they're a large community in my area, they actually interfere with my practice by taking and energy time away from paying customers.   After many such visits, I've began to realize that they were only after free advice and not interested in buying anything.

Of course people of other races call for free advice from time to time as well.  But they are in 99% of cases honest about it, and polite about not taking up too much of my time.  Unfortunately the opposite is true for nearly 90% of Indian callers.

Also, I noticed that the few Indian customers I do get are demanding and not very good at keeping up with payment.

Of course this hasn't been the case with all Indian clients, some have been absolutely stellar.  However, it has been the case with way too many of them to the point where I realized I need a better strategy to deal with  it.  Of course, this only seems to apply to people who have immigrated from India or Pakistan relatively recently or people who haven't really integrated well to Canadian culture.  Indians who have integrated to Canadian culture are a joy to work with.  And because at least one person is bound to say it - yes I understand generalizations, not all Indians etc etc.

I realize this sounds like a rant  but it's not.  The reason I'm here is because I realized that there must be some of you who run service oriented businesses in India.   If I'm getting a disproportionate amount of this behavior from Indian clients, Indian businesses must get it alot from their clients.  My question is how do you deal with it?  How do you run an effective business under these conditions?

Do businesses in India have a method for spotting and  weeding out individuals who are looking for free advice and just wasting your time?   Do businesses in india have a strategy for dealing with difficult or demanding clients.   What strategies to Indian businesses employ to make sure payment schedule are met on time.   And finally, I'm starting to suspect that the main way to get Indian clients is through referrals through someone they know, is this suspicion accurate or is there another way to market effectively to Indian clients.

Basically what's the best way for a business owner to serve Indian clients without losing his mind?",1579669104.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,11,19

4265,"""The youth have an appointment with the future""**""Memorialisation is an inherently political process that can be utilised for the reclamation of violated rights or appropriated to serve malevolent purposes that can entrench impunity and subvert fundamental rights.""**

Going through an article I was reading for my ""Memory and Politics"" class I stumbled upon this quote which not only highlights the current issue which we are facing in India but also reiterates the importance of the youth in constructing a narrative. With specific reference to the RSS (and BJP), the rise of Hindutva, and the current CAA and NRC, we must reclaim our history for ourselves and not succumb to the rhetoric used by Modi and Shah. What we can see is that they use ""historical injustices"" against marginalised communities in our neighbouring countries as well as referencing the mass exodus of Kashmiri pundits 30 years ago to create a narrative which promotes exclusionary beliefs and enables any sort of -isms. 

Coming to the point, if we look at memory in such an objective manner and are able to look at the exclusionary rhetoric as simply a perspective which can be constructed, then similarly this exact tactic is what can be used to combat their exclusionary tactics. There is a sharp distinction between remembering to forget and remembering to not forget. For Modi, Shah, and all his cronies, the inhuman treatment of the Kashmiri Pundits is a reason to oppress. They never want it to repeat to **their community**. Conversely, we have the ability as a generation who is distinctly apart from it to look at as something which should never repeat to **any community**. We can memorialise and we can remember history the way we want to, and by reclaiming our history to look at India for the secular nation it started out wanting to be, it can be a solid stand against any narrative posed by Modi-Shah. 

While none of what I am saying might sound extremely novel or complex, the reason why it is important is because the political ""right"" will always unite under fear mongering/hatred, whereas the left will never completely unite over the smallest differences. There is need for solidarity especially when confronting such a categorically xenophobic narrative which might seem objective in nature, but the way to combat it is by uniting under a narrative which transcends above that. 

Sorry for sounding too idealistic, just food for thought.

(1) A promoter shall not accept a sum more than ten percent of the cost of the apartment, plot, or building as the case may be, as an advance payment or an application fee, from a person without first entering into a written agreement for sale with such person and register the said agreement for sale, under any law for the time being in force."" So if I am going to a developer to book an under-construction flat, do I need to pay 10 % of flat price as an advance+stamp duty as per local percentage+registration fee altogether and leave it to developer to deal with stamp duty payment on my behalf or I just need to pay 10% of booking fee and when the certificate of occupancy would be issued and the flat is ready for me to move in at that time I should pay stamp duty while getting the title transferred to my name? And one more question the said text from act says that 10% of booking should be paid while registering agreement of sales so how does it work? Where do I need to go for that? By registering agreement of sale aren't we transferring the title of under-construction flat therefore need to pay stamp duty while booking a flat?

I am going to be visiting India soon for a business trip. I will be meeting up with our business friend, which is the reason for my visit. We will be in New Delhi, and I just have some random miscellaneous questions and I would enjoy talking to actual Indians instead of reading someone's travel blog. Above all, I want to make sure I'm not disrespectful to anyone.

Firstly, I am interested in doing some photography of my time here, both of the incredible buildings and of the culture. Is it considered disrespectful to do what we call ""street photography"" which is essentially taking pictures of the things, buildings, and people while walking around? What is the locals attitude towards a white guy like me walking around taking photographs?

Secondly, what are some good places to visit near New Delhi? I believe we will be going to the taj Mahal, and I would also like to go to red fort, humayuns tomb, etc. I know these are touristy, but I'm coming across the world and would like to see them.

4384,"IAF says – “Ready for a 2-front war”. Really?*By: Kartikeya Semwal* 

It is good to see that IAF (Indian Airforce) is working hard to move from strength to strength by acquiring different types of fighter planes, transport aircrafts and different types helicopters. But this doesn’t mean that it is ready to fight any type of war, especially when it is about fighting a two-front war on western and eastern fronts. Though IAF has been carrying out war games, operational exercises, joint exercises with friendly countries but it doesn’t mean that it is ready and well equipped for a two-front war. 

The most important point is still the same- lack of enough jet fighters to complete full squadron-strength of 45. We all know that the last of Mig-21s were retired a few months back in 2019 that had brought down IAF’s squadron strength to 33. But recently, with retiring of Mig-27 3rd generation fighters lovingly called “Bahadur” by IAF, the current squadron strength is down to a dangerous low of 28. And if that was not enough then here me out loud- IAF intends to retire upgraded jaguars and Mig-29s in the next 10 years. 

&#x200B;

[Mig-27 or \\""Bahadur\\"" of IAF in action. ](https://preview.redd.it/6k50itvjm5c41.jpg?width=647&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eaa407e1c20598e7d4a17f462363e2a915457298)

So IAF’s statement of “we are ready to fight a two-front war” completely undermines itself. No doubt our Air Force chief and our brave pilots are patriotic and ready for challenges, but that doesn’t works when it comes to fighting a war. Numbers do matter, especially when you have a neighbour like China which is continuously upgrading its armed forces. China’s PLA-Airforce is working night & day to add over 600 aircrafts including fighter jets in the next decade (10 years). Most of these are combat jets and are of 4th and 5th generation. Not to mention the J-10, J-15, J-20 and J-31. 

&#x200B;

[From Top Left to Right: J-10, J-15, J-20 & J-31    ](https://preview.redd.it/yqaxuhuzm5c41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7ab367f8aa1963a0b870c41f34dafe1cbe2ad915)

Once they get those number of fighters up and flying, they will gain control over not just all of Asia but also over the Pacific region, which is of great importance for sea-trade, international business and rich in resources. Now we all know that IAF is acquiring 40 Tejas Mk-1 fighters followed by 43 Tejas Mk-1As totalling to 83 combat jets of 4th generation. There have been talks about IAF might buy 114 Tejas Mk-II or MWF but when & in how many years? Even if we consider that they will do so in the next 10 years, but is that enough? Not at all.  

&#x200B;

[Above: LCA Tejas & Tejas Mk-II or MWF Concept Design](https://preview.redd.it/pcxo7karn5c41.jpg?width=550&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd90c5372ab0246e05890c06724efb0a92d9ac4b)

Rafale considered as 4.5+ generation fighter that has the calibre to take out 5th generation fighters of China (J-20 & J-31) are being acquired by IAF but only 36, and that too only by 2026. Now the question arises- what it China attacks India in the next 1-3 years?

The answer is, if that happens IAF will be doomed. Now it is clear that action is needed & at a fast pace. The one and only solution to increase the number of IAF’s fighting squadrons to take on a two-front war & ‘fight will full force’ is- ask HAL to increase the production of LCA Tejas jets & buy at least 5-6 squadrons (80 to 98) of a new jet. But if they don’t want to buy it then they should at least take the same number of fighter planes on lease for the next 10 years. IAF has already zeroed in on Saab’s Gripen E & Boeing’s F/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III. Both are on par with each other and both are 4.5 generation fighters. Getting any one of them will not only improve IAF’s firepower, but it will also make up the numbers and nullify the psychological advantage China’s PLA Airforce has over us.

&#x200B;

[F\/A-18 Super Hornet Block-III being offered to India](https://preview.redd.it/6a5h8hbdo5c41.jpg?width=739&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4a4aa08ea284e27a6b4d6227bfa40073af74b8f)

 Meanwhile, India can continue design-development & production of Tejas Mk-II or the MWF (Medium Weight Fighter) that will be a 4th+ generation twin-engine fighter and will form the backbone of IAF in future. They are already carrying out induction of Tejas Mk-1s & Mk-1As but that too needs to be speeded up to improve the numbers. If I were to choose, I would go for Super Hornet Block-III. My reasons are simple, 

1. It will bring a whole new set of technologies, hardwares, softwares, missiles and ammunition. India will also get access to much-needed powerful engine & its technology that HAL, DRDO & ADA have failed to make on their own over the years. 

2. Also, Super Hornet is battle-proven & its war-fighting abilities are unknown to both Pakistan & China. 

3. Another reason is that this fighter jet is not present in either Asia or in the Pacific region. Thus, giving an advantage to IAF and disadvantage to China coz they don’t know much about it. 

4. One more reason is that it is cost-effective and IAF pilots have already flown & tested it and are satisfied with its performance.  

5. Last but not least. India can buy 2 Super Hornets for the price of 1 Rafale fighter jet being offered by France. So the numbers do matter. 

If this happens, then IAF will actually ‘be ready & fit’ to fight a two-front war if needed. Now I leave it up to all of you reading this article as to what should be done to address the problem of IAF’s depleting squadrons so they can match our eastern enemy.

4444,"TIL the last Kakatiya Ruler of Bastar State was shot dead on the steps of his palace by Indian police in 1966This is quite odd given the fact that many Indian royals (and many of them fairly questionable people based on their unrelenting support of the British) ended up leading comfy lives as members of the Rajya Sabha (and even the Lok Sabha sometimes). [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pravir_Chandra_Bhanj_Deo) is what Wikipedia has to say:

>**Pravir, King of Bastar** (*Pravir Chandra Bhanj Dev* 25 June 1929 – 25 March 1966) was the first [Odia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odia_people) ruler and 20th Maharaja of [Bastar state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastar_state) who was shot in 1966 for championing the cause of his subjects. He fought for rights of the tribal people. He represented the [Jagdalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdalpur) Vidhan Sabha constituency in the undivided [Madhya Pradesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhya_Pradesh) Legislative Assembly following the [general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_election) of 1957.  
>  
>He was the last [Kakatiya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakatiya) ruler of Bastar. He was born on 25 June 1929 and was educated at [Rajkumar College, Raipur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rajkumar_College,_Raipur). He succeeded to throne on 28 October 1936. He was married to Rajkumari Shubhraj Kumari of [Patan, Rajasthan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patan,_Rajasthan) daughter of Raj Rishi Rao Saheb Udaya Singhji and Rani Trilokya Raj Lakshmi of Patan on 4th July 1961.   
>  
>He was immensely popular among his people, as he took up the  cause of the local tribal people, and provided political leadership  against exploitation of natural resources of the region, and corruption  in land reforms. On 25 March 1966 he was killed in police firing at the  steps of his own palace at [Jagdalpur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagdalpur) along with many of the royal court. The official death toll was twelve including the king, with twenty  wounded; the police had fired sixty one rounds. The district magistrate  was reported as stating that Pravir Chandra was leading armed [adivasis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adivasi) against the police, who fired in self-defence.

Some have gone even deeper and spun this into a conspiracy theory, implying that this was a hostile takeover of the Bastar region by outside interests. Since the region was already part of independent India, did the ""outside interests"" have some connection with the Maoists who immediately after this assassination, became involved in the politics of the region? This is a big rabbit hole for those seeking to investigate.",1579620378.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,1,45

2. Ahmediyas etc weren't included because they aren't opressed for their religion.
3. Also Ahmediyas don't want to leave their country only want things to get better.
4. That ALL non-muslims want to leave their respective countries and come to India due to this opression and that's what the CAA provides for.

4552,"Four ways how the 2020 budget can promote the digital economy and rights### Tl;dr

In the fast paced digital world the mantra of, ""move past and break things"" is a fading chant. Today, for a need to -- pause, consider and plan ahead. Here an important, annual moment is provided as the Union Government prepares it's annual budget. Yesterday, we submitted comments to the Ministry of Finance how it can account for the digital economy and rights in four important ways. These will protect your privacy, security and right to internet access. What's more? They will help fuel innovation and health in the digital sector! 

### How many zeroes are there in a trillion ? 

The Union Government envisions the digital economy as a trillion dollar opportunity by 2025 ([link](https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1565407)). These are big numbers. Such ambitious projections are often found on the basis of a robust growth in the number of internet connections in India. The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) notes in it's latest subscription report for November, 2019 for these to be close to 661 million ([link](https://main.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/PR_No.09of2020_0.pdf)).  

Users of the internet are central to the story of how the digital economy in India is growing. Focussing on them, we have made 4 clear recommendations to the Ministry of Finance for the Union Budget 2020-21. 

* These are *first* growing regulatory capacity in TRAI and the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MEITY). While TRAI is considering Net Neutrality enforcement, MEITY should be adequately resourced for the institutional preparation of a Data Protection Authority. 
* *Second*, we need an online and digital environment which is safe and secure for all of us. This can only be done by rationalizing the present budgetary allocations on cyber security which are principally earmarked to the Ministry of Home Affairs towards other bodies such as the Fin-Cert. 
* *Third*, let us not waste money on illegal and unconstitutional surveillance programmes. While expenditures such as those on the Social Media Communication Hub or the NATGRID should not be made since they are illegal per se, for other programmes, funding should not be alloacated without a clear underlying law, a privacy compliant assessment and the necessary safeguards. 
* *Finally,* we also call for a recognition  of the economic harms caused by internet shutdowns.

However, a friend who works at one of the largest semiconductor companies said that a lot of the digital transformation initiatives deployed in his company did not have any ROI at all. Basically, it added to the costs. 

Things like basic predictive models for quality and production control have been in use for over a decade. But the recent surge in consulting and IT service companies making AI offerings made me feel that a true revolution is underway. That doesn't appear to be the case.

4600,"Parents of r/india, what is your experience regarding safety in non-ISOFIX infant car seats in Indian cars?Hey everyone!

I'll soon be having a child and we're in the process of deciding which car to buy. So far, we have zeroed in on the *Tata Tiago automatic transmission model. It falls in our budget, has all the required features but lacks one important one, ISOFIX mounts.

So, what has been your experience with child car seats that were of the non-ISOFIX standard? I saw some videos on YouTube that showed the process of installing such an infant seat on Indian cars (it was a Maruti Swift in the video IIRC) and the process didn't seem to be that time taking as I had imagined.

However, what is your take regarding the safety that such installed seats have to offer? Do you feel at peace after using those seats while seating your child? Has anyone been in a panic braking situation and found the seats to provide adequate safety?

Thanks!",1579592898.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,14

Please feel free to amend/remove this post as appropriate, but do let me know so that I do not make the same mistake(s) in the future. Also if you suspect any mistakes/flaws in my analysis or there are things which I have missed, please let me know.*

# Introduction

For some reason, there hasn't been much of a research into CBSE's grading and moderation policies, despite its 'moderation' system being fundamentally flawed. Here, I try to take a deeper look into what's really going on. There have been some reports on this (like [this one](https://www.thequint.com/news/india/cbse-isc-cheated-students-with-mark-moderation) and [this](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/education/news/CBSE-Std-XII-scoring-shows-sudden-spikes/articleshow/20582997.cms)), but surprisingly few for such a serious issue in my view.

I first realised this when reading Debarghya Das' interesting analysis on his CBSE and ICSE data (link had to be removed due to automoderator), wherein he showed clear evidence of nonsensical grading by both boards. Naturally, I wanted to try this out myself, and it took me some Python scripts (sources listed), hours of web scraping using tmux and more hours of Excel (lesson learned - don't use it for large data), but the results were really surprising and made the effort worth it.

# The statistical evidence

For example, this is the graph for the third subject in the 2014 boards:

&#x200B;

[Students' marks in their third subject in the 2014 CBSE Class 12 exams. Source: Leaderboard \(me\)](https://preview.redd.it/m18diylx82c41.png?width=997&format=png&auto=webp&s=15323bdff2c0b8e0f204be47e48f5a087b8244c7)

It is immediately obvious that the results make no statistical sense. Firstly, the graph resembles a multimodal distribution, which is in complete odds with what such a graph should *look* like (it should be normal/Gaussian).

Secondly, take a look at the 'modes'/'peaks'. There are four: at 0,33,\~46-53 and 95. It is not too hard to explain how two of the peaks came about:

* 0 is for students who never showed up for the exams.
* 33 is the minimum pass mark

But what about 46 and 95? These require a somewhat deeper explanation:

* Marks in the ranges \[46,53\] are often scored by students in the sciences who score full in the practical but struggle to pass in the theory (and hence get 23/70 - pass mark). This is more evident when the graphs for Subject 3 (mostly Physics) and 4 (mostly Chemistry) are taken.
* And 95? That's the subject for the next section.

# The faulty moderation policy

CBSE's moderation policy was first initiated in 1992 as a response to them creating sets. Their objective was to account for potentially varying difficulties in sets. That makes sense, right?

But all that CBSE does is simply raise the marks of students by some amount *k*. Let the original mark of the student be *m*. Then the naïve way would be to add *k* marks to give a sum of *m*\+*k*. But then this raises the possibility of a student scoring beyond 100. So what CBSE has done is to cap students' marks to 95 *unless* they actually got more than 95. That is,

*m* = max(min(*m+k*,95),*m*)

So this essentially means that a student who has actually scored 95 and another who scored 95-*k* would end up getting the same score 95 in the end. **This is unfair**.

What makes this even sadder is that CBSE was on the verge of ending this back in 2017, but it was unfortunately hit with a court case by the Delhi High Court that forced it to continue moderation that year.2018 (the year when I wrote the exams) was an interesting case - it was the first (and the only) time that they essentially abolished differential sets per region - everyone around the world, whether Delhi, All-India or Foreign - would receive the exact same questions. That was a very good idea to my eyes - that removed the primary motivation for having moderation in the first place (i.e, presence of sets). But unfortunately, moderation still persisted (we got 9 free marks in maths despite the paper being really straightforward), through at least it was uniform...

2019 marked the unfortunate return to differential sets (and going as far as differing questions within the same region) and potentially non-uniform moderation scales. This was perhaps due to the 2018 paper leaks, but sigh...

# Connecting with the (good) grading scale

In comparison, the grading system of CBSE is much better and actually logical (if perhaps controversial at times). CBSE grading is purely relative: it first takes all passed students in a subject and then ranks them: the top 1/8 gets A1, the next 1/8 gets A2, the next 1/8 gets B1, and so on, till the last 1/8th gets a D2 (pass). This system properly accounts for difficulty in questions between years, and is the only system that takes the faulty moderation policy into account correctly.

Using the scales, we can observe some interesting trends. Let's consider the grading curves:

* In 2016, |min(D1)-min(D2)| was exactly 2 in Mathematics. This does not make sense - considering that 33 is the past mark - unless over 12.5% of all candidates managed to earn 33 or 34. Clearly, students near the pass mark were given ""grace marks"". The same can be seen in Class 10 with Science and Mathematics for 2018 (where the difference was just 1!)
* Even with moderation applied, there is clear evidence that 2018 students in Mathematics had an advantage over their 2016 counterparts. Technically, if moderation was doing its job properly, then the cutoffs for each grade should be nearly the same. This is not the case (offset is the number of marks added in that year):

|*Grade cutoff (Mathematics)*|*2016-17 year (offset = +15)*|*2018-19 year (offset = +9)*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|A1|90|95|
|A2|76|84|
|B1|67|73|
|B2|57|63|
|C1|50|55|
|C2|44|46|
|D1|35|42|
|D2|33|33|

The ramifications for this could be that students who applied to universities that considered the mark and not the grade would have been affected adversely (Indian and I think Canadian universities follow this for example). The argument that 2018 students were somehow 'smarter' is not valid (the 2014 A1 cutoff was 94 for example), and the law of large numbers is enforceable here.

# What I want from them

Considering that I have sent a lot of emails to them and have got nothing from them, I am not hopeful that I will get what I want. But here's what I wish they do:

* Stop moderation. The grading scale handles many of the issues (i.e variations in difficulty) really well. Or, if you need to retain some sort of correction to students' marks, please do it in a statistically meaningful manner. Others know how to do it - the prime example being the SAT (whose task is actually much harder with the variety of sets that exist). Others like the IB, A-Levels and Scotland's (Advanced) Highers do it in a better way as well. Indeed, as I noted elsewhere,

>We start with capturing the marks obtained in a particular test administration (say the 2019 exams), and then convert its mark into one with a defined normal curve (my proposal is to set mean = 50/55), and finally use that as the basis for future test administrations. This is just like how standardised tests like the SAT work. In future test administrations, the distribution can be compared with that of the standardised curve and then curved to standardise the score. While it is doable in large subjects like Mathematics to force the curve to be the same due to the law of large numbers, the statistically better approach is to consider this with other factors before applying the adjustment to the standardised scale. *This is not moderation, however*. To start with, the adjustment is not purely linear. Marks can increase or decrease, the number of marks adjusted can vary, and it is not injective (i.e, multiple raw marks can map to the same scaled score). The SAT and most other standardised exams work on this principle, just that the raw and standardised marks both correspond to an integer inclusively between 0 and 100 in this case.  
>  
>For example, for a raw mark of 60, an easy paper might map that to a 55, while one might get a 65 or 70 for a harder one.

* Stop the practice of giving grace marks. Like if you need do that, why not set the pass mark to that lower number instead? After all, there will be that many students who have fallen just short of the pass mark; there is no need to pass them.
* Going further would deviate from this post (which focuses purely on the moderation aspect), but I have a lot more that I wish CBSE would do. Like doubling the portions (Class 11 + 12), adding a **H**igher tier for all subjects, and more. But **not** reducing the portion (as there were some media reports on it).

So I sent them a screenshot of the list [from this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_secularism) of Muslim majority secular states such as Turkey, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan (never in the news because they don't do Jihadi shit like Iran and Saudi) and even Syria even though it's dumb to call Syria secular for obvious reasons even though it *technically* is. The person said, Indonesia's supreme leader has never been a non-Muslim but neither has a Muslim in India ever been a PM and this shouldn't matter, we're not Hindu phobics, if the PM is Hindu it doesn't matter as long as he is a good guy, the religion of the PM is beyond question, their ideology isn't. He also said that Turkey is secular because of the EU which is a wrong claim, Turkey isn't a part of the EU yet though they want to be. He also said that the rest of the countries in the list combined have a population almost as much as Delhi. Again, not a well researched claim. Kazakhstan alone has a population of 18 Mil (Delhi is also 18.92 Mil) while Uzbekistan, Niger and Malaysia have higher populations than Delhi including many other such countries.

4813,"I've messed upI'm losing control over my life. Let me rephrase I already have. My degree seems endless. I committed some transgressions and my college wants to set a precedent. Hence I've been awarded the harshest punishment. I won't be graduating until I'm 25. The prospect of being dependent on my parents for this long a period terrifies me. I've been deserted by friends and relatives alike. The monotony of my existence is draining the life force from me. I haven't smiled in months.

My parents are accomodating but seeing them constantly worried about my future fills me with shame and detestation for myself.  My day is unproductive and I've little motivation to pursue my goals. There was a point when i was dynamic, effervescent. I thought i had the potential for greatness. That was years ago. I've been inundated with self-doubt, self-pity and a sporadic thought of ending my life. I realise that'd be idiotic. But there's another part of me that stoppage of my existence will be a relief to myself and people around me.



When I was a kid I nursed a desire to get married to a righteous woman and raise a child who I'd be proud of. This goal was rooted in the bitter ties I had with my father. He was dutiful but authoritarian. I wanted to be different. I yearned to be a father my child would look upto, his confidant and someone with whom conversations would flow. I now think none of that is even attainable. I've grown to become a short man with a grotesque face.

My insecurities scream at me and there's nothing I can do to tame them. Not only that but the sheer decadence of our society fills me with anxiety. Debauchery is becoming the norm. I too experience a desire to enjoy time with women in a romantic setting. But that's not to be.

This delay in graduation will impair my potential as an employee. It's a scar that i won't be able to erase. I keep staring at the ceiling, the fan rotating slowly and the silence utterly maddening.",1579509631.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,22,62

Ever since BJP has come to power, there has been systemic destruction of the nation's education system.  
Apart from few fancy Pradan Mantri Yojana's I honestly don't think BJP has done anything to improve the education system of the country. The latest attack of masked goons in JNU shows the condition of the Indian education system.   
Moreover, top BJP leader's have continuously attacked science and made unscientific statements in public trying to undermine rationality and scientific thinking.

> The BJP-led central governmenthas aggressively pursued the policies of commercialisation, centralisation and communalisation of education. It is accelerating the neo-liberal educational policies of the previous UPA government, aimed at deregulating the education sector and increasing the avenues of profit maximisation for the private capital. However, at the same time it is destroying the federal character of Indian education and is attempting to control the entire sector from the Centre, as part of the designs to push the Hindutva agenda. This is reflected in appointing RSS personnel in key administrative bodies, rewriting of history, abrupt and irrational changes in syllabi, propagation of pseudoscience, so on and so forth. The brunt of these attacks is falling upon the students from the socio-economically exploited and oppressed section.

&#x200B;

Yesterday my gf and her bff were smoking in Chembur area at their usual place. They noticed a stalker and they ignored. As they're very much adjusted to being visually stalked. Gf had some doubts and stood up to get a clear view and saw the guy was masturbating, she started shivering and notified the bff. They immediately got up and left that closed down 'tapri' and took another path. The man got up, and was stalking them from afar and started following.

This is where they stopped a Uncle on bike and informed him about the incident. To their shock, the uncle scolded them why are they roaming here and asked them to buzz off from the area. The stalker was still following them, so my gf called a male friend, while other one called 103. The police asked their co-ordinates. The stalker was keeping a sharp eye on pedestrians, while they decided to lure him by settling down at one place. He again started masturbating, my gf was getting panicked by each moment, while her bff calmed her down. Finally they came, the big blue van full of constables. The man ran and to their surprise, he was a handicap, so they shouted that ""him him"" the police caught hold of him and beat him. At first my gf was even terrified to look at him until constables slapped the guy multiple times and he started apologizing for what he was doing. Here comes the imp part

They asked to file a complaint so he can be detained, but my petrified girl couldn't. They told to give him some beating and leave him off. The police insisted on complaint bt they were terrified as it was their first time in this situation. Police took names and numbers of victim as well as perpertrator and thrashed him good.

The male friend arrived and scolded them as they didn't lodge a complaint. He said ""today its you, tomorrow what if he tries this on a small girl?"" But I cant blame them, their were terrified as fuck, even while narrating this, my gf was tearing up and fumbling.

Guys, pls tell your female friends to pursue legal action against such pervs. This must not be his first time and definitely not the last. I'm waiting for her to normalize a bit then i'll have to make her understand the importance of pursuing the legal action against him.

I'm very sure her reasoning for not doing so would be something like ""what if later on he throws acid on me ? what if he does anything to me while I'm alone?""

I'll keep notified if something happens

TL;DR : stalker was masturbating while watching her, called police, but refused to lodge complaint

4881,"India need new cities.Mumbai, Chennai, Delhi and Kolkata are getting overpopulated. Infrastructure is horrible, and cities were never planned to be industrial. 

Ground Water of these cities is also getting depleted. We really need to make people go to different cities. 


I think we need to build new cities, built strictly for industries and finance. we need to build them near coast and supply water though desalination plants. 

Desalination plants need to be built anyway as water from Himalayan region is no longer enough. It would also break our dependence on Kashmir. Israel does it and so will we need to. 

These cities should be built around industries, give land to capitalists at low costs, don't tax them for some time. Through executive decisions have them be except from labour laws and never ending red tape. 

Instead of overland infrastructure, use marine merchant fleets. Plan the cities around factories and let the people flock to them. Give houses for cheap to workers. because cities would be empty, we will easily be able to house migrants from rural regions


We should also need to do this after we send a team of intellectuals to a word tour so they can see how biggest industrial regions of the world work. Namely Shinzen of China. 

We should copy Shinzen model as feankly it is great. 

What we should do I'm totality is give free reign to capitalists in given regions on coast, and let those regions develop. Build new infrastructure. Build high speed rail to connect these new cities. Start from scratch. 

This will relive pressure on old cities, and bring capital to the country. As well as expertise. We were pretty fucking stupid to text to jump directly to service. We should have went to manufacturing. 

Once these cities are highly developed, the people will send money to inner regions and this way rest of the country will be uplifted as well. 

I think we should give special exemptions as passing reforms is really fucking hard. But asking Bengal to allow centre to let capitalists in these special industrial and financial zones free reign will be easy. Most of the country will be unaffected from negative consequences. 

We won't have to pass new laws. We will have to pass one law that gives executive power to bypass red tape, land acquisition and labour laws if both centre and state agree. 

States would agree as all coat is covered by centre and most benefit goes to the state.

Surprise : Nothing happen yet !

&#x200B;

I'm still fighting the case, date after date, months after month. This time i don't even know the next hearing date. Turn out that court's staff has taken money from the opposition lawyer and told us to come on 15th January while fixing the actual next date on 25th January on system (which is Saturday and court will be closed)

When we went to the court we had a big fight with staff about this but they said we can't do anything about it was clerical error.

We know they have taken money because they have good relationship with that lawyer. They talk on phone with each other in front of us and many such incidents. They don't even try to hide it.

Their lawyer is not coming since 3 hearing to submit his reply. Judge has ordered a final warning in last hearing to him to submit it in next date but now even we don't know the next date.

In my first post i was depressed this time i'm so numb that i don't even feel anything.

But he is one of those so-called educated folks because he did B.Tech from some random university in India. Now, he is a business analyst in world's top international organization. Yesterday, I had a phone conversation with him about the situation in India regarding CAA and NCR.

After a few minutes, the guy said, ""But they asked for it."". I asked, ""Who?"".

""The Muslims. Who else?"", he retorted. ""How?"", I asked.

""They are the terrorists, smugglers, antisocials, drug peddlers"", he replied.

All I could say was, ""Shame on you, Ryan. Shame on you. You are a minority and you are calling an entire minority community terrible people? You do not deserve to be called an Indian. Your best friend in the office is a Muslim from Lucknow and you say that Muslims are all terrible people?""

I doubt if he understood what I said to him. Some people are just bloody dumb and uneducated no matter which community they belong to and which university they went to. BJP banks on such imbeciles to rule India.",1579524585.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,184,198

5038,"Threats of violence will not stop me from stating my opinion on matters related to my country. The CAA must be protested against no matter what the government says. It's all an eyewash. Given the manner in which they have brought about the removal of Article 370, this should be obious.On the fine morning of 16th January I received threats from another redditor, who I will not name.

Based on what he said, he was not an Indian but most likely a Person of Indian Origin, possibly an immigrant, and in his own words, he ""work[s] a high powered job in [X]"", with dual citizenship of countries X and Y.

He thinks people my and college-student aged are stupid people, even though he's also under 30 (and barely older than I am).

There was an exchange of words, and to the best of my knowledge, I did not hurl expletives at him, although I obviously was a little snarky. I mean, he was calling me a ""stupid child"", that he'd ""slap [me] across the face and [I'd] walk straight"" and that he'd ""love to visit India and break some legs of protestors like [me]"". A really mature way of talking for someone who was trying to show off his qualifications.

Apparently by protesting the CAA, a ""dumb ass Indian faggot"" like me was preventing ""[his religiously affiliated brothers and sisters]... from gaining safety in India"". That he was ""glad"" that muslims were excluded, because they could go to Pakistan. Apparently he wasn't a proponent of the theory that most Indian Muslims rejected partition along religious lines and supported mutually inclusive Indian secularism.

Apparently, with my ""[low] IQ"", and quite obviously in deep contrast to his high IQ given his job, the CAA would survive as long as overseas Indians continue to support the CAA and NRC.

Why am I posting this now? Well, I have never faced actual threats of violence online before. I needed some time to process my thoughts. Thankfully it was only one person who felt the need to attack me directly. 

In hindsight, I do think that I should have engaged him in a better way than I did at the time. But he had closed off his mind anyway, and wouldn't let me say why was opposed to the CAA, because apparently in my answer, which to me is connected to the NRC, I was ""diverting"" from the issue at hand by going off on ""tangents"".

Apparently he perceived a ""superiority complex"" in my previous post, and felt the need to challenge it (with threats and abuse), when it is an indisputable fact that the most vocal ""unkill""-aged supporters of the CAA believe the vedas and the shastras (and a few other books) to be the last word on Indian values, in complete dissonance with the reality of India's religious pluralism, and that western culture is shit. I am very certain that many of you have interacted with exactly the kind of people I am talking about.

Well, Mr. ""High Powered Job Worker with Multiple Citizenships"", I hope that if I ever meet you in real life, you will have broadened your perspective by then, and moved on from breaking the legs of people who disagree with you. That, and opposition to a law does not mean supporting the strawman.

Just so that you can read it clearly, **I still oppose the CAA and your threats will do nothing to stop me.**

PS - One thing worries me though, is his accusation that the moderators of this sub delete any threads in support of the CAA. Now given that he had no posts in support of the CAA in his account, I don't actually believe him. I did find a lot of racism and feelings of racial insecurity/perceived discrimination complex though. However, I want to, in completely unequivocal terms, *encourage* the supporters of the CAA, for whatever reason, to make their voices heard.

If you don't hurl abuses and construct well-written arguments, I am sure you will be able to engage more constructively with those of us who oppose these measures.",1579455979.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,23,83

For one despite India’s corruption and poverty aren’t as dangerous as South America, Middle East or parts of Africa. Heck it may be safer for males than developed nations like America and Britain. (For Indian females it can be just as dangerous. Abuse of women is as high as the US)

Indian males are not as physically built nor armed as foreigners so they can’t inflict as much damage. For one we don’t see that many Indian street gangs, we know little about the organized crime. Often police may be working with goons but few people are targeted. People are rarely goons unless for religious or caste reasons much like the Middle East except we are not at war.

So how come foreign nations see us as lovely and safe? No foreigners would say this about America, Mexico or the Middle East.

(America is a developed nation but is considered a place with tough thugs because 1. Masses of criminals have weapons so homicides of gang members are high 2. Criminals are built and know how to box 3. Criminals are endorsed by music such as Hip-Hop etc.)",1579473602.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,6,0

5070,"Help me choose my stream for 11thHey Reddit,


Greetings! I  need to choose a stream for my 11th grade. I am mainly interested in medical and non medical sciences.


With non medical I can become a engineer whereas with medical I can become a doctor.
I am someone who's good at computers.


I can pursue computer engineering by taking non medical stream in my 11th grade. Taking this stream will make me a engineer in around 6 years (11th and 12th grade + 4 years of college) but I will have to move to another town for a job as there is no scope for an engineer in my hometown. I would have to leave my family  and I don't really do well with change. 


I love the respect a doctor gets but becoming a doctor requires many more years of study than non medical. I also like to do social service. Moreover with becoming a doctor I would not need to move. But becoming a doctor will take around 8-9 years(Very long period) and also this if I don't take a drop year to crack the post graduate exam. 
Sometimes I feel that becoming a doctor would be good but sometimes my opinion changes. I am fairly good at academics but I don't know which will be better for me.

 
I would be really thankful if anyone here would help me decide the right career for me as I have to submit stream application in a few days",1579455368.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,11

I'm going to India for a few weeks soon and I'm wondering if sunflower seeds are generally a common ingredient in indian food? I'm very allergic to it. 

I will obviously try to ask at every restaurant I eat at. Maybe some of you have a good phrase in hindi for what ""I'm allergic to sunflower seeds"" is called.

5168,"Does Flipkart oversell iPhone XS during the Republic Day Sale?For some reasons, I have always been Amazon-only guy. Never bought anything expensive from Flipkart. But iPhone XS at 50k seemed like a good deal and Amazon wasn't having those in stock.   
    
When the sale started for Plus users at 8:00PM, it went out of stock after a few minutes. I lost hope of grabbing the deal later at 12:00PM (since I wasn't a Plus user). But lucky enough, it showed in stock for a moment at 12:00AM and I made the purchase and paid. It went out of stock afterwards immediately (like 30 seconds later).   
   
Now, the packing and shipping dates are at least a week away. While this seems like perhaps due to their surge in sales, I'm not completely sure if they oversold the stock. A quick Google search reveals that Flipkart usually does this and then cancels the order and initiates the refund without even the consent of users.   
   
This sounds pretty terrible. I ordered few accessories to go with the iPhone XS for around 3k on Amazon. All these accessories are non-returnable (unless they are defective) and they would be delivered today. I'd be fucked if Flipkart decides to cancel my order.  
   
If Flipkart oversold and tries to refund the amount, what are my chances of getting a compensation from them, for the accessories I spent, legally?

This happened 3 days back when I had been at work. She has a spare key to my flat. We don't live together.

I was supposed to come back late but showed up at the usual time and I found her sleeping in my bed with her 'male friend' in the loo. I stayed calm and walked out when the guy came out and saw me glaring at her. I had a dozen missed calls from her when I came back to my flat the next day ( I spent the night sitting on a pavement bench not being able to bring myself to act or do anything about it)

The next morning(Saturday) , I got a call from her sister asking if we can talk. Her husband and she met up with me at mine and tried to convince me that it was a mistake and I should forgive her for the sake of our 'happiness'. I didn't talk to them at all,too shocked by all of it. They left eventually. Her parents and mine have yet to know about this.

The day to celebrate the enactment of the Indian Constitution, a document that has come under multi-pronged attacks from the BJP led Government and its Backers & Allies. This is the same document that makes India the world's largest democracy, a secular country with immense diversity of religions, languages & cultures. But with the looming threat of radicals, all off it is at stake unless we continue the series of protests that have been going on for the past 2 months. 

We should mark that day with co-ordinated nationwide rallies and marches to defend our Constitution & protest against the Government's anti-democratic activities. We should not let them use Republic Day to advance their own propaganda. We should maintain and campaign for it's TRUE purpose of celebrating the drafting and enactment of our Constitution. 

Organize rallies, gather in large numbers, organize public reading of the Preamble of the Constitution and show the strength of our unity. 

Use the hashtag #RepublicDayProtests to plan & publicize the same.

Firstly, lets be clear in contemporary Indian society the economy is totally bought and controlled by the 10 percent of the population with a handful of people influencing the most of it. A rapid growth without deliberate planning would disproportionately help the uber rich class than anyone else. 

Second, the way things are going, also seems to me that the current administration would just privatize everything which would make it look like the government made revenues but in a few years the public would feel the effects of all the lost revenues to privatization and monopolies.

Third, the ecological cost to such an unchecked growth tactic would be disastrous. As we are already seeing Adanis and other industrialists ripping out forests to build their factories or mines etc. The ecological cost is paid mostly by the poorest of the country.

All this to me raises the question, Is such a rapid growth even worth perusing? Let me know what everyone thinks.",1579440465.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,13,8

Please advise.My main usage is Virtualization host and media consumption online and offline. In 2-3 years I wish to get into penetration testing. So will need machine to support tools used for that as well.

For VM hosting, more ram and storage capacity is better. But my current laptop which has older i5 processor, I observe that  viewing media content online or even browsing heavy sites like reddit can be a heavy task for CPU. This makes me lean towards laptops with stronger CPU.

I woud prefer entire storage to be SSD as well. My current Asus laptop has become sluggish in less than 4 years. This makes me question usability of i5 processors as well. advancing  technology every year is another factor. 

I have budget between 60-75 thausand. Gaming isnt really a factor. I will have to buy additional Ram with the laptop. So, I am considering following 4 laptops. Please help me choosing the final 1:

5373,"The A,B,C on CAA & NRCIt’s outrageous that people can even support this open discrimination against Muslims.

Millions of people in India and around the world are not just protesting against the CAA and NRC but also against the failed BJP government. Is middle India only bothered about investing in Kashmir, building a Ram temple, and taking in Hindu refugees? None of these items put food on the table for normal people. These do nothing to secure a border to prevent people from crossing over, nor is there any policy of things that matter to all Indians, like increasing the availability of college education, healthcare, and building more infrastructure. These are common sense topics that are overridden by religious tension, which is played up by BJP as a distracting veil over all the issues.

Here’s the A,B,C on CAA and NRC -

A.	⁠ CAA/NRC doesn't mean anything for the non-Muslims in Pakistan who are being prosecuted today. It only applies to those who are already in India prior to 2014. 

B.	⁠⁠The protests are not against providing refuge to non-Hindus. They are against the implications of: ⁠
1.	⁠Only providing refuge to non-Muslims who are already in India prior to 2014. If the government really cared about religious persecution, they would've worded it accordingly instead of explicitly naming 6 religions except Muslims. ⁠
2.	⁠Coupling CAA with NRC and creating a loophole to provide everyone but Muslims refuge in the country. So many Muslims who were born and raised in India, but whose parents either came in illegally or whose parents don't have the necessary documentation from 40+ years ago, would be deemed illegal immigrants and kicked out or thrown into detention camps. 
3.	⁠⁠These protesters disagree with the draconian mistreatment of minorities in Islamic countries like Pakistan. And that's exactly why they don't want to see their India turn into something similar where Muslims are seen as villains simply because of their religion. 
4.	⁠Rampant corruption. A fucking sarkari babu holds power on making you an illegal. India is one of the most corrupt countries in the world and it’s giving power to these illiterate sarkari babus on who gets to be indian. This is the biggest joke. These idiots can’t even build a straight road without asking for kickbacks, and now you expect ordinary Indians to trust them. BJP has done jack shit to fix this deep rooted corruption.

C.       As an illustration of the evil link between NRC and CAA, if you are a bengali Muslim who ran away from East Pakistan during the 1971 war (wars cause refugees to run across borders because of rape and pillage and the other horrors of war) you will have descendants in India who have lived all their life here post 1971. Maybe there's documentation of this refugee status, but there probably isnt, but even if there is, you could have lost it in the floods (quite common in that part of the country). Your kid now can't prove citizenship by NRC standards even if they have tax receipts and have lived here all their life. You are now an illegal who can never apply for citizenship, you will be detained or deported. If you were a Hindu that did the same, you can now apply through the CAA. How is that okay?

D.      CAA and NRC makes it twice as hard for muslims to prove citizenship and apply for it. this is unfair in of itself! Why is it okay to say that we will make it much harder for you precisely because of your religion?

E.       Why aren't we letting in Sri Lankan Hindus: 

1. The selection of these countries in of itself stems from what seems to be a clear bias. Pretending as if only Islamic states are capable of persecution despite literally all evidence pointing otherwise (Myanmar and Sri Lanka have had long standing conflicts driven by state persecution, as examples), and that's why other communities from other countries aren't included. 

2.  Even if we bought for a second that it is about issues in these countries, there is widespread persecution against Muslims in these countries too, so why are we solving the issues selectively?

F.      Even if we take a strong stand against illegal immigration: hate to say this, but in this case why are the other illegal immigrants okay to naturalize? If this were your actual position, much as I disagree with it, the ideal way would be to draw up a quota and do it randomly rather than discriminate against one particular community.

G.       Where the hell are you going to house all these illegal immigrants, that have now been suddenly naturalized with the snap of a finger?What jobs are they gonna get, what education are they going to receive? Assam is in arms and protesting the destruction of their culture with the huge influx of bangla Hindus. But the government doesn’t give a fuck and actually is breaking multiple constitutional laws impacting Assam specifically on the protections they receive.

H.      NRC treats 'non Indian' Christians, Sikhs, Hindus, differently to non Indian muslims and that's not fine. Unless you mean to say that even if you are a non Indian hindu you are truly Indian, whereas if you're a non Indian Muslim then you arent Indian because of partition. Partition shouldn't be a reason to avoid help suffering people, plus the people living now had no say or control over the partition anyway.

I.     It seeks to legally establish Muslims as second-class citizens of India by providing preferential treatment to other groups. This violates the Constitution’s Article 14, the fundamental right to equality to all persons.

My cousin who's from even smaller town came here to buy medicines for my crippled grandmother since he couldn't find them there.

At about 9 pm bunch of cops surrounded him in front of the medical store, asked his name and he told them. He's a Muslim. They said that he's a Mohemmedan and the arrested him.

They tried to make him give false statements that he'd eloped with a Hindu girl and they'd free him and that the girl would be in favor of him. Good thing the watchman had warned him not to do so. They didn't let him call anyone until today afternoon, where my parents handled the rest and took hours to free him where they tried convincing even my parents that he'd tried to flee away with a hindu girl.

He's free now but he's in a great deal of shock, looks like he's traumatized. Can't blame him anyone would be he's such a straightforward innocent dude, recently completely his B.Sc and his his girlfriend is in shock as well.

A majority of people in the common society do not understand them as they are busy with our own lives.  we see many trans people have done commendable job for the society even though they still face discrimination.  They can contribute to the society better than men & women  if we treat them fairly.  Most of us are not socially knowledgeable. We don't try to know them. Because, we are selfish. Many people misguide about transgenders. We talk about ""Equality.""  But, We do'not embrace this culture. Some people give rude comments on transgenders. First of all, We should understand that who made them beg on the road & why we do not give them a job.  Let me give an example: if we are ill-treated or discriminated on anything that we need, to survive on this planet. will we keep quiet?  Don't we  argue with those who discriminated against.. or eccelate to the higher authority? The very next day, It will hit the headline. Treating a  person fairly should sprout from home irrespective of  gender Identity.  We people are ignorant about ""Equal Treatment."" We talk about it for a certain favor. But, We are not in favor of Justice, Equality for all living people on this beautiful planet.  if we were in favour of Equality, Transgenders would not be on the road begging for their livelihood. We do not try to dive into ''Truth."" We are taught to discriminate and how to evade from such situation since childhood. A chapter on Discrimination begins from Home. We, people, hate ""Feminity.""  and uphold the ''Masculinity.""  The one thing we should keep in mind that It is a transgender person who upholds the Feminity and live that way.  She never gives it up  in spite of discrimination. We should learn to love one another as human being ( A soul). Soul is like a driver Our body is like a vehicle. if Driver is corrupt in mind, he can't drive properly. there could be a collision. Likewise, if Your soul is corrupt, You can't lead a happy & peaceful life. There could be a collision with the another body which is in the same state of mind. 

As we all know, There are people who are corrupt in mind in every society.  Let's not judge book by its cover.  Spead the seed of Love & Compassion on the earth so that we can reap the good fruit out of it.

So, Let's respect everyone as human being but not based on one's gender Identity.",1579449415.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,0,6

5464,"Is Amazon's investment in India really that bad?I was going through several posts on this subreddit, and many people have expressed their disapproval of Amazon coming and investing $1 Billion USD in the Small and Medium Businesses by digitizing them and allowing them to sell stuff on their [platform](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/sme-sector/where-is-amazon-india-investing-its-1-billion-gopal-pillai-has-some-details/articleshow/73351076.cms).  

The main arguments seemed to be centred around two points - the money is ultimately going to drain from India to USA and China (a lot of sellers and manufacturers are Chinese), and that being a giant Amazon will kill all competition and monopolize the market.

Now, of course, Amazon is not doing a favour on India by investing in SMBs, but I feel that there is a big silver lining in this entire thing. SMBs with an offline storefront face the problems of inventory and warehouse management, but perhaps most importantly that of limited market reach. You can only reach so many customers if you own a small handicraft store or a handmade porcelain utensil store in a small street in Lucknow. Amazon gives such manufacturers a potential exposure to the entire country, maybe even to the entire world, and at the same time reducing the costs of offline retail management and middlemen expenses. That sounds like a pretty solid deal, doesn't it? With Amazon coming in, the quality of the product being manufactured will become the single most important criteria, giving desi manufacturers an edge in their competition with their Chinese counterparts. 

Moreover, building the entire system required to connect these SMBs to Amazon's marketplace will employ thousands of coders and Business Developers, so it's a win for them too.

The profit may very well drain outside of our borders to US, but the way I see it, the retail market in India needs the kind of revolution that has happened elsewhere in the west. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jul/28/amazon-small-business-benefits) talks about how most of the small retail shops (shoes, clothes, groceries) that used to line the avenues of New York have slowly disappeared since the rise of Amazon, Walmart, Target etc, and yet they seem to be doing pretty well behind the curtains as sellers on these websites. If anything, saving up on the rents of their shops has made their wallets happy. I don't really care if the profit ultimately goes to the richest man in the world or to some rich bloke in Bandra or Lutyens street. It's the profit generated by these SMBs and the money earned by all the blue-collar and white-collar employees that really counts.

After considering the helpful advice from you guys, I'm thinking of making the [following change to my route](https://imgur.com/a/bg3OS5j) (I'm skipping places in the following text to make it readable. Here's the [FULL ROUTE and places](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1VM3WsFAQAjup0y_tPwUJDESTGzftCDX_&usp=sharing)):

###[Old Route:](https://imgur.com/a/bg3OS5j)
Kolkata > Varanasi > Delhi > Shimla, Manali, Spiti Valley > Amristar > Delhi > Leh > Delhi > Rajasthan > Goa > Hampi > Hyderabad > Kerala

###[New Route:](https://imgur.com/a/bg3OS5j)
Kolkata > Varanasi > Delhi > Rajasthan > Gujarat > Goa > Kerala > Hampi > Hyderabad > Amristar > Shimla, Manali, Spiti Valley > Delhi > Leh > Delhi

###Analysis

I know Route 1 makes a lot of sense in terms of distance. However, I hope Route 2 makes sense in terms of weather. Following are the key takeaways from your advice that made me consider a route change:

* Rajasthan is hot as hell in April. It's significantly bearable in Mid March.
* Kerala is hot and humid in April end. It could be better at the end of March/ Start of April.
* Leh is fully frozen in early March. Could be better to visit in April end. Either way, the road would be closed. I might have to take flight to and back from Delhi
* Roads between Manali, Dharamshala, Spiti...etc might open in April end.
* Cant do the old route in reverse since I don't want to miss the Holi festival in Mathura.

###Problems in New Route:

* I'm taking a 1 day 15 h train from Hyderabad to Amristar. This is fine by me because I'm hoping to book a sleeper / 3AC and sleep/enjoy-scenes all the way there, saving on accommodation.

At night time around 2 am, series of sms came and around 37k of money got deducted from her three bank accounts.  She didnt have UPI linked to her YES bank account, that also they linked and deducted money from that.

From the first mistake, it can be realized that scamsters are using google ads for using their contact numbers to be shown as customer numbers for legit business like bluedart, fedex , swiggy etc.

Second mistake : I am not sure why they asked her to forward the weird alphanumeric sms to some number.  As per my understanding you need physical sim card present in your phone for UPI app to detect and register your number with your bank account, might be they are using this sms to clone your SIM number some how.  I didnt understand the usage of forwarding the sms to a number.

Third mistake :  This was a rookie mistake to give your UPI id and might be also along with it UPI PIN to strangers

So guys please beware of this scam , when you search on google about contacts numbers for some business , please make sure don't click on the ads shown by Google.  As you have got the contact number from Google you think the person on the other side of the phone is genuine which makes things easier for scamster.",1579366406.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,28,108

At work I’ve been at a junior level position for the last two years, however, just last week I was given my own project to handle and now I’m experiencing extreme anxiety. My boss said I have to become more responsible and take my own decisions here on, but I have a feeling that I’m not capable of the responsibility with how I’m struggling with my mental health at the moment, I’m able to perform tasks decently if I’m working under a senior but handling my own project I’m not quite sure. 

Should I talk to my boss about my depression and anxiety and how it’s affecting my work?

I need suggestions on whether I should talk to my boss about it or not. 

And if I should, how must I convey it?

I keep saying to myself that i shouldn't be taking it personally. But there isn't any feedback that encourages, boosts my morale. These rejections subconsciously erode my self esteem.

My friends tell me they suspect deficiencies in me repel women. I see people around me enjoying romantic relationships. And I'd be lying if I said it didn't hurt me. I feel a void. Of course the other person isn't going to complete me. But I haven't ever experienced the thrill, joy of requited love.

Just last evening it was communicated to me by the girl I liked that she didn't see me as anything more than a friend. I gracefully accepted it and withdrew myself from her life. That's because those emotions are still raw, unprocessed. And today I see her on a date with a person from our social circle. That visceral feeling of being inadequate, not enough is debilitating.

I'm told to work on myself. But sometimes it's just difficult to disregard these primal emotions. I'm feeling low. Would really appreciate a pep talk.",1579362008.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,12,19

5613,"An abstract pattern that I see whenever BJP, CONG, and a 3rd party face-off in a TV debateI was watching a campus face-off a debate that was held very recently by India today. there were 3 spokespersons from cong, bjp and aap. the students were allowed to ask questions and voice their opinions.

here are a few things you can infer from these debates. the bjp tries its best to whitewash any allegations put against it, blames it to an external source and basically howls a cry wherein it takes you to this fantasy side of its party that is working day and night to solve the problems (how when where nobody knows) and then gives glad tidings for the near future for something triumphant to happen. we've all fallen for this trap. you may appreciate the level of confidence, but in the end, nothing is delivered.

the congress, on the other hand, is just out there seeking attention. nothing much of a track record to boast over in the past few years. they have a reverbing sense of an approach to voice the victim's opinion and base some kind of legitimacy out of it

also, both these parties desecrate over each others weaknesses.

now the AAP spokesperson, and this clearly reflects in the comment section below, is very sensible. raises definitive questions. is more academically inclined..has a sense of civility and decency while answering and raising an opposing view and so on.

5741,"Tripura just got 40,000 more refugees.VERY SERIOUS DISCUSSION ON HYPOCRISY AND ILL-TREATMENT.


What's up with Tripura hosting every burden on Earth? Those Bangladeshis illegals are yet to be filtered out and now the govt has decided to give rehabilitation to Bru refugees that came to Tripura from Mizoram (displaced!). 

I don't know what's the main problem with having more 30-40k people in their own 80% forested state (in Mizoram). Why so selfish and conceited when India literally feeds their economy with a pacifier? The conditions are not as dire like in Tripura and Assam and moreover they're not even immigrants! The next time I hear them cry about racism and ill-treatment from the rest of India I'll cry tears of joy. 

And for Tripura, those who dissent are deemed to be Anti-India or Xenophobic. I ask them, why don't first check the ground reality of what's happening there? Check the population density for instance? Why Assam and Tripura?  And even after hosting a myriad of problems, it's the two who get all the flak while the other states lives in Utopia and act myopic. 

The govt is so scared to touch Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram that even the Chakmas were straightway sent to Arunachal Pradesh. I can't assert enough on how distasteful this is. I'm becoming less sane as I'm writing this. 

The indigenous people of Tripura have already showed strong resentment, yet the government can't seem to fathom it or search for alternatives. I won't even be surprised now if a mass scale genocide unfolds, it's what the government is looking for (since they're not even remotely trying to placate). They're trying to push it under the label of 'terrorism' so they can happily subdue and exterminate it. :)

 I hope those other 3 states enjoying ILP face the same fate someday. Eagerly waiting for it. Then they'll know about their hypocrisy. 
Tripura's CM (An Illegal) agreed on helping Bru people so that they, in return, help them in resisting the indigenous people of Tripura and for votes.

Let's brainstorm on the solution

I can only think of two possible solutions:

&#x200B;

1. Limit government officials carrying cash per day to 2000, unless they can show legitimate proof, ACB can raid them and seize all unaccounted cash.
2. Nobody may pass above act, what we can do is take snapshot of all 500/-, 1000/- 2000/- notes while going out of home and if forced to bribe for no benefit, post snapshot of those notes and officer's name and location",1579343075.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,15,18

Convincing someone whi raised you, who taught you everything you know and believe. Arguing with them that you believe in something different and society needs to change is hard.

Specially the 2-3 tier non-metro cities. 
How can one fight against the people in position of power who are hell bent on being against Intercaste marriages.

5746,"Can we have limited children policy combined with income tax?Suppose every couple is restricted to have a certain number of children based on the income tax they pay. By default every couple can have one child but couples who pay higher income-tax can have more children according to the tax paid by them in past years. 

So if you have paid 1 LPA for last 3 years as income-tax you can have 2 children, if you have paid 3 LPA you can have 3 children and so on. 

This will have mang positive effects on society: 

1. Properly of rich people will be divided into their multiple children, so inheritance wealth will be low for rich people whereas middle class and lower class families will not see division of properties. This will get rid of income inequality. 

2. Poor family can focus their resources on their single child. So children of poor people will have better upbringing.

5756,"Work culture varies drastically across geographies. I'd like an Indian perspective on different work cultures existing in different parts of the world.Hi. 
So, I know as a matter of fact, Indian work culture is quite toxic. Professionals don't have a balanced lifestyle and invest in other facets of like fitness, leisure and recreation. Professionals are overburdened and emphasis is placed on doing several half baked tasks over a perfectly executed one. 

In contrast, the work culture in Sri Lanka, is one that of complacency and lethargy. The island nation surely does love their afternoon siestas, their laid back attitude and ""it doesn't bother me "" attitude. 

Even in the service sector, mostly tourism, the consumer ends up being a price taker as opposed to a price maker. 

Another example would be that of Australia, the workforce in this nation strives to deliver quality results as opposed to the number of results/ projects delivered. The working hours are numbered and people aren't willing to sacrifice their weekends for double or triple their daily wages. 

Their life outside  work is equally important as life inside work. They're not willing to compromise their lifestyle. The boss employee hierarchy is not of a rigid hierarchy characterised by ego but is fluid , grounded and open to learning from eachother. 

So, I'm curious , what are your anecdotes on different existing work cultures on different parts of the world ? Brownie points if you know of non customary countries like Morocco, Colombia, Senegal etc.",1579319370.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,10,58

5778,"#Sleepintern by Wakefit. Possible data mining scam?I presume most of us have heard about the Bengaluru startup that is paying 1 lakh rupees to interns who can sleep for 9 hours a day for three months and contribute to a sleep study or something.

I applied myself, but when I went to their website lately, it says they received 1.65 lakh applications from more than 250 cities in the first round. Now having worked in data management myself, I'm sure it's extremely unlikely that one person or a team sat and read through so much of data, let alone shortlist people. So I'm sure they shortlisted everyone from the first round into the second round, which is a video resume.

Now it gets even more crazier - even if only 10% of the people from the first round uploaded their videos, that's more than 16K videos to review and shortlist for the final personal interview! Looks like a complete scam to me! Am I missing something??

I'm even more inclined to be suspicious because I've experienced their customer service and even been in their office for a mattress purchase. I can bet you every penny I got that they do not have bandwidth to conduct such a huge exercise. Now, they could have outsourced it to a third party, but that's an expensive affair and I somehow doubt it.

5809,"Education System India {15 YEAR OLD BOY} #THOUGHTSSo my last post was regarding rape in India.If you nothing about my country let me give you an idea about my country.India is 7th largest country in the world.We have a very large population approximately 133.92 crores (2017).We have more a cultural diversity of 3000 and more.So now lets move ahead on to title.
Well education on India really sucks 
I mean it really sucks.


In our country our intelligence are not tested but our memory is tested.
India is not producing students,engineer,doctor they are producing robots who just have knowledge but dont know how and where to apply.

Whats the point of having so much knowledge if you dont know how to use it.I mean its like having a library with thousands of books but no reader,i mean whats the freakin point??


So basically what i want to tell you guys is that quality of education in India is very poor.See is am in 10th grade so i know about our education System.I will not impose my thoughts on you guys but let you decide how our education system is.So lets take some questions which will help you decide.
.
.
.
.
.
.
Q1 Do everyone get chance to study ?

Ans1 No,not everyone gets chance to study.In India government has made government schools which is free for everyone but quality of education is really poor and very less children take admission in school.Poor people who are not educated do not send their children to school because they do not know about importance of education.Further it ties people in a vicious cycle where their next generation are not sent to school and they remain poor and uneducated.
.
.
.
.
Q2 Is there any gender discrimination in the field of education?

Ans2  There is alot of gender discrimination in India.India is a patriarchal society where men are considered more superior to women which lead to discrimination in many fields like job, education,public places,relegious places etc.
In India parents having conservative mindeset do not spend equal resources on their son and daughter.They tend to spend resources on their son education.Girls perform as good as boys in school and sometimes better but only few girls are sent for higher education.
.
.
.
.
Q3 What about pressure on students in India?

Ans3  Indian students have to go through alot of pressure.Some pressure from parents,some pressure from teachers,peer pressure and specially society pressure.See not every student is good in Handling pressure.In India pressure is so much that thousands of student commit suicide.Nearly 8 lakh student commit suicide in India.




I dont know when will this stop but we really need a change .We have to do something.Type of education we are getting in schools and colleges are finishing creativity.

The rituals that have been fed to them while growing up are accepted or followed not coz they voluntarily beleive in them or do they conform with the spiritual vibe, rather it's just a practice passed on from generation to generation and they tend to follow that social command. 

Theres an element of dogmatism in all religions. The rational individual draws a line between the spiritual and dogmatic element. The more you tighten your identity it's prone to come out as intolerant. That is something we must refrain from. But for the BJP this has been it's ultimate measure to win votes and assert dominance.

So I have an NRI account with SBI for which I haven't updated the KYC (Know your customer) in a long time. I wasn't even aware I had to do that, as it's not very common here in the US. When I called SBI in India they told me that I will have to provide several documents including a tax indentification number (social security number) and other things. They also told me that I can email all the documents to them at their office email address if that is convenient for me (which it is, as I am not in India).

So, my question is, how safe is it to have my SSN sent for this purpose. The SSN as most of you know is very important here in the US and can be used for identity theft if it falls in the wrong hands. Does anyone have any experience with this?

5898,"Opinion of CAA from someone who avoids politicsThe decision of the government to allow non-muslim foreign immigrants from neighbouring countries is the most important decision of the year after modi again rose to power in may 2019. There has been a lot of mystery surrounding the act and what its consequences and the worry for the muslim community further increases by the decision to maintain a national registry for which it seems necessary to prove your origin through documents which can be difficult for a lot of people.

A question arises that why the government felt it was necessary to implement such a clearly controversial decision. There was never a need for such a bill that invites immigrants from other countries and the modi government has previously never shown any interest in the hindus in the neighboring countries. So is the decision just a move towards making india a place reserved for just hindus by discriminating against the muslim community. As they couldn’t directly discriminate against the muslims on the basis of just religion as we claim to be a secular country and that would have been a direct war against the constitution so they decided to remove muslims exclusively from an important decision of the government which does not directly affect the common person of the country. So is this decision the first part of the plan of the modi government to radicalize the people to turn against the people of our own country just because they don’t follow the same religion as us. Is modi really such a petty thinker that he would waste the energy and resources of our nation to just push his Hindutva agenda instead of focusing on more important world issues at hand.

After the bill was silently introduced and quickly passed the government has been sitting in the back seat and are letting the events pan out as they can. The top level is not answering any questions and neither are raising new ones by acting as the decision is a good and fair and are letting the people of the country go up against one another. There has been a huge opposition to the act as any thinking person wouldn’t go up against the rights of other people just on small difference but the government has a lot of loyal followers who wouldn’t even dare to criticize the governments decision and the government expends a lot of energy to keep them on their side by circulating propaganda and diverting the issues so they are always in the good light.

But this just feels like the modi government is trying to rise in power and gain more control over the country and we can just wait for his next move and judge the true intention of the government whether it is power or just a more hindu state. So the next four years will be a fight between the common man vs the government and we can just hope that we have the will power to fight it to the end and have the sense to understand the plight that can fall on our fellow men if we fail to do so.",1579268854.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,10,20

I am an Indo-Fijian born and raised in NZ. After many years I have finally been able to trace the village where my great grandparents came from in the year 1910, from the Basti district. Me and my family, some 4-6 people plan to travel there to see the place where our ancestors came from and find hopefully make contact with and meet any remaining relatives we may have there. 

Although our elders only said good things about their ‘muluk’, the historical records and articles we have about their background and the history of Indian immigration and indenture in Fiji generally do not say many positive things about the region. As I understand life was always hard over there and for many it still is. Some of the Indians from India that I have met did not really have positive perceptions of the state either, they were saying that UP is dangerous and not to go but I cannot accept that

Is anybody from there or has been there? Obviously I’m aware that a lot has changed since the 1900s to the modern day

I was then introduced to some sites that advocate men's rights and advise youngsters on sexual strategy. It's centred around Western countries but they claim it works everywhere. I quite liked a lot of their advice and some of their theories seemed misogynistic but i looked around and they seemed factual.

I'm now disconsolate. I've lost hope at finding love. Not only am i not attractive but also not the masculine guy women desire. They tell me that women would tolerate me only for my resources and not for who i am. This leaves me despondent and resentful. These hypotheses have left me malcontented.

A lot of them said that unless I'm an 'Alpha' I'd be mistreated and be dispensable. This causes dissimulation and i constantly have to have a facade of being an 'Alpha'. I'm not that. And these aggravates my suffering.

I'm short and meek. It has also made me sceptical of marriage. Terrifies me the prospect of a woman staying with me just for my resources and cheating on me for bodily pleasures.

5988,"Trans Beggars being a fucking nuisanceI am sure most of you have experienced, in the park, or near a signal transgender men approaching you in an erotic manner to beg. these people are very different from what you and I conventionally see on the roads or elsewhere. Normal beggars come to your window or in person, they ask for money, some of them show their injuries, medical bills, etc. these people typically keep their distance and depend on your moral or ethical proclivity to donate. that's fine.

on the other hand, you have the transgender beggars, who are typically in groups, approach you in an erotic manner, beg in a relatively seductive tone, FONDLE, try to rub against you, etc. when you deny, they don't keep their limits, they mock, abuse, irritate and very hesitantly walk away.

Now, this isn't something new or a thing I am making up coz I am a transphobic piece of shit and a rightist propagandist trying to flare up my incompassionate flock to transgress and harm people blah blah blah...

NO, this is a serious cause of concern and most of you have also noticed or experienced it as I mentioned earlier. what do you think should be done? I am quite sure a lot of people who are trans, a few I personally respect like Cate Mcgregor would not condone these acts.

[Heard one of the cops sharing with me in confidence that there are strong rumours of Delhi elections getting postponed by a few months under the pretext of protests leading to law & order situation as BJPs own internal survey isn’t giving them more than 10seats?

I proceeded to the first floor and lo and behold, two congested lines. Everyone squeezing the shit out of each other. There are two counters and either of them are responsible for a specific task. The usual procedure for you is to take a form from these guys, fill that shit up and then come back to give it to them. 

I got fed up with the crowd. So i called the security and along with him requested everyone to maintain a line. Someone had to take the initiative. I stood behind everyone and let those who were abusing the order stand in my place. Altho we finally made the line, there were people who only wanted the form, and the form was also supposed to be handed by that guy who's already busy with a lot of stuff. I was like why can't yall have a different counter to collect the forms? You could hand a bundle to the security guard? Efficiency naam ki cheez nahi.

Some of them take the time to explain what exactly they want from me. If it's specifically about my alma mater or previous job(s), I do try and give a response.

No where on my profile have I mentioned that I'm open to giving advice of any sort, btw.

I'm somewhat in two minds over this. On the one hand, I don't want to respond because... well it takes time and I have a lot of things on my plate. This is particularly true for those who ask vague questions. 

On the other hand I do sympathise with such people because I could have also done with some advice when I was in their shoes.

However as I am aware the following animals were traditionally kept as pets:

Green Indian parrots (tota, popat, mithoo) of different species

Mynah (maina) birds of various subspecies 
Both of these were popular because they can ‘talk’

Local dog breeds which served various purposes 

Mongoose (neola, neur, beji) kept for pest control, mostly to protect from snakes. Many folk tales talk about their loyalty. One of my uncles used to have one

Civet cat  (kasturi billi or mushk billi, poonagu poonai) similar to above were kept by some communities. Sotimes these are exploited for their perfume. Some tribal people eat them.

Fishermen in some regions of Bengal used otters (luddar) for fishing

Indian squirrels are apparently friendly, easy to tame  and were kept by some people

Unfortunately some other animals such as monkeys and bears were exploited for entertainment and trained using cruel methods 
 

In modern era  various imported breeds of parrots such as budgerigars are very common, rabbits, things like that. Of course dogs are most popular but Cats don’t seem to be that popular though",1579236901.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,40,33

One doctor thinks it's the protestors that are beating up police.

&#x200B;

One architect claims ""The crackdown on anti-CAA and NRC protests is necessary to weed out  illegal immigrants who entered the country and **are the cause of rise in  inflation, economic slowdown and rising crime rates in the country. They  have stalled our progress.** The question of personal freedom does not arise if one understands the government’s policy for passing such bills.""

&#x200B;

One aunty says whatever is good for nation is welcome. Presumably, the underlying assumption is that *everything* government does is ""good for nation"".

Amazon, alongwith the other tech giants Google, Facebook, Microsoft have mastered the art of Tax Avoidance and shifting profits offshore.

Amazon itself has destroyed Book stores, mom & pop stores and other small businesses in the US. Only mega corporations like Walmart, Target etc can compete with them in the offline sphere.

They have a history of shitty labor practices. Employees being forced to pee in bottles in order to meet quotas, delivery drivers being overworked to death.

And on top of that, Amazon looks for special privileges and Tax Incentives when deciding for new Headquarters, Offices & fulfillment centers. They know they have a monopoly in the online marketplace and abuse that fact to strong arm local goverments to give them special tax incentives, resulting in loss of state & federal taxes.

I'm sure there are other factors too (plastic waste, shady sellers and fake products etc) which someone more knowledgeable than me can hopefully explain better

I know this government has done a lot of shitty things during the past 5+ years, but calling out Bezos is not one of them. I'm glad that our ministers are not sucking up to him and having his already massive ego stroked even more",1579237352.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,25,45

6252,"Emerging trend of Crowdfunding for causes as opposed to conventional NGO system 

There has been a trend that has been occuring in recent times in India as well as across the world . That is crowdfunding or fundraising for a specific cause or issue. This is being conducted by Indians from various backgrounds who are very passionate about a certain cause or issue and try to actively advocate for and appeal for funds in order to achieve their goal. 

The most recent example of this is by Cecille Rodrigues, a professional musician from Goa who has become a social activist and was a candidate for Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the 2017 Assembly elections. She developed and released a song on the pathetic and pitiful state of the roads across the state of Goa last September which became popular across Goa and was trending across social media. She began a campaign called #rosto meaning roads where she has been travelling across the state writing on areas where there should be speed breakers, also highlighting where there are potholes and poor state of the roads and malfunctioning traffic lights. She has been doing daily posts across instagram, youtube and facebook. As a result of this Goans from the United Kingdom and locals in the various areas have donated money in order to build these speed breakers and fix the roads. 

Another example of this is by Sanjay Tiwari, who is a filmmaker, poet and social worker. He conducts an annual initiative where he donates and provides sweaters to homeless and needy people across New Delhi. This year he extended his initiative to other cities such as Indore Gwalior and so on. The people could donate their old sweaters as well.The first stage of this initiative was to collect funds which was done through promotion and appeal for funds over all the various social media platforms and youtube as well. After this was done then the orders for the sweaters were made and then transported and then distributed. There were also activities that were done by children in certains villages to appeal for funds.Each step of this entire process was shown with regular daily posts with the total amount collected and the exact amount being used to purchase the sweaters. 

It is my belief that this is the future of social and development work. The conventional NGO model and system is very laborious and any donation to them means it is going to the administrative expenses such as salary of the staff, their travel expenses and office expenses, hardly any of the money goes directly towards the program or projects being conducted. It is also very difficult to trace your donation. There is a huge staff  of field workers, accounts, supervisors, overall program managers and ultimately the organisational head, all of which need to be paid well. 

This is not the case with the crowdfunded causes and initiatives. They are mostly transparent and you can see the money going directly for the specific purpose. The people involved in these initiatives are usually very active on social media and give you an exact break up of what the money is needed for and once the money is raised what it will be spent on. They then usually show you the result of the money you have donated after the specific cause has been achieved. It is also mostly done by volunteers who do everything related to the initiative such as logistics and use their own money for any costs involved. It also helps to bring people together to work on the particular cause and to donate their time and money and give them a feeling of doing something good and ownership of their area. 

I support this crowdfunded model or cause based model of development which I believe will gather more steam as time goes on as people would like to see more active and transparent developmental activities and be able to part of it as well.",1579245405.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,1,19

**Tl;dr**  
We all know the basic problem in India. Quite often we make great laws, but their enforcement does not happen. The TRAI is \*finally\* trying to fix this on Net Neutrality. Despite having clear rules, we still do not have any enforcement mechanism. The first step in this is removing existing ambiguities, introducing a monitoring framework and then imposing penalties. The TRAI has taken a positive step towards fixing this by releasing a recent consultation paper. Read on for our summary and how you can participate!

&#x200B;

**Net Neutrality demands action**

Net neutrality has been a long enduring bond more than a million forged with the #SaveTheInternet.in campaign. Through it, they petitioned the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI), a regulatory body which was instrumental in making rules and recommendations to protect the open internet. Quite simply, it protected user choices and ensured people like you were not left left to the mercy of large telecom companies who are Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

The Net Neutrality rules today prevent ISPs from choosing to charge you additionally or slow down your access to your favourite websites because their owners do not pay such ISPs extra money. In short, this is a massive win for internet users and the open internet. This has been a long time coming and we have documented [**this history in a separate explainer.**](https://savetheinternet.in/blog/guess-whos-back-back-again-savetheinternet/)

However, despite clear rules that last came in September, 2018 to prohibit ISPs from both distorting traffic (slowing down your favourite online services) and in April, 2016 on pricing (charging you on the basis of websites you access), we still do not have any enforcement. This is why we had [**relaunched the SaveTheInternet.in in March, 2019**](https://savetheinternet.in/why-this-again/) and petitioned TRAI and the nodal central government ministry, the Department of Telecom to begin monitoring for violations, create an enforcement framework and also to take interim action against website blocking.

&#x200B;

**Let us help TRAI make a clear, citizen centric enforcement framework**

TRAI on Jan 2, 2020 released a [**consultation paper**](https://main.trai.gov.in/sites/default/files/CP_02012020_0.pdf) titled as the, “Traffic Management Practices (TMPs) and Multi-Stakeholder Body for Net Neutrality."" The comments on it are due by Jan 30, 2020 and there is a further counter-comment period  till Feb 13, 2020 (yes, just one day before Valentine’s day!). Comments should be sent to Sh. Asit Kadayan by email at advqos@trai.gov.in. So let us show our love for the internet by participating in this consultation. 

We are especially enthused by TRAI's clear statement which recognises the value of civil society and voices when it notes that, “*Civil society organizations may also be the part of MSB as they engage in advocating the public’s rights and wishes of the people, including but not limited to health, environment and economic rights. They fulfil the important duties of checks and balances in democracies, they are able to influence the government and hold it accountable.*”

&#x200B;

**How do you participate? And more!**

1. **Send in your comments:** Even though we do not have an online submission form this time, we have shrunk down this 34 page consultation paper to a 6 page capsule. While many of the issues are technical, effective and wide comments should definitely be made by you and we believe your voice should be heard. We encourage you to read the summary, share and adapt it in any way you may like!
2. **Help IFF take a position:** We have from the very beginning relied on the expertise of our leadership and staff that has been strengthened by public feedback and inputs. Here you can help IFF take a strong position on Net Neutrality. We are especially looking for technical experts, network engineers and academics to provide us considered thought to help further the cause of #SaveTheInternet. So shoot us an email at policy@internetfreedom.in
3. **Sign the, “Take Action” Petition:** While such enforcement frameworks are being devised and will take time, there exist clear breaches of net neutrality in the form of illegal website blocking by ISPs. This is the clearest form of existing violations of binding license regulations. Join more than 3000 people who have signed on and are asking for immediate action and remedy at [**SaveTheInternet.in**](https://internetfreedom.in/trai-consultation-on-net-neutrality/savetheinternet.in) in the meanwhile. You can support this campaign by signing on!

*Remember, the last date for sending in comments is Jan. 31, 2020 and counter comments is Feb. 1. The email for submission is* [*advqos@trai.gov.in*](mailto:advqos@trai.gov.in)*.*

1. People are protesting in Shaheen Bagh and not letting ambulances through - people are literally dying as a result ( I had no comment and I cannot ascertain the facts)

2. Freedom is not free. (Yes we have had to fight for it)

3. What's wrong in people queuing up for NRC? Do you want 50k outsiders in your home and creating chaos? ( I have a problem you telling me to line up to prove I am an Indian)

4. India should be a dictatorship for a period of 10 years to fix it. We need to have limits on kids etc etc ( Who decided who is right in that case?, What if the dictator says no kids, no cars, give up your land..)

5. Look at where China is.. they achieved independence after us. ( Why don't you go to China? Why are you in Canada or US? ) 

6. How can old people still be in colleges - example Kanhaiyya Kumar (He completed his PhD by 31, our PM did his non proven MA at 35)

7. Students should focus on studies not politics (Our supreme leader also focussed on Politics)

It was quite clear she buys pretty much all the crap that the Godi Media serves up. And also proves you may have fancy job and fancy education but no bloody common sense.

Right  now I'm thinking the best way to salvage my honor, whatever is left of  it, and career is to try for a domestic MBA, CAT, SNAP, XAT etc.

My main  question is how do I explain the massive gap in my resume, 3.5 - 4  years to college recruiters IIMs, FMS, IIFT, Symbiosis etc.

I  know I can say I prepared for UPSC but will that suffice? and how  can I get an edge over other people who are preparing for MBA right  after they graduate?Like learning a new language or a software like excel etc

6499,"Corruption in the Indian Medical Community - Yes, it existsThe recent report regarding corruption in the Medical field has seen growing outrage from all quarters. First, opposing corruption in medicine does not equate to supporting Modi. IMA has refused the allegations and is demanding proof. I went digging and this is what I found:

From [The BMJ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_BMJ)

>The corruption strangles everything, Sir. It’s like a cancer.” Accompanied by apologetic shrugs and half smiles, statements like this are commonly heard in India. I knew this was the case before I went to work as a volunteer physician in a small charitable hospital in the Himalayas, but what I didn’t realise was how far the corruption permeates the world of medicine and the corrosive effect it has on the doctor-patient relationship.

…

>I met a former pharmaceutical sales executive who left the industry, sickened by the corrupt practices he was supposed to employ. Working for one of the largest drug companies in the country, he was expected to bribe doctors with money and luxury goods. **The crunch came when a doctor demanded that the company fly him to Thailand for a holiday and then provide him with prostitutes at his home. When the company representative queried this, his manager told him to comply, and he felt he had no choice but to resign, protesting that he was “not a pimp.”**

[Corruption ruins the doctor-patient relationship in India](https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g3169)

What incentive does an Australian doctor have to spread fake information?

Also, this isn’t the first time the GoI and the Indian medical community has locked horns. 

>The problem of governance issues between the Government of India and MCI still exists. Although MCI is an autonomous regulatory body for medical education, it needs to have a cordial relationship with the Government. However, in absence of such a relation the erstwhile UPA Government of India drafted a new bill to replace MCI in the form of a National Commission for Human Resources on Health. The bill could not be passed due to rejection by the Parliamentary standing committee on health. Under the current circumstances, MCI reigns supreme and it all depends on the attitude of the office bearers to regulate medical education in India. The problem of bribery still remains open, though unreported officially.

>Another point that needs to be considered is the link between doctors and pharmaceutical companies. MCI has issued an order in this regard to stop doctors from getting gifts from pharmaceuticals. However, the practice of giving benefits in other forms such as sponsoring a trip for conferences, symposia with full payment of registration fees, travel, stay and lodging in star rated hotels still exists. This leads to the unfair practice of prescribing medicines of the brand they are tied up with the pharmaceutical company.

[Corruption: medicine’s dirty open secret](https://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g4184/rr/759384) 

>Two weeks after The BMJ published the articles the Hindi channel News Nation TV aired Operation Jonk.5A sting operation showed diagnostic centres offering kickbacks as high as 50% to doctors for referrals. Unnecessary treatment, expensive diagnostic tests, and insurance fraud are also common.The English language news channel NDTV is also campaigning against corruption. One programme showed drug companies offering doctors bribes—including cash, iPads, and expensive cameras—for prescribing branded drugs instead of the generics that the medical council mandates.

[India turns spotlight on kickbacks for referrals](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g5265) - sadly under a paywall.

> India is said to have one of the most corrupt medical systems in the world (1). The situation has become so bad that patients today approach the doctor with mixed feelings – of faith and fear, of hope and hostility. This leads to a distorted doctor-patient relationship, with high chances of exploitation both ways – doctors may fleece patients and, if some lacunae are exposed in treatment, patients or their relatives may blackmail doctors (2).

6548,"english app is easier to monetize in India because english speakers are generally better off ?I used to work for bytedance which owns tiktok, helo and vigo in India. 

At the beginning when helo APP was launched, the boss said the app would be operated only in local languages. So very little English content would be shown and all posts in English would be given very limited traffic. The UI wasn't even in English.

About two months later, content creators and some regional celebrities were needed in helo for content and marketing , so English content was added to meet their demands. 

 Soon, more and more creators and celebrities started posting in helo.  Most of their posts were in English though they were suggested to post in local languages. Traffic limitation for English content was gradually canceled.

Recently, i heared from a friend that though daily active users in helo are over 40 million, monetization remains a big headache. So the boss is changing strategy and will focus more on English content and English users-- a group which takes comparably less time to monetize more.

FYI, one of my friends is working on a Chinese app in bytedance. there are only 5 million daily active users in this app but it is earning big money.",1579189993.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,1,12

Couldn't help thinking that this is the way it should be, especially for the Sabarimala issue. I am in favour of women entering the temple, but not by way of  a court order or legislation.

The only information I could dig up was the comment by Union Minister G Kishan Reddy who said the exact data for determining the number of eligible refugees for citizenship under the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was yet to be prepared. CAA protestors and supporters seem to have very different numbers for this.  
2. Given that the cutoff date for CAA is 31.12.2014 - what kind of proof a persecuted person is expected to provide for proving his entry into India before said date? Also, what are provisions for refugees belonging to mentioned religions in CAA but entering India after the cut-off date?  
3. CAA is said to cover only persecution on basis of religion and not persecution on grounds of race, gender, membership of a political or social group, language, ethnicity, etc. But what is the yardstick for classifying or ascertaining this?  
4. NRIC and CAA are two sides of the same coin and as such cannot be viewed separately. Who is a 'doubtful citizen' under Sub-rule (4) of Rule 4 of the 2003 Rules, which says that ""during the verification process of the Population Register (or NPR), a step before the NRIC is prepared, an individual or a family would be marked as ""doubtful"" citizen or have ""doubtful citizenship"". It is neither defined in the 2003 Rules nor in the Citizenship Act of 1955. There is no clarity as to how local authorities will identify and decide on who is a doubtful citizen.  
5. Given that the NRC exclusion rate in Assam was approximately 6%, are we looking at exclusion of at least 7.86 crores of people? Will CAA act as a safety net for said people who belong to Hindu, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, Christian & Parsi communities?- a narrative that is being focussed by CAA protesters. What happens to people from communities (Muslims & others) who are excluded from NRIC and do not fall under CAA - Do they end up going before Foreigners Tribunals as in the case of NRC exclusion in Assam?  
6. What is the total number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants in Assam and what percentage of those will be eligible under CAA?

6853,"Why did the Congress refuse to give a separate status to Sikhs and Buddhists under Article 25(2)?Under Article 25(2) of the constitution of India, the Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains were considered a sect of Hinduism. In January 2014, Jainism was given the status of a separate religion, but they still fall under the Hindus laws of family, marriage and succession.

While some Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains wanted to be considered a part of Hinduism, many of them did not and those who wanted to be considered Hindu had the choice of adopting Hinduism. My question is in the Historical perspective as to why did the Congress not give the status of separate religions to Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists at the time of the formation of the constitution.

Was there purpose:

1. To give a special status to Hinduism, i.e. strength by numbers?
2. To prevent the fragmentation of India as they thought Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists would demand a separate state like Muslims did?
3. To maintain the caste system, as the lower castes would remain lower castes Hindus despite converting to any other religions among Sikhs, Jains and Buddhists?

What is the policy of Congress regarding the issue of separate religion status for Sikhs and Buddhists at the current time?

6854,"Thoughts about India after visiting Vietnam.I went to Vietnam on a holiday recently. We selected Vietnam because we were fascinated by its growth and also we were deeply saddened by the devastation that the Vietnam war have unleashed on the country. Vietnam remains the largest chemical weapons deployment site till date. US dropped more bombs in vietnam than it did in world war 2. Yet the country is booming. 

We were surprised to see cities with very good education decent health and lots of jobs for the population. An English-speaking tourist guide in Vietnam without a degreee earns more than 30,000 rupees a month. A decent restaurant meal costs less than 300 rupees with all sorts of seafood included. Even in the remotest villages we found good schools with playgrounds. Small factories producing handicraft, garments and small electronic devices are throughout the countryside. 

The most important feeling was that of Hope. Vietnamese people want progress and want to be leader in manufacturing and later innovation.  

My parents said that they were sad that India was a much better country during the time they grew up. There was hope and there was a feeling of pride in how we were using the little resources in the puursuit for our national development. Today the narrative in India is centered on religion caste and other useless nonsensical factors. How are you going to get jobs because there aren't many factories which are exporting goods to the developed countries. We import even edible oil and onions. 

I have a deep fear that India will not even manage to become like Vietnam in the next 50 years. In Vietnam there was a Subway being constructed. The entire area was covered to prevent dust from coming out and the roads were pretty decent. We traveled over 700 kilometers in the countryside and did not witness more than 3 to 4 kaccha houses. You may blame communism for destroying the world but it seems that some socialistic aspects are necessary to create a thriving economy, like education and and decent infrastructure. 

We spent less than 30,000 INR per person and got to experience luxury hotels, great sea food and amazing nature. We spent the same amount in Goa in 2013 and got to live in budget rooms, eat stale sea food and go on overhyped tours that were crowded and chaotic. 

My parents also agree that it doesn't make sense to Holiday in India anymore because you can get a better experience in countries like Malaysia Indonesia Vietnam or Thailand.


 If us common people are thinking like this imagine how investors are thinking. India is not an investment destination because we do not have the resources to create the infrastructure and culture of hospitality that other countries offer. Foreigners have to register at some police station or foreign office and pay double or triple the price for entering a tourist destination. 

Tourism is the second largest employer globally. This experience taught us that India gets less than 10 million tourists and Vietnam gets more than 15 million tourists for a reason. India is being disrespectful of what the world is really thinking about us.  We think we were great 5000 years ago so we are great today. That is false. India is going into a downward spiral of chaos.",1579148387.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,312,852

Why are you forcing children to send postcards to Modi? Why are you marketing 8866288662 as Sunny Leone's and Alia Bhatt's number? Why do you need the support of a man that admits to not having read the CAA?

2. To the man with a Chappan inch ki Chhati:

Where was that strength when goons attacked students while the police watched? Where was that strength when ""Goli Maaro Saalo Ko!"" was shouted? Where was that strength when CMs promised to snatch assets from protestors? 

3. To the man saying ""There will be no NRC""

Why does your Manifesto say otherwise? Why does you own Party president say otherwise.

4. To those saying ""Indians won't be affected by NRC""

Please explain what happened in Assam? Please explain why bother with Aadhar if it can't prove nationality? Please explain why my father's voter card comes in a different name every year!

5. To those thinking NRC is a walk in the park:

 Remember DeMo, it was stressful. That was money, this is your nationality. This is not a ""Let there be light"" situation, Money, Time and Effort. The babus you complain about will be busy, YOUR tax money will be used to test YOUR nationality.

Ortega rose up as a revolutionary but since then has seized power and installed his wife as the vice-president. The economic conditions are dire in their country.

6885,"My proposal to solve the issue of illegal immigrants while keeping humanity, justice and Assamese concerns in mind.I wanted to think about how to once and for all solve the root issue of which NRC is a symptom. I feel I have a humane and just solution to the core issue of illegal immigration problem that would satisfy both our brothers in Assam and rest of India protestors. I wanted to know what you guys think?

This is how I define the problem.

1) The problem is we have illegal immigration for over 40 years from Bangladesh. Anyone can go to Assam/Tripura and see for themselves. This was ignored and even encouraged by Left/TMC/Congress politicians to increase their Muslim vote bank. 

2) Trying to round up 3-4 millions of illegal immigrants carries an unacceptable risk of illegally rounding up poor and undocumented Indian citizens. 

3) Furthermore it's inhumane to round up the children and grandchildren of the illegal immigrants for the crimes of their ancestors and crimes of corrupt Indian politicians looking to appease their Muslim vote bank.

4) While deportation is effective for some illegal immigrants it won't solve the issue entirely because of the same reasons above. (Inhumane to be applied to children and grandchildren off illegals born here and can accidentally deport poor undocumented Indian citizens)

5) If you just leave all the illegals as is or give all of them citizenship then you fuck over the Assamese and other NE people and screw over all legal immigrants and refugees.

So what to do ? Here is my solution.

1) Classify everyone into citizens, undocumented, illegals, refugees.

2) If someone is confirmed/verified to have illegally immigrated THEMSELVES from a foreign country, then they are an illegal. However any children born and raised here will not be classified as illegal but rather undocumented.

3) Anyone who cannot be proven to have come here illegally themselves is classified as undocumented.

4) Any illegal or undocumented who can prove themselves to have fled persecution is a refugee

5) Any illegal is deported.

6) All undocumented & refugees are spread out all over India to reduce burden on any one area.

7) Any refugee gets asylum and a path to citizenship.

8) Any undocumented gets a visa and is put on a pathway to citizenship. This pathway for undocumented will have integration requirements. They must learn and adopt the local culture and language of the area they get put in. So for example, any undocumented who gets put in Assam needs to learn Assamese and assimilate to Assamese culture and way of life.

I think this solves the core issue of illegal immigrants while remaining humane and just and kind and considering the legitimate concerns of Assamese and other Indians who are against illegal immigrantion.

So what do you guys think ?",1579081023.0,,,dark,14,1

He might be a double agent who was working with one of the factions of a central  intelligence agency ( might be the doval group ).

When he was arrested at the check post , IG of Kashmir was also present .,now why such a high ranking officer was present ., Reports claimed that when davinder Singh boasted of his status and connection the said IG even slapped him.
The body language of the IG Vijay Kumar seems to be of a tough and honest cop.

That leads us that another faction within intelligence wanted to give a signal to the higher ups about their capability and hence they might have tipped the state police about the whereabouts of davinder Singh.

### Tl;dr

On Monday, we published inputs to the [**National Cyber Security Policy**](https://internetfreedom.in/a-cyber-secure-india-starts-with-securing-indians/) that focus on protections for security researchers. Today, we demonstrate how the absence of protection results in tangible damage. To do so, we have studied the case of Dissent Doe, a US based journalist who reports on data breaches. In August 2019, Dissent Doe had reported that counselling related data of 300,000 employees of 1to1Help’s corporate clients had been leaked due to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services bucket. Today, Dissent Doe is being sued by 1to1Help before the Bangalore City Civil Court. To usm this demonstrates a tangible need to not only change the National Cyber Security Policy but build legislative protections within the framework of the Personal Data Protection law. 

### Shooting the Messenger

As the community of cyber security professionals increases in India, there are often questions on what processes they should follow for vulnerability and data breach disclosures. Even when done in good faith, such persons tread a dangerous path and face risk of legal prosecution. Today, we illustrate a routine case which demonstrates how an absence of clear positive protections in the law prevent security researchers from doing their work to keep users of technology safe in India. 

We have taken the instance of [**Dissent Doe,**](https://twitter.com/PogoWasRight) who runs a journalistic and reporting portal at databreaches.net. On 1 August 2019, Dissent Doe had publicly disclosed that counselling related data of 300,000 employees of 1to1Help’s corporate clients had been leaked due to a misconfigured Amazon Web Services bucket. 1to1Help is an Indian company that provides counselling services to employees of prominent business corporations. As per Dissent Does's statement, the exposed data was over five years old and it is unclear why 1to1Help continued retaining such old sensitive personal data in an unencrypted and insecure form (read more [**here**](https://www.databreaches.net/a-misconfigured-aws-bucket-exposed-personal-and-counseling-logs-of-almost-300000-indian-employees/)). 

Further, as per Dissent Doe, prior to making this public disclosure, they had reached out to 1to1Help multiple times and provided them an opportunity to secure the data and notify individuals whose personal data was compromised. Since 1to1Help did not respond to Dissent Doe’s initial emails, they reached out to some of 1to1Help’s corporate clients and informed them about the data breach without disclosing any personally identifiable details of employees whose data was included in the misconfigured bucket. According to Dissent Doe, on 6 August 2019, the Bangalore City Civil Court granted an ex parte interim injunction in favour of 1to1Help (Read more [**here**](https://www.databreaches.net/1to1help-net-gets-injunction-against-databreaches-net-seeks-criminal-charges-against-blogger/)). 

Such litigation often emanates when security researchers, vulnerability testers and journalists make responsible disclosures. Today, there is a lack of proper legal protections, defined processes and a duty on entities that hold personal data to make pro-active disclosure. Citing concern, we are issuing a short statement and also calling for wider support through legal fixes which are urgently needed to safeguard the privacy and security of personal data of users and hold those who possess it accountable. 

### Bug Bounties, not Vexatious Lawsuits

We are concerned with legal action against security researchers and journalists who make responsible disclosures of data breaches. To us, such prosecutions, which include several public instances including that of Dissent Doe, undermine the security of Indian internet users. Security researchers and journalists who report data breaches perform a vital function by exposing vulnerabilities that need fixing. Good faith vulnerability research and disclosure is necessary to limit the damage caused by a data breach and take corrective steps. Therefore, leading technology companies around the world provide recognition and rewards to security researchers who report vulnerabilities through bug bounty programmes. 

Unfortunately, as [**this article**](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-50583733) notes, despite rapidly digitizing its infrastructure, India still has a long way to go in recognizing the value of good faith vulnerability disclosure. Despite being a sizeable number, Indian security researchers are wary of reporting vulnerabilities because they fear being sued. Instead, security researchers based abroad tend to break these stories because they are safely outside the jurisdiction of Indian courts. This excessive reliance on foreign security researchers who have little accountability before the domestic legal system can have national security implications, and it is in our own interest to cultivate an indigenous security research community. 

In India, security researchers are constantly at risk of legal action because Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 penalizes anyone who gains unauthorized access to a computer resource without permission of the owner, and it fails to draw a distinction between malicious hackers and ethical security researchers. Instances like Dissent Doe's exemplify the urgent need for law reform in India. To promote good faith vulnerability disclosure, the Parliament must not only amend the Information Technology Act, 2000 but also look towards making suitable policy and regulatory frameworks within the field of data protection. 

The present draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 falls short on this aspect because it only obligates data controllers to report data breaches to the Data Protection Authority and there is no requirement to notify the data subject whose personal data has been compromised. In contrast, the Personal Data and Information Privacy Code Bill, 2019 introduced by Dr. Ravi Kumar as a private member’s bill obligates the data controller to notify the data subject in addition to the relevant authorities. 

Till these legislative changes are made by the Parliament, we urge companies like 1to1Help to recognize the importance of vulnerability disclosure as a responsible business practice and work with security researchers instead of threatening them with legal action.

From Jadavpur University to JNU, from Bengal to Kerela, it is the left that is on the streets. Kerela, as you know, was the first state to refuse implementation of the bill. They are now also the first state to go to Supreme Court against any Central govt law, for the first time in history.

In Bengal too, the Left Front parties were the first who started to protest against CAA (started since October 2019 against NRC). They were the first to protest against NPR and threatened to destroy detention centres if they are built forcibly. The bourgeois media (imcliding the likes of NDTV) focuses on TMC whose leaders have no problem meeting with the PM and continue the work of NPR, despite protests. They refuse to create a national front against CAA.

Left Front parties was the first alliance which sent letters to all the CMs requesting to not implement the CAA.  Despite potential risks of their only govt (Kerela) to be banished.

The Congress is uninterested in leading any serious movement against CAA. All they do is call some half-hearted meetings that no one attends. The states with Congress govt do not play a frontal role to lead the protests in their states.

The Right understands this well. You don't see Liberal organisations being attacked. It is the Left orgainsations and unions that are being attacked by the Right.

Still, the Liberal organisations are acting as if they are the one doing all work. Liberalism is the political wing of capitalism. It inherently leans rightward (since going left is opposing capitalism). Their enlightened centrist attitude (""both sides are wrong dude"") will never be able to remove the breeding grounds of fascism (which is capitalism). If we let Liberals act as if they are the saviours of India, fascism may eventually fall due to powerful protests, but its origin factors will never reduce. Neoliberalism will continue and eventually give rise to Fascism once more.",1579061690.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,19,7

At the same time, I understand why some people are offended by it even though I disagree with them - if they are against eating beef, then that's a personal choice and they should refrain from eating beef. Just because they're offended by eating beef doesn't mean that they can take away my right to eat beef.

Now, whenever I talk about eating beef, one of the first counter arguments I hear is ""What about pork? Are you willing to eat pork to prove a point? You're just eating beef to insult us"". First of all, I love pork and eat a ton of it. Second of all, how do I get it into these people's thick skulls that me eating pork doesn't mean the same thing to observant Muslims as eating beef does - Muslims that don't eat pork couldn't give a flying fuck about eating pork - they think it's an unclean animal and they don't give two hoots about me eating it but I have a die-hard sanghi ~~friends~~ acquaintances that don't understand this.

> The Kashmir Police on February 8 had sent an intelligence input to the CRPF, BSF, ITBP, SSB, Army and the Air Force warning of a possible IED attack, according to a letter written by the state police Inspector General. 

https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/national/intelligence-warning-of-ied-attack-was-sent-to-crpf-other-agencies-a-week-before-terror-attack

Earlier, CRPF had requested for airlifting of troops which was denied by MHA. 

> We wrote to our CRPF headquarters requesting them to provide us facilities to transit jawans by air. But nothing happened. No one bothered to reply to us.

https://www.thequint.com/news/india/pulwama-terror-attack-crpf-request-air-transit-of-jawans-ignored

It is shocking that no chargesheet has been filed yet. 

> The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has not filed a chargesheet in the Pulwama terror incident, nine months after the attack took place, as none of the key suspects are alive.

https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nia-has-not-filed-chargesheet-in-pulwama-attack/article30307438.ece

Questions that remain unanswered:

1. How come the terrorist knew the timing of the troops movement? It wasn't a routine convoy move. 

2. 80 kgs of high grade RDX is said to have been used. How did this miss the radar of Intelligence Agencies?

I have observed that the thought analyses of so called educated Indians is far less than Americans. I am beginning to wonder if we have lesser IQ(currently). My theory is stemmed from the following :

1. We never came out of our communal sentiments (caste based) even though we are aware it is all nonsense . We never even try to address it within ourselves nor we read extensively about its origins in school. Most general population never wonder why do we have ""classes"" within the same race? It is peculiar that communal sentiment is stronger than National sentiment. People actively participate in these sentiments.
2. We submit too much to ""gurus"" without making thorough investigation of them. We support their pseudo science because it protects our insecurities . We are fine with them occupying lands, controlling wealth , preaching enormous ignorance . They give lame explanations of effect of Saturn on some temples and why women should don't enter them. We never question the science behind it.
3. Our theatre arts (cinema ) is at its worst. We are such snowflakes that directors lives are threatened if they take movies that ""hurt"" communal sentiments. We don't want to hear truths . Or alt least look at it and judge it ourselves without making a huge political stunts. And unfortunately people support it. They have to always distort the truth to please the audience. What kind of cowardice is that? What's the purpose of the art?
4. There are no Science-fiction movies that can be thoughtful...like Inception, Martian or Interstallar . Most Indians don't even discuss these movies, let alone produce them. I wonder how much of our population even understand them or want to watch them?
5. We read more of current day to day politics than any other books out there. Never try to understand to go and think beyond. There is more interest in vanity (flaunting their cars, assets ) than acquiring knowledge.
6. Very egoistic and arrogant  but surprisingly devotees of either politicians , gurus or heroes. Their bhakti is unmatched to any other world .
7. They hesitate to question anything ancient and sacred. Lack of analytical skills?....
8. Our politicians represent our moral sense and values.
9. They believe that being educated is reading bunch class text books and ace the exams. Parents are extremely proud of their kids achievements and very ashamed of those who are academically backward( I mean those who can't boring drill for hours??)
10. They don't even read  their scriptures but have a very high feeling of them. The question is they don't read but yet they feel proud of it..

This is a serious question. Indians are not known to truly fight. Everything is self-defense.

The problem is it’s not truly effective unless you spar with others. Most fighters don’t know how to punch nor receive heavy blows. Our ways of fighting are primitive.

Even the “professional” fighters in Super fighting league aren’t effective. They wouldn’t stand a chance against big fighters in the MMA. We don’t have any heavy-weights in India. This means someone who is 6 ft +, and weighs more than 200 pounds.

There are so many fighters, from cities, slums and villages but they are never spotted for real fights.

7370,"I made my dad switch from Zee news to NDTV News: Step by step guideLately, I saw posts on r/India in which some folks were annoyed with their parents for their andh Bhakti. Some replies to these posts were suggesting to cut off the parent and living independent life. I found people who suggest cutting off from parents have serious issues with their parents, have rosy pictures of living independently or never raised any kid Hence they lack patience. 

Instead of getting agitated by my parents for watching Zee News, I treated it as an addition and followed principles from “**The Power of Habit**” book by Charles Duhigg to change their habit. 

We have a few habits because we look for rewards when some condition triggers us to follow any routine. We can’t stop bad habits abruptly. If we want to change our habits, either we need to change our actions on triggers or look for elsewhere for rewards. You can find more information in the following link. 

[https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/](https://charlesduhigg.com/how-habits-work/)

Nowadays, Due to the Internet and all streaming services with their autoplay, we have a never-ending source of entertainment and we hardly spend with our dear once. I used to sit in my room once I get back from the office, open my laptop/mobile and watch some series while he continued watching his daily dose of news. The venom of hatred was spread every day. I started sitting in the living room with my laptop and instead of watching some series, I would do browse random stuff. Read the newspaper etc. while keeping an eye on stuff shown on TV. I kept my cool and observed his pattern. Every day he would switch on tv at 9 to check top news of the day and then kept it on one channel only. 

Instead of counter-attacking the stupid arguments on TV, I was a neutral person and shown apathy to discussions. During the break, once I said to him ( with a heavy heart ) do you think I get time to think about some else’s problem when there is nobody to solve my issues/stress. These all are distracting us from our struggles. Then I shared some stressful incidences in my office. Some other day I discussed keeping cool in traffic jams while others are driving rashly. These discussions were beneficial as they reestablished our relationship. The so-called generation gap became less. He had more understanding of my daily struggle and was concerned about my stress.

Sometimes I used to ask to switch off the TV when arguments became shouting matches by telling him that I am having a headache or I had a bad day at work so need some rest. At times, I suggested that mom puts so much effort to make delicious dinner, we ignore it and watch anger-provoking content. Mom was on my side that day and she asked him to change channel or swift off the TV. Once I told my parents that I got won coupons online and took them for dinner outside. We discussed nonpolitical stuff such as food, ambiance, etc.

**To change our bad habits, we need to replace them with good habits**. So I started channel surfing whenever there was an ad break. I would switch to Zee Classic, **The Golden Era With Annu Kapoor** on Mastiii, Singling competition reality shows, National Geographic Channel for some quieter content. Never change the channel midway while the program is going on. Keep the audio on during ads and switch them when any annoying ads come in. Trust me, News channels play only annoying ads. At times I played old songs performances by his favorite singers on Chromecast. During channel surfing, I used to stay on NDTV before moving to another channel. Gradually he started hating the cringe music played between top news and liked Ravish’s Style of news anchoring. 

Yesterday I got surprised when we were watching Old songs and he asked to switch the channel to NDTV. He stayed on NDTV for half-hour 

Thankfully my dad is not hardcore Bhakt. But I acted before it was too late. It needs patience and persistence but definitely doable. ",1579030019.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,49,262

Something as simple as renewing a passport takes bribes and grovelling at the feet of these clowns and the incompetent cops. When will this country stop being a shithole?Disclaimer: I'm pretty much as ""coconut"" as it gets. Brown on the out, white on the in. Born in India, left when I was a couple of months old, yada yada yada, so I'm (unfortunately) an Indian citizen. Don't speak the languages, except for a smattering of Hindi.

HOWEVER, I'm now in India, and needed to get my passport renewed. What a fucking nightmare. But that's ok. I went through with the ""tatkaal"" process, and after some prodding to get some ""verification certificate"", ended up having to pay a ""premium"" (bribe) before I could get the passport.

Ok, cool. So I just had the last step to be taken care of - the ""police verification"". So this inspector comes to my place, sits down like he fucking owns the house, and starts demanding documentation after documentation to verify that I'm the actual tenant in the house. No prob officer, I've got a fucking stack right here for you to go through.

And then...he demands money ""or else I will cancel the passport."" What the fuck is this shit? Does this happen on a daily basis with you guys? How do you guys handle such fucked up, blatant corruption? What the fuck?!! I gave the bastard 500 rupees, and can only pray that he does not ""cancel"" the fucking passport.

Totally fucking disgusted. The system in this entire fucking country is designed to hinder progress and frustrate the living fuck out of anyone.

I can't wait to leave. What a shithole.

7452,"Need help on careers to choose in MNC/govt job.Hello everyone

I need some career + study advice. I am sharing a brief story about myself and my scores so far. Please share your experiences and opinions.

Scores
10th: 8CGPA
12th: 54%
BBA graduate: 52%

My scores are low but my passion was gaming, I’ve voluntarily worked with a few gaming organisations and later decided to switch to corporate world and give it a try. I thought the time and hard work I was investing in gaming could be better used in studying for PG or learning and exploring different fields.
Currently working with a mass recruiter as HR customer support.
I know I can work hard and I am very disciplined as well, I would give my 100% in whichever field I may go in.
Only problem is that people/companies in this country judge everyone on the basis of school and college grades which are low.
My concern here is should I give improvement exam for last semester of BBA or do some additional courses online like Analytic or Finance that could cover up my scores.
I also need some help with career guidance whether to go for a govt job or MBA.
My interests are now nothing as I am ready to learn and put my time in any field/job I get it.
Previously it was playing games or organising tournaments.

TLDR: Confused with future, have less grades. Probably not even eligible for govt jobs.

I would appreciate each one of you sharing thoughts and your experiences.
If someone could also share good career counsellor in New Delhi.",1578959567.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,2

Over this long  period of time whenever i had selected unregistered post as the shipping method ,99% of the cases i didn't get the item delivered .I have lost more than 60 small items like this.Since those were very low priced items like $1-$3 i didn't give much efforts on them. For few items i got the refund from the seller. And i should mention that they shipped the items for every single incidents ,so it's not their fault. All of them were  lost when they entered in india. so my question is  **Is there anything that can be done for undelivered parcels sent via unregistered India post shipping ?**

I had visited my local post office several times but they said they cannot do anything.Since these are unregistered items ,so obviously non trackable .That is why i can not point finger at anyone .How can i approach to higher authority regarding this ?

1. Arrive at Delhi
2. Delhi to Leh and back by flight (1 week)
3. Auli, Spiti Valley, Shimla, Manali
4. Dharamshala

&#x200B;

My main goals are:

1. Experience snow (I've never seen snow in my life)
2. Another redditor recommended Auli (valley of flowers). I also want to see Spiti valley... It is so beautiful in photos.
3. Shimla and Manali are optional at the moment. 

&#x200B;

My questions are:

1. Shimla & Manali... Are they worth visiting compared to other places? Does it snow there?
2. Should I include Rohtang Valley and Solang Valley as well? I just want to experience snow. Can I experience it in any of the above places? 
3. How can I reach from one place to another in the above list? What would be the most sensible route (order of visiting) and modes of transport between each place?",1578994176.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,17

*The most effective pose is one in which there seems to be the least of posing, and Jawahar had learned well to act without the paint and powder of an actor … What is behind that mask of his? … what will to power? … He has the power in him to do great good for India or great injury … Men like Jawaharlal, with all their capacity for great and good work, are unsafe in a democracy. He calls himself a democrat and a socialist, and no doubt he does so in all earnestness, but every psychologist knows that the mind is ultimately slave to the heart and that logic can always be made to fit in with the desires and irrepressible urges of man. … Jawahar has all the makings of a dictator in him — vast popularity, a strong will, ability, hardness, an intolerance*

I don’t know if it’s allowed to share a post like this on here, but I wanted to share my recent trip to India where spent ~10 days in (25th November - 5th December) and visited five different cities. I started my trip in Mumbai, then went to Pune, Jaipur, Agra, and finished in New Delhi. It was my first time in the country and I absolutely fell in love with it. The people were very hospitable, the food was amazing, and sights were marvelous!


Here's my photo album from my solo trip to India: https://imgur.com/a/catHTjw

The album took me about a month to complete as it contains 164 photos with as much detail as I could recall. I’ve created albums like this for my past trips of Russia and Mexico City. Compared to those, this has the most writing I’ve ever done. I don’t necessarily know why I wrote so much. I sort of just started and then didn’t stop due to consistency.



A summarization of my favorites:

-Favorite city: Delhi

-Favorite food: Pav Bhaji

-Favorite attraction: Tie between Taj Mahal and Tomb of Akbar the Great

-Favorite tour: Offbeat Mumbai walking tour

-Favorite experience: Too many, but meeting and hanging out with people.

-Weirdest experience: Random people asking (and sometimes not asking) to take selfies with me.


If you have questions I'll do my best to answer.

A year back I was in Ooty and bought a bunch of spice from there. I think the shop was called Nilgiri spices or something. Those were some of the best spice I ever got my hands on and I'm nearly reaching the end of the supply. I fear my curries and biryani will never be the same again :P

Now I'm overseas and it would be a long time before I'll be back in Ooty. Can someone suggest an online store where I can buy some real Nilgiri spices from? 

It would be good if they can ship overseas but not compulsory as I can collect them on my next trip to India.

7744,"What ever happened to peace and love for all mankind eh?For a long, long while now I have held my peace and kept silent over everything that is going on in this country, but no more. I will probably get a lot of hate for this but fuck it if you don't make a few enemies along the way you're either a coward or worse! 


Before I begin let me make my biases clear right away. I am a social democrat leaning left of centre with an enlightened, globalist perspective on how we, as a species, should live. And ""as a SPECIES"" is pretty fucking important here because I look at things from the perspective of a global identity not a national, regional, communal or religious based one. So let's begin.


Right from the outset the Modi government has made it clear that it aims to be an authoritarian and absolutist one and will tolerate no criticism or opposition. The very fact that they vehemently opposed the supreme court's verdict on making privacy a fundamental human right is an indicator of this. This administration does not intend to respect the privacy of its citizens. While some may argue that that is a cultural phenomenon - after all, we ourselves are bombarded with questions about intimate aspects of our life from neighbours and even strangers like it's no big deal - this cannot be allowed to continue at the level of the state if only because of the vastly greater damage a state can do with that amount of information. Information right as a whole I believe should be a fundamental human right or at the very least come under the umbrella of privacy rights but that aside the fact that this administration has a Big Brother attitude towards governance is worrying. 


With regards to the NRC this is a clear aspect of it, especially the fact that religion seems to be a major aspect of what the NRC is about. The CAA is even less subtle and clearly demarcates the citizenship of India on solely religious lines. India is a secular country and from what I can see more and more people are against that. It appears to me that a substantial number of Indians, if not the majority of them, want India to be a purely Hindu state where they tolerate a few minor religions, with the stark exception of Islam, but with a Hindu majority in governance, not so different from today but much worse. And yes all kinds of reasons can be used to justify it from illegal immigration to terrorism but that does not change the fact that this is clearly intended to divide. And the sad part is many people do not care about that anymore and are shamelessly and openly supporting the division of India on religious lines (again). The idea of a secular India seems to be loosing popularity with each passing day and nationalism is the key to the hate that's spewing forth in this country today. It's blatant Xenophobia and most people seem to be OK with it.


Propaganda is an amazing thing. Most people who do not have critical thinking skills (and that IS most people) are vulnerable to it. Propaganda was instrumental in the rise of the Nazi party in Germany. The Reich Propaganda minister Josef Goebbles used it expertly to instill feelings of nationalism and national pride in the citizens of Germany. But it was more than that. The definition of nationalism was expanded to incorporate the party itself such that any attack on the Nazi party was an attack on the nation itself. And look at the amount of hate, genocide, destruction and chaos that followed. The scary thing is Hitler and Nazi Germany are seen by the far right in India as heroes and role models. It might be because they opposed the British, as did we, and gave lip service to the cause of Indian Independence. But it does not excuse the willful murder of millions of Jews, Slavs, Poles, Romani and homosexuals because of this unscientific and divisive policy of social Darwinism: the idea of a Master Race. I remember seeing a state syllabus text book in India for junior school children where Hitler is mentioned in the same vein as Mandela and Gandhi as an individual who is to be admired for his leadership skills. It completely ignored the fact that he destroyed his country and caused the deaths of an entire generation of Germans not to mention the loss of life and property and brutal punishments meted out against the German population by their enemies, primarily the Russians. This man who is reviled in every corner of the world, is seen as the true embodiment of evil, is seen as a hero by some in india. 


And yes, what I'm saying is the Modi government has parallels with the Nazi party. He is seeking to be authoritarian, has equated support to him as being nationalistic and opposition as being anti national, he has divided the population on religious lines as opposed to racial ones but divided it nonetheless and is seeking to expel the minority of his dislike from the country exactly like the Nazi party. There are clear elements of Fascism here.


Nationalism was a good thing in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. When the idea emerged in the age of enlightenment, it gave people an identity that could unify them. Until then their sense of identity was regional or tied to whatever house was ruling the country but nationalism united the population in ways nothing else could. It led directly to the French revolution and the unification of Germany and Italy in the 1800s. In the 20th century it allowed asian and african countries to shake off their colonial masters and rule themselves. It united people who were otherwise divided and gave them a common focal point for their identity. 


And yet for all the good it did in unifying people, it also has another side where it is a tool for division and hate. It was put to this use by Nazi Germany and is being wielded the same way by the Modi Government. In the hands of the far right, nationalism no longer unites but divides. It is a potent tool for discrimination. With it the state can chip away at fundamental rights with ease because all they have to do is whip up the country in a nationalistic fervour and make themselves the focus of it. That way any opposition to the governments is opposition to the country. The government has to do little then to silence their critics because the majority of the population will take on that task themselves. This gives them far more power over the population than any other government that is answerable to the people. Therein lies the death of democracy and the rise of tyranny. The same fate that Socrates warned us about thousands of years ago. 


I am no doubt aware that this rather scathing criticism of Modi will brand me as anti-national in the eyes of the far right. I would argue that I am in fact far more of a nationalist and patriot than those who would denounce me because I am not blindly loyal to Modi. I am loyal to democracy, the constitution and the rights of man guaranteed within it regardless of religion or ethnicity or gender. That is the India I am loyal to. Not one man or one party but a system where the government is answerable and accountable to the people. An unrealistic ideal I know but not something that is impossible given a few decades of work. 


I see things from the perspective of mankind as a whole. Nationalism is an antique concept in the 21st century and should be left behind in the previous millennium. It only serves to discriminate and make it a us versus them scenario. It makes things black and white while ignoring the fact that nothing is ever that binary. The world we are living in today, there is no ""them"". It's just us. We humans are in this together now regardless of nationality, race, age, gender or religion. What happens in one part of the world affects all of us more today than ever before. The thing I've noticed about most people is their sense of identity stems from the small first and the big next. What I mean is their sense of identity starts first with their family, then their community or caste, then their village, their region, their religion, their state and ends with their country. It does not go beyond that. I am the opposite. I identify as a human first, then an Indian and finally as a Bangalorean. The locus of my identity is tied to my humanity first and foremost. And more and more people like me are emerging everyday what with how interconnected the world is. So from this perspective nationalism is discrimination because it makes it an us versus them case, even more so when a ruling party equates supporting the party with supporting the country. There is only Us. And humanity can only move forward from the brutal wars of the last millennia and progress as a species if we abandon the binary mentality that ideas like nationalism, racism, sexism, casteism and xenophobia foster.


On a side note, I've noticed that people also seem to have a problem with ideals of socialism, which I've come to believe they have mistakenly equated with communism. This I believe comes from binary thinking again (if you're not right wing then you must be communist). But there is a spectrum to it and democratic socialism does far more good to a society than right politics or communism. I am strongly anti-communist but I'm also anti-right. All you have to do is look at the systems in places like Scandinavia, Canada and NZ to know the beneficial aspects of democratic socialism. These countries are listed consistently as the happiest countries in the world for good fucking reason. It's worth emulating what they're doing.

7745,"Vegetarianism in India has more to do with caste hierarchy than love for animals
Why do vegetarians in India prefer social distance from non-vegetarians? A look at caste-wise food preferences could provide some insights. As is common knowledge, the ranking of castes is mostly influenced by purity of occupation and diet. In caste-society, to achieve purity of body and spirit, it is necessary to be a vegetarian and religious simultaneously – something best embodied by a Brahmin.

The percentage of non-vegetarians among Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, both for men and women, is much higher than among those who are not from these communities. And in the latter group, the highest incidence of vegetarianism is found among Brahmins at almost over 50%. The higher the caste, the greater the possibility of them being pure vegetarians.

The burden of diet-purity and vegetarianism is, however, more on women than men.

Broadly, present-day vegetarianism in India constitutes a form of moral power of minority within Hindus, with such a power being forced on the non-vegetarian majority – with their consent. This new sociality is a sign of progress in modern caste belief where the seductive power of vegetarianism and its associated purity travels seamlessly across bodies and spaces without dissent.

How fragile must the morals of the vegetarian castes be if they feel threatened by the introduction of eggs for poor children in schools? The morals of Indian vegetarians continue to be based less on compassion for humans and animals, and more driven by ideas of hierarchy and purity. In this scheme of hierarchy, one who eats beef is placed at the lowest rung. Like humans of caste, not all animals carry equal sympathy: there exists some hierarchy where the cow (indigenous, not jersey) takes the highest sacral form compared to the rest. Gandhi improvised his vegetarianism through inflicting violence and control on the self. Present-day caste-subjects and their vegetarianism, however, thrive on violence, both on the self and others. The state across India through various governments has mostly been party to this process, promoting the hegemony of misguided vegetarianism.",1578977750.0,#b8001f,Food,light,343,692

The Rajya Sabha on December 11, 2019 passed the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, with 125 votes in favour and 99 against. The Bill for the first time allows citizenship on the basis of religion to six communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. 

The Bill amends the Citizenship Act, 1955, and for the first time, will grant citizenship on the basis of religion to non-Muslim communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who entered India

Know the difference between NRC and CAA Bill


If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow.

As soon as the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed in both houses of Parliament and given Presidential nod making it a law, loud murmurs started about another move- the National Register of Citizens or NRC. What is NRC and does it really create a problem together with CAA, here's what you need to know: 

What is NRC?
NRC is the National Register of Citizens. The NRC identified illegal immigrants from Assam on the Supreme Court's order. This has been a state-specific exercise to keep its ethnic uniqueness unaltered. But ever since its implementation, there has been a growing demand for its nationwide implementation. Now, many top BJP leaders including Home Minister Amit Shah have proposed that the NRC in Assam be implemented across India. It effectively suggests to bring in a legislation that will enable the government to identify infiltrators who have been living in India illegally, detain them and deport them to where they came from. 

Who stands to lose?
The proposed Bill, which till now remains just a proposal, if implemented will target illegal immigrants in India. But Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis coming from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh won't be affected, if they claim they have arrived India after fleeing religious persecution. Which essentially means, if a nationwide NRC comes in as proposed, any illegal immigrant from other than Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, will be affected. And as for those three nations, people coming from there who belong to the Muslim community will also be affected as they are not included in the Citizenship Amendment Act.

What will happen to the affected?
As proposed, if a nationwide NRC comes in place, the affected will be detained and taken to large detention centres, as it is happening in Assam. After that, the Ministry of External Affairs will get in touch with the concerned nations. If the details of the detained are matched and accepted by the concerned nations, deportations will follow. The politics of NRC BJP chief Shah has been raising the pitch for a nationwide NRC for some time now. As late as this October, Shah raised the matter in West Bengal, not far from Assam. He had said: ""We had brought the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Rajya Sabha, but the TMC MPs did not allow the Upper House to function. They did not allow the bill to be passed, and due to this, there are people in our country who are yet to get the Indian citizenship."" In Haryana, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar too made the promise of bringing the NRC in the state during his election campaigning. Even Mohan Bhagwat, the RSS supremo has been pitching for the same, though behind closed doors. Whether a nationwide NRC will come in place or not is a premature question to answer. But going by the speed the government is moving in bringing some rather bold legislations, like abrogation of Article 370 in the monsoon session of Parliament and CAB in the winter session, a pan-India NRC Bill in the next Parliament session won't be a far fetched idea.

>दिल्लीच्या लक्ष्मी आगरवाल च्या चेहऱ्यावर ३२ वर्षीय नदीम खान ने अॅसीड फेकले होते. त्यावेळी तीचे वय १५ होते.  
चित्रपटात अॅसिड फेकणाऱ्याचे नाव दाखवले आहे राजेश शर्मा. तो कपाळावर टिळा लावतो.

>डॉक्टर अथक प्रयत्न करून तीला वाचवतात. तीचे आई वडील परमेश्वराची प्रार्थना करतात.
पण चित्रपटात दाखवण्यात आले आहे की डॉक्टर सांगतात की ती जगण्याची उमेद नाही. तेव्हा तीचे आई वडील दर्ग्यावर जाऊन मन्नत मागतात आणि ती बरी होते.  

>खऱ्या घटनेत पिडीतेचे नातलग, शेजारी, सरकार वगैरे तीची मदत करतात.  
चित्रपटात दाखवण्यात आले आहे की तीचे हिंदू शेजारी तीला नावे ठेवतात पण एक मुस्लिम मित्र तीची खूप मदत करतो.

>हिंदू बहुसंख्य असलेल्या देशात अशी लबाडी दाखवणारे चित्रपट येतात आणि हिंदू ते पहायला देखील जातात.

Translation:

>The changes in the story of Deepika Padukone's upcoming movie

>32-year-old Nadeem Khan had thrown acid on the face of Delhi's Lakshmi Agarwal. At that time she was 15 years old.  
The name of the acid thrower is shown in the movie, Rajesh Sharma. He even applies a tilak on his forehead.

>Doctors try to save her. Her parents pray for her survival.  
But the film shows that the doctor says she has no hope of survival. Then her parents go to a dargah and beg, and she survives miraculously.

>In the real event, the victim's relatives, neighbors, government, etc. help her.
The film shows that her Hindu neighbors hate her, but a Muslim friend helps her a lot.

>In a country where the majority of the Hindus come to see such films, the Hindus also go to see them.

#**The actual story shown in the movie**

Point 1: The attackers name in the movie is Bashir Khan and his sister, not Rajesh Sharma. Rajesh is her boyfriend, not involved in the attack whatsoever. 

Point 2 doesn't happen whatsoever in the movie.

Point 3, exactly the opposite thing is shown in the movie. Bashir Khan himself comes to see her in the hospital, he doesn't help her whatsoever, infact he's there to check if she will accuse him of his crime. There are no muslim friends helping her, only her lawyer.

&nbsp;

Which way do you people store your drinking water in your house? 

I get two 20 litres cans delivered to my home twice a week. We're a family of 2 so its enough for now. I am sure many of you also rely on such bottled water for drinking purposes. Is the water in these cans processed/purified in any way? It is, right? I have seen large, tall steel tanks in the water processing plants in my locality. I am guessing those are the purification tanks.

How do you store this water? Do you let it remain in the plastic cans only for the entire duration, with a plastic dispenser for withdrawing it? [This system basically](https://www.amazon.in/KTC-Plus-Transparent-Plastic-Dispenser/dp/B07P55X9Z4/ref=asc_df_B07P55X9Z4/?tag=googleshopdes-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=397080458762&hvpos=1o3&hvnetw=g&hvrand=832758887345892535&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1007743&hvtargid=pla-815745027835&psc=1&ext_vrnc=hi). I had that system in my bachelor days, cheap and easy, but I think its not very healthy. 

I know many must be having Kent, Aquaguard, etc systems at their homes. I have been hearing negative remarks for such RO or any other technology water purification systems too, major points being that they are not required at every place , only the heavily polluted ones; they strip away the good minerals too; a lot of water is wasted. So I'm not considering getting that installed. Feel free to change my opinion.


Does anyone have ceramic water purifiers? The chalk candle ones, like [this](http://archive.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/point-use-water-treatment/ceramic-candle-f)? These used to be fairly common in my childhood, but I don't see them that much now. From what I've read, they're pretty good at removing bacteria and protozoans, but not viruses and chlorine.

Does anyone have any experience with them?

If you have any other method, like using earthen pots, please do tell. Also tell the maintenance/periodic cleaning, etc involved if any.

When I was growing up I had posters of ""Hum Mandir Wahin Banaenge"" at home ( RSS slogan of building a temple in place of Babari Masjid). My uncles were hardcore ABVP members.

For as long as I know my peeps voted for BJP and even though had Muslim acquaintances and always behaved well with them. My English tutor was a Muslim. But beneith the surface they had this  very clear mistrust/apprehension/dislike of Muslims.

But here was I, taught that we all one, Hindus, Muslim, Sikh, Isai; Aapas mein Hain Bhai Bhai. So I grew up questioning everything. I wasn't winning any popularity contests as I hung with pretty much anyone whom I found great. And my parents werent happy as I had Muslims at home and at my cricket circle.

The same continued when I left home for higher studies. I was often fighting for my Ahrar Bhai (from Lucknow). He did not eat at certain restaurants, so we didn't too and it was perfectly fine. The same continued when I moved to the big city for work. My circle included Muslims and if anything they are still my best friends.

So when someone says that he is any less Indian than I am, my blood boils over (I don't live in India anymore). I will go to war with anyone who dares touch them. At this time, it is even more important than people stand up. If I was in India I would be going to every possible agitation possible. 

And for all those folks who really believe in the shit BJP and the media is peddling, I feel so sad for you. How deeply rotten your heart must be for not feel for fellow humans. I pity you.

He stood up against ragging in the college saying every student has the right to a safe academic environment. He actively took part in the college debate club events and encourage debate, questioning.

Now he is a rabid bhakt talking about ""preserving India's demographics"" and ""JNU urban naxals"" who are ""damaging servers which I am ignoring"" when I try to discuss with him about students being attacked. He doesn't even see the cognitive dissonance there, and shames students trying to discuss with him to ""shut up"" and ""listen to his views cuz he has seen more of the world than them.""

My dad, once spat on Congress for their corrupt practices now willfully ignores BJP's scams, saying they are foreign controlled narratives. He ignores Electoral Bond discussions saying that ""we are not lawyers so can't understand all this legalese and for sure things aren't so bad"". He ignores economic slowdowns saying it's happening all over the world, while it isn't. 

Yesterday I saw a facebook post ""Akahay Kumar may be Canadian, but he is still better than our own Indian antinationals who want to destroy our country."" I saw posts saying how Amitabh Bachchan is a saint for helping the last rites of his domestic help's father or something, when Panama papers show his involvement in massive tax evasion efforts.

Even many of those who are shaming BJP today in my friends list are hard core Congress supporters, and will not criticize so heavily if Congress did the same bullshit. Some like Shiv Sena have suddenly become secular. Many active Modia reporters have suddenly converted, perhaps sensing the change in viewership demands and general public notions. 

Its weird. This is the time to keep an eye out. Not everyone in support of apparently good things was in for truly moral reasons, many were using that as a front for Congress hatred. Same is the case with many BJP haters of today. The need of the hour is to keep our eyes open, to always remember the historical context of people's opinions and look for consistency in their outlook. Heck I've applied this to myself and found many areas where I am biased.

7991,"[P]Pro-CAA supporters need to convince an Anti-CAA like me to join their side.So I'm not beating around the bush and don't wanna explain anything about my Anti-CAA side. Because I believe it is a no brainier why I chose Anti-CAA, because of trust issues regarding this government since they came to power and Demonitization. You all called that move so pro development, anti-corruption, anti-naxals and pro economy. Today, none of you could ever prove those lies you told in 2016/2017. Then 2018 and 2019, I couldn't even find you people to debate about Demo. Not a single person.

So now that you all found NRC/CAA planted onto your brain like Demo, you have given no thought but to go ahead and support it, without understanding what that it says. The Modi/Shah can never be wrong belief is strong inside of you, when each of their moves proved to be toxic and futile. Still I'll let that slide. Like always, we the opposition citizens are wrong. Fine.

You say we are wrong again, because we are spreading misinformation that CAA is very small registration information and has nothing to do with NRC, which will further enhance our standard of living. We will become 5 Trillion economy and all our kids will study in Harvard and we will drive Mercedes. Yes, some of your pro-caa people are telling that to illiterates and common citizens who are not politically sound. It is us who are spreading misinformation and scaring Muslims about this bill and using them. Because it is not us who are saying ""Now you mullas will get what you deserve"" "" you katuas are not Indians and will be thrown out soon"" "" Muslims were never Indians from the beginning"" "" only Pure Hindus will live in India"" and so many Pro-CAA slogans you can easily find out around your people, your pro-caa people I mean. It's like theres 100 different agenda based Pro-CAA people. And you are not speaking in one voice, what is your correct stand?

Because you see, Anti-CAA has only one stand and one stand only, Amit Shah and Modi does not use Muslims and Buddhists when they say ""Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis do not have to fear about their citizenship."" 

It does not even say that Hindus are not in Danger too. There are 500 millions of people who do not have documents of their grandparents, how are you gonna convince the Hindus, Sikhs and others that they are safe? 

You cannot even tell your own Pro-caa people to stop spreading misinformation and stop abusing Muslims and others. Because you say it is not your job to correct them, but you are trying to correct Anti-CAA people? With what idea, that we are  buncha school kids?  None of your stand seems convincing enough, I mean how can one prove a poison ivy is edible? You people have great difficulties in proving your own self by supporting this bill? You have your own doubts but you are so afraid of these poisonous people that they will throw you out of your stand, you seem to convince us that we Anti-CAA are misleading, but look at your own people who are spreading communal poison everyday? Is this your way to convince the people? 

To make the matter even worse, you cannot even correct your own ministers who are spreading communal hate on public, and yet you say pro-caa is harmless? For God's sake, get your own people United first and have a one voice, like us Anti-CAA people do.

Okay, so guys I was at the Delhi airport, and if you have been there, you must have noticed the dustbins there. They are segregated in a blue colour dustbins, which are used for plastic stuff and packaging, and then there is a green one for discarded food items. 
    So whilst waiting for my flight I noticed a man come and empty those cans. He casually grabbed the contents of BOTH the cans into his hands and landed them inside a  huge yellow trashcan. I was genuinely  so confused I thought maybe there are no bags inside them so maybe he took it like that and so I took a peek inside, and there was a plastic bag inside both of them. Perhaps the money is short to waste those plastic bags. 
This man singlehandedly destroyed my impression that I was helping the environment by segregating my trash of a place I visit insubstantially while I continue to use plastic at home. Oh well. 

And btw, few moments before that man grabbed the contents to feed into his yellow mythbusting trashcan, I saw a babu arrive and spit his paan into it, so that's that.",1578926684.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,1,12

So, I went to the bank and asked them to deactivate it. But the employee said that they could not do so because their ""system"" does not accept the deactivate requests somehow and it would only be deactivated if I close my account there. 
The account is only for the FDs that I have there. The credit and debit transactions are minimum. So there's no point of carrying a debit card for this account and be forced to make an annual payment for it. 

Can you guys suggest me what I should do here? 
Whom should I contact regarding this? If I file a complaint will there be any action taken against the employees.

These guys also forced me in the past to take those Pradhanmantri policies too the one with annual deductions of 12 Rs and 330 Rs by saying that it compulsory for every account holder to have these. After enquiring in the detail they told me that they have to do so because they have to complete their target and what not. At that time too we had some heated exchange of words. And now this ATM thing is utter bullshit too.

8049,"Just wanting to know how optimistic people are about the ongoing protests in India regarding CAA-NRC ? Do they think that by this (protests) there is going to be any change in the government implementation of these misguided/flawed policies?I have had this discussion with my girlfriend a lot of times regarding the NRC-CAA. 

She has been quite pessimistic since CAA was a bill. She has been saying this government isn't going to do anything about it. On the contrary I have been a bit optmistic regarding all this. Initially I thought that supreme court will intervene (knowing current president is a stamp man, no better than peon putting stamps for the officer). But it has been a month now. CAB become CAA and UP has already started the implementation.

Though there has been a lot of protest and uproar regarding the policies across India, the government conveniently ignored everything and carried on the implementation. 

I have been to both the protests - Jamia and Shaheen bagh, there always have been a huge gathering, esp. Shaheen bagh, which has been on for 24x7 since last one month. I have been challenging her that these people coming up for protest, specially the women, who has been the life of Shaheen bagh protest, has to look after their family as well, aren't doing this for fun. There must be a bit optmistic regarding the situation, giving there all. Although she has been going to protect regularly, she is still quite pessimistic regarding everything.

So I want to know, how many people actually see a hope to all the protests that has been happening across India. Is there a point to it ? Do you think, for once government, which should be for the people, will listen and bring down NRC implementation atleast ?

Is there any other reason/motivation to all the protest if government isn't going to budge regarding the implementation.

Is she being a realist and I'm still being naive believing in false hopes ?

PS: I have been hating the government since the start, not siding knowing all the chutiyapa this government is up to.

Update: goverment won't be changing their decision - we all know that for a fact, it's the supreme court's ruling that i wanted to emphasize upon. Will supreme court be making any decision regarding the CAA and NRC in the favour of people.

We recently sent our comments to the National Security Council Secretariat which invited [**public comments** ](https://ncss2020.nic.in/)for framing of the National Cyber Security Strategy 2020 (NCSS 2020). Our clear belief is that India requires to focus strongly on protecting its cyber assets and infrastructure. This has to be done in a manner in which we focus on creating an environment with the right incentives and grow a respect for individual privacy. 

More tangibly as we outline in our submission to achieve this we make five distinct reccomendations. 

* *Recommendation 1: Independent vulnerability testers and cyber security specialists are strategic national assets*  *–* India’s innovative and expanding community of security researchers is a net asset, for cybersecurity in both the public and private sectors. There should be a clear policy and standard operating procedure devised for departments to be notified by security researchers without the threat of civil or criminal prosecution.
* *Recommendation 2: Encryption protects India by protecting Indians* *–* The use of encryption has far too often come under political attack by some parts of the security ecosystem. In fact, failure to encourage and expand the usage of encryption technologies puts individual users at risk. Here millions of Indians who today conduct their lives through digital tools are also entry point vulnerabilities unless their devices are secured through encryption.
* *Recommendation 3: Encourage a strong data breach reporting mechanism in the Data Protection Act* *–* Data breach reporting under a data protection legal framework is immensely useful for enhancing cybersecurity.
* *Recommendation 4: Malware use makes all of insecure* *–* We further recommend that the use of malware should be clearly prohibited. The collection of, “Zero-day” hacks or the proliferation in the use of technical exploits to hack into the devices and digital services of Indians makes the nation insecure.
* *Recommendation 5: The open web is the secure web* *–* Today, there are both economic forces and regulatory suggestions that threaten the decentralised framework of the internet. This undermines not only the stability of the public core but has a negative impact on cyber security in real and tangible ways.

We will keep advocating for the safety of India by advocating for the rights of users to use technologies that will secure thier devices. Our submission also benefits from the growing community of supporters and experts includes many from the domain cyber security and their work is incredibly advancing the national interest. 

It is our earnest hope that the National Security Council Secretariat considers our submission for a cyber secure India that starts with securing Indians.

8237,"BJP is not wrong about CAA but NRC is unwanted and waste of moneyHear me out. India is already overpopulated with shit tons of people, jobs are difficult to come by.
Accepting minorities which are being killed violently in Muslim countries is commendable thing to do. This is same for Tibetan vs. Han Chinese.
Our Indian Muslims are well educated and at least have secular thinking which is missing in Muslims from other countries. 
CAA which accepts 5 religions except muslims is not a bad act, it does justice and saves lives. 
Example : If Parsees wouldn't have fled Iran in 1900s, the parsees would have been extinct by now. The same parsees who have become billionaires and flourished in our country. 

NRC on the other hand is going to fuck this country up, not just with religious shit but the cost of NRC is going to borne by the middle class and for a long time. It is going to be most expensive process ever took in the country is not going anywhere. 

Bangladesh which is also overpopulated is not going to accept the people back, these people (muslims) may lose the voting rights which will help BJP win easily. But the state of the economy should also be strong enough for that.",1578896495.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,27,5

8263,"The Davinder Singh arrest and the questions it raisesI am no national security expert, but I have a few questions from a layman's perspective on the arrest of [Davinder Singh](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/decorated-jammu-and-kashmir-cop-davinder-singh-caught-with-hizbul-terrorists-on-way-to-delhi-2162592?amp=1&akamai-rum=off)

Now, there are two scenarios here:

*1. He was working on government orders, perhaps leading a false flag attack 

*2. He had gone rogue and was acting on his own.

Let's look at these two scenarios:

Scenario 1. Within this scenario, there are two ways of looking at it

   *a) The government was up to something nefarious and had evil designs, or 

   *b) We take the state's actions to be in good faith and trust them they were doing it all in national 
       interest.


**Scenario 1(a):**

If he was acting on government orders, What was the plan? What did the government need Hizbul operatives for? What were the intentions? What could be the fallout? What other such designs does the government have? Who directs this deep state? How much information are we, as citizens, entitled to? Who will take responsibility for it?

**Scenario 1 (b):**
How the hell did he get arrested? How bad is their internal communication? Did some conscientious officer-in-the-know scuttle the operation?  Isn't this an utter failure of the government and its internal security machine? Who is going to answer for the incompetence? Who will take responsibility for?

**Scenario 2:**
He had gone rogue and was acting on his own.
Why didn't the IB, or whoever it is that keeps track, not find out about this? Was he not being watched, if he was why did they fail? Why was he given a medal last year?

And most grievous and egregious was this snippet of news from at least two sources:

>[Davinder Singh was posted with the anti-hijacking unit at Srinagar Airport and was one of the officials that received the 16-member delegation of foreign ambassadors which visited Kashmir on Thursday.](https://in.news.yahoo.com/kashmir-dsp-booked-under-unlawful-155506949.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGTtDnh_vI6yMTmnm-l0zk2XYCY31gpI-UaEkXvxYDp2xcdyd6mwZxaLokIot8a1hm98JLUs9MDDpQJgKxHCE7rn4vH0GXXuYR1knSxORZWzGWapucFrKdxgInMM2LpgHSCU7bgURaaTU4P9xSSmMcQyxNuac-gVaj5oMWfgwoET)


>[On Thursday, Singh had been photographed with foreign diplomats visiting Kashmir: he was part of the official team responsible for welcoming them.](https://scroll.in/article/949663/who-is-davinder-singh-the-kashmir-police-officer-arrested-in-a-car-with-hizbul-militants)


If he had indeed gown rogue, how the hell was he involved in such a high-profile visit? Can one imagine the fallout if there was an incident during the visit? Again, who will answer for this lapse? Who will take responsibility?


However we look at it, this is the absolute failure of our internal security set up and somebody in the government has to answer for this.

Now I am taking a little digression and trying to connect a few dots:

What is interesting is the Afzal Guru-Davinder Singh connection and how Singh was Guru's handler and as mentioned by Guru in his letter to his lawyer:

>[In 2004, in a letter to his lawyer Sushil Kumar, Afzal Guru, then lodged in Tihar Jail for his involvement in the Parliament attack, had said that “DSP Davinder Singh”, then posted with J&K Police’s Special Operations Group at Humhama, had asked him to “take Mohammad”, a Pakistani national identified as one of those who carried out the Parliament attack, “to Delhi, rent a flat for his stay and purchase a car for him”.](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/davinder-singh-2001-parliament-attack-afzal-guru-jammu-and-kashmir-police-6213441/)


Now, (tinfoil hat on) one historic event that sent all these wrecking balls flying was the botched up handling of the [Kandahar hijack episode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Airlines_Flight_814) and release of [Masood Azhar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masood_Azhar), who later founded Jaish-e-Mohammed and has been linked with all the major attacks on India since - [2001 Parliament attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Indian_Parliament_attack) (the Afzal Guru connection is important given he is an easy punching bag for the RW and the whole tukde tukde gang narrative is built on supposed pro-Afzal Guru slogans, as we know), [2008 Mumbai attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Mumbai_attacks), [2016 Pathankot attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Pathankot_attack) and the [2019 Pulwama attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Pulwama_attack) and there is also a tenuous link to the 9/11 attacks as was argued by:
>[who benefited from this, 2001 Indian Parliament, attack? The answer is the JeM’s friend and ally, Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda.](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/how-911-is-connected-to-december-13/) 



Now, there is one man who has had a hand in all this and has benefitted immensely from all of this (fixing my tinfoil hat again) - India's national security advisor Ajit Doval. He was the IB chief in 1999 and [was the lead negotiator of the four-member India team](https://www.outlookindia.com/newswire/story/ic-814-was-indias-diplomatic-failure-doval/671686).

There seem to be too many skeletons in Doval's closet and he has proven again and again that he is incompetent - Kandahar, Parliament attacks, Kashmir policy, Pulwama, Davinder Singh, the list goes on.

No matter who takes the fall for it, one man clearly has to be let go and that is Ajit Doval. He has to be investigated. In any functioning democracy, he would have been, at the least, sitting at home twiddling thumbs.

TL;DR: The arrest raises many questions and we, as citizens, deserve an answer. Also, our internal security system is broken with an absolutely incompetent man in charge.

8300,"Help needed regarding misuse of money and delay in partial withdrawal in my insurance policyHello,

I am not sure if this is the right place to ask this, but I would appreciate any help that I can get.

I have submitted a partial withdrawal form for my insurance policy on 13/11/2019. At the time of withdrawal, I was instructed that I will receive the amount in my account within 7 days. However, it wasn't. It was on 11/12/2019 that I received the amount. It took them almost a month to credit the amount and it wasn't even the complete amount. 

I was being reassured that I will receive the remaining amount within 7 days. When I asked why, the reason was either regulations or technical glitch. It was after almost 10 days that I found that the remaining amount has been converted to FD. 

It is pertinent to mention here that I have not signed any paper or given a vocal order to authorize the same. I have only signed the partial withdrawal form. After knowing the fact, I was furious at how I was being backchanneled and how an FD was opened from my money without any authorization. 

I visited the branch on 31/12/2019 to enquire the same and signed an application requesting to credit the remaining amount into my account. Upon my visit, I signed the application and inquired about the same, but they didn't provide me any answers. They didn't tell me who authorized this and how can an FD be opened when I have signed for a partial withdrawal from my policy. 

It has been 10 days since and the amount hasn't been credited into my account yet.

I need to know how to go about the issue and complain about this. What are the rules and things I need to know while raising this issue? Is there a time period from the insurance to settle the partial withdrawal claim? If yes, what happens when it extends? Further, I need to know how I should go about complaining regarding the FD issue.

I will appreciate any help I can get. And, let me know if any extra information is needed from me. Thank you!",1578807240.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,11

* 3.2. Should i apply for Flight tickets before Visa or Dummy Ticket as well?
* Should i apply from Thomas Cook? They are charging 2800rs Extra, but don't know if they bring any value to it.

8322,"Need to make a website for my business but I am terrified. Please help!Hi,

I have an opportunity which I want to work on but I have no idea how to go about it. I am not an IT guy.

I want to make a website on which I want to put courses (audio and video) which people can buy and then access. That is, people should be able to buy the course on the website and then be able to access the course.

I have so many questions.

1. Is a website like this major work? It will probably need to include a login ID and password system so that people can have all their purchased courses in one place. Plus the whole payment thing to enable them to buy courses. Is this normal or super complicated?

2. Will it be possible to keep the paid courses safe from piracy? Will there be ways to prevent people from saving the files?

3. What will be the cost of building something like this?

4. Who do I contact? How do I find someone competent and trustworthy to do this?

5. Will there be a recurring maintenance cost to be paid to the person who builds the website?

8326,"Abandoned, joylessI'm losing control of my life. My head is in a constant haze. Visiting medical professionals has been futile. What an utterly unproductive way to spend money that was. They tell me I'm fit but i just don't feel okay. I'm tired of being alone. Since childhood I've been taught that it's a worthless pursuit to seek validation from others. I was my source of approval. But now I've started feeling worthless. I have not a lot of friends, no romantic connection, a floundering career and a nebulous future.

I'm struggling to handle all of this. And then there's the burden of missed opportunities and loves that I lost. I look around me and see this sea of happy youngsters. I too crave to be a part of the crowd. It never is a good feeling to be a pariah. Oh I'm well aware that this post is a disjointed, incoherent weaving of words. But that's how I feel. I'm prostrated by these circumstances. To an observer I'm just another face in this sea of humanity.


 But there are multiple dimensions to that one forgettable face. Envy, inadequacy, despondence, ambition and a variety of feelings make me feel alive. At the risk of sounding misogynistic I see young women around me who have plenty of people at their beck and call. I can't imagine many of them feeling lonely. It's at such moments I realise how expendable and unimportant I am. Being seated at restaurants unaccompanied, facing that piercing gaze from someone judging me for eating alone is often too much to bear. 

The craving to experience some human touch, maybe a compliment is probably too much to ask for. Drinking and smoking have been my sanctuaries. I'm aware they're unhealthy but being with these thoughts is more toxic to me. Sometimes I choose to cry my heart out, pen my thoughts and acknowledge this brutal, unsympathetic world I reside in.",1578829479.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,9,3

Almost everything in any Indian language is hard to read (for me Hindi/Guj) and/or ugly to see (Tamil/Kannada etc). I did not care until I had to read and reply to emails. 

This is what the [font manager shows](https://i.imgur.com/CyG0ivJ.png) / [fails to show](https://i.imgur.com/bXmLplL.png). And this applies to all Indic fonts - Devnagari, Telugu, Kannada, Bengali etc

Tried using various fonts as defaults, no difference.
In Windows, the same fonts look beautiful using the same Font/Character encoding settings in browsers.

Edit: Fonts suck on other apps too like Telegram and other system apps. I also tried using Segoe UI systemwide but doesn't help.

Edit 2: I was able to fix fonts in Firefox but not on Brave. On Firefox it was a browser issue/bug (I already had selected proper fonts for each language).

Probably DejaVu and Free Sans are going to be default font. They are okay but replace them with Noto (or Lohit), more readable. If they are not preinstalled then [get them from here.](https://www.google.com/get/noto/)

I stay away from all nuts to be safe. 

I am going with my friend who knows how to speak but not write Hindi and Kannada, so it won’t be too bad while we’re in Karnataka, but we’re also planning to go to Tamil Nadu and Kerala and maybe some places that speak Telugu. Could you guys please help me translate the following phrase or a similar phrase to these languages: Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam. The phrase is, “I have a severe peanut and nut allergy. I will die if I eat a peanut or other nut or if I eat food that has been contaminated with peanut or nut products or peanut or nut oil.” 

My plan is to make a card that has this phrase in these languages and then also have pictures of the nuts with a giant X over them. 

I would appreciate any attempt at any of these languages. Please tell me if you’re positive that the translation is good or if it’s your best guess. I will take a best guess if I can’t get any native speakers who are positive.

8462,"A case study of The Rss the ideological parent of the bjp**India's current government is LITERALLY inspired by Nazism and European fascist movements of the 20th century.**

Actual historical facts and events coming at you:

There are 2 different(not always opposing) viewpoints in India, one is the Congress party, and one is the RSS. 

**[RSS](https://www.npr.org/2019/05/03/706808616/the-powerful-group-shaping-the-rise-of-hindu-nationalism-in-india)** = Hindu Nationalist organization, long time proponent of an exclusively Hindu India, that has been banned as a terror outfit 3 times.

**BJP** = India's current ruling party, founded in 1980 as the RSS's political wing (on the ideology of RSS).

Coming to RSS:

* Founded in 1925, the RSS [hates the Indian flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh#Opposition_to_the_National_Flag_of_India), hasn't hoisted it since 1950. They say India is a Hindu nation and its flag should be the symbol of Hindutva(Saffron). [It also opposes, and even initially refused to recognize, the secular Indian constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashtriya_Swayamsevak_Sangh#Opposition_to_the_Constitution_of_India) since it didn't include ancient Hindu law. It is a paramilitary organization that trains young men in camps to use weapons and physical force.

* The man who assassinated Gandhi [was an RSS member](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathuram_Godse) and [is adored by mainstream Hindu nationalist politicians today](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbWfA9IwmY0), who hate [Gandhi](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EB8WfJOXkAEJpYv?format=jpg&name=small) and [Nehru](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EB8PmCwXoAAYxz7?format=jpg&name=small) for creating a secular India. [Contemporary](https://twitter.com/EconomicTimes/status/1090556353515585536) Hindu nationalist leaders burn effigy of Gandhi.

* [RSS wants an exclusively Hindu India, where minorities are unequal to Hindus, if existant at all](https://countercurrents.org/2017/01/anti-national-rss-documentary-evidences-from-rss-archives).
* [The RSS is massively involved in rewriting Indian history](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/india-modi-culture/), where minorities are seen as the villains who invaded India and stopped its march from becoming a glorious nation, and the Hindu civilization as the protagonists.
* RSS and its leaders draw inspiration from right-wing, fascist European groups and their leaders, including Hitler and Mussolini, and their ideas of racial purity. Its long-time chief, M.S. Golwalkar, openly admired Hitler’s “final solution” and wanted to apply the same approach in India to eliminate the country’s minorities(Christians, Muslims, etc.)

* [Hindu nationalists believe in Akhand Bharat, a dream of ruling over all of South Asia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhand_Bharat#Contemporary_usage)
* Killed Gandhi, destroyed 400 year old Babri Mosque to rebuild an ancient Hindu temple, Gujarat Massacre, Communal Violence including mass riots, lynchings & rapes in the name of Love Jihad & Hindutva, deeply committed to creating a Hindu Rashtra. 
 
There are three characters who have inspired the RSS ideologically, V.D Savarkar, Keshav Hedgewar (1925-1940), and M.S. Golwalkar (1940-1973). Hedgewar translated the ideology of Savarkar while Golwalkar took it ultimate level of Nazism. 

Savarkar was a convicted criminal turned racist, militant, Hindu supremacist. He was [reported to have a homosexual relationship](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECETxoMU8AIsJWB?format=jpg&name=small) with the assassin of Gandhi, Godse.

Savarkar was a great admirer of [Hitler](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EB8N0yqWwAUifsi?format=jpg&name=small)  and [Mussolini](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EB8N1bwXkAAkIb7?format=jpg&name=900x900) who were the symbol of Nazism and Fascism respectively in that era. [He openly supported the agenda of racial supremacy and cultural nationalism](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EB8PDqfWwAIthfh?format=jpg&name=small).

These are direct quotes from the biggest Hindu nationalist leaders, who's words and writings found the basis of RSS and other Hindu nationalist movements:

>If we Hindus in India grow stronger, in time these Muslim friends of the League type will have to play the part of German-Jews instead - Savarkar

>There is nothing wrong if Muslims are treated as Jews were in Nazi Germany - Bal Thackeray

>If you take Mein Kampf and if you remove the word 'Jew' and put in the word 'Muslim', that is what I believe in - Bal Thackeray

>German race pride has now become the topic of the day. To keep up the purity of the race and its culture, Germany shocked the world by her purging the country of the Semitic Races - the Jews ... a good lesson for us in Hindustan for us to learn and profit by - Golwalkar

The admiration of the genocidal agenda of the Hitler is very much intact in the ideological foundation of RSS till today. 

**How is RSS relevan today**? This is the group **Narendra Modi(India's current PM) has been a member of since age 10**, rose through its ranks, and joined the political branch of the RSS: BJP, which is India's current ruling party. Today, the RSS has branches in more than 50,000 villages, runs thousands of schools, and is part of mainstream society.

**Modi writes in his biography that Hedgewar & Golwalkar were the ultimate inspiration for him after joining RSS in teenage**. Modi called Golwalkar the ""Guru worthy of worship"".

Narendra Modi is said to have turned a blind eye, if not [actively supported](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBtt6MWWsAMvdpn?format=png&name=small), the pogroms in Gujarat that killed ~2000 Muslims.

**[Narendra Modi was banned from entering the US](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-narendra-modi-was-banned-from-the-u-s-1399062010?mod=rsswn)** UK, and several European countries due to his involvement in the Gujarat 2002 riots and remained banned until his election as prime minister.

8463,"What will be some valid liberal criticisms of the right wing 'defense analyst' Abhijit Iyer Mitra?I hate this guy for a reason. Whenever I argue with bhakts, I can see through their arguments easily. Bhakts make a lot of mistakes, peddle on pseudoscience, and often live with a lot of misinformation. I am able to correct and argue against a lot of them easily. Even people like Swati Goel Sharma, who is a prominent right wing journalist, is easy to argue against. For example, she recently tweeted how 'leftist' people don't have any sympathy for persecuted Hindus from Pakistan when in reality leftists are fighting against the discriminatory nature of CAA, not CAA itself.

But this guy is...seriously beyond me. This guy abuses a lot, has terrible bigotry and have personally abused me on Twitter, but whatever he says, I have never been able to find any kind of fake news or misinformation. When that army officer said ""rape for rape"" and bhakts were celebrating that statement, he was the first to criticize that guy and call him a mental patient. He is himself gay, so we cannot label him as being anti-LGBT. He is anti-Muslim, yes, but I have never seen him spread any misinformation or fake news against them like, say, Opindia does. He is selective in his bias, yes, but have never seen him tweeting or endorsing fake news. He eats beef so he isn't surely a 'bhakt'. He has criticized and made fun of Modi. So again, not a bhakt. He is also a writer at The Print, which isn't a right wing news site. He seems to be a 'liberal' in some senses.

But still, what he does doesn't seem right. No human is without flaws and he surely isn't flawless. So, I was looking for some valid criticisms of this guy, like some mistakes or flaws in his work as a defense analyst which I can use against bhakts when arguing online. They often quote Abhijit to show that they are 'intellectuals'.",1578817171.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,14,10

8584,"[HELP] My friend, a tenant in Mumbai, received a notice from the bank stating that the owner is a defaulter and the loan hasn't been paid. When she confronted him about this, he kicked her out and claims 50% of the deposit amount.This all started in August 2019. There weren't any issues in the beginning as such. The owner had always been a nice person. My friend is a freelance web developer so she even made a website for him (the one mistake she did here was not making a work agreement).

When the project was in its final days, she was visited at home by a few bank employees. They told her that the owner has defaulted and they're about to take over the possession.

She then confronted the owner about the same, he got pissed and sent her a notice to vacate immediately. On top of this, he cancelled the website project and deducted 2 times the amount of the project (for supposedly damaging his buisness because of delays) from the deposit and the rent for an entire month when she wasn't staying.

She doesn't want any amount for the web development project, but the deposit amount that has been unfairly claimed. There's no reasoning for deducting the amount for an unrelated project from the deposit.

She hasn't returned the keys or signed any exit agreements yet. Are there any legal options to be pursued?",1578838057.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,44

8651,"Looking for honest opinions about travel destinationsI will be traveling to Chennai for business (from Canada) next month.  I will have a 2-3 days to travel on my own for sight seeing.  It's my first time being to India and would love some advice.  :)

The invidivual requesting that I come has suggested either going to the Taj Mahal, or GOA.  But with 2-3 days to play with, that seems like it would be rushed.  The Taj would take a full day to travel to, and I fear it will be a lot of standing in lines.  I'm not really sure what to expect in GOA, but it's not much closer.

For someone who will be in Chennai, and has 2-3 days to see something great (willing to travel if it's worth it), what would you suggest?  Marina beach?  Temples within Chennai?

where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection.

Where the clear stream of reason has not lost it's way

into the dreary desert sand of dead habit.

Where the mind is led forward by thee into ever widening thought and action.

8686,"Advice NeededHi Everyone! Idk if this is allowed but i am really scared and need some advice. 

I am a 22 yo Music Producer (3 years exp) from a small town. I discovered music during college and from then i just did enough to pass and get a degree. I am a B.tech (CSE) fresher with ZERO interest in it. 

3 months ago, I moved to PUNE , due to its growing music scene. To make ends meet, i took a job in an international BPO(I am fairly good with english). 

Now, the problem is
1. I am not able to make music due to long shifts (12 hrs including commute)
2. My sleep cycle is ruined and its affecting my health. 
3. I dont necessarily get sat-sun off when most of the shows happen. 
4. The job just pays enough for rent and food(i live in a pg with roommates). 
5. I can't go back home because i'm not a quitter and i want to make this music thing work. 
6. I dont wanna go into IT due to lack of tech knowledge & strong disinterest in it. 

I think i would be really good in a creative field like content creation, social media etc. But they require experience which i do not have, i would be ready to work for pennies in this field just to gain some experience because it also applies to my music career. 

I dont know what to do. Everything seems to be going downhill and i am not sure how long i can keep this up. I would really appreciate some help.",1578799028.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,5

- Reading history
- Asking questions 
- Engaging on all sides

I see each one of us turn into a lawyer for their cause and the country into a courtroom. 

It's the trial for our future. 

But I am also scared. I fear that we'll win, get everything we asked for, and then forget the utter despair and hopelessness that brought us into the struggle. 

What if we fail to pass on what we learnt to the future generations, and 50 years later they find themselves exactly where we are?

""The British have left! It's a free country for free people.""

""We've been through the Emergency. Now we'll never curb anyone's right to protest.""

""A corrupt government will pay the price for looting the country.""

We forgot every lesson. 

Time rolled its dice. And history kept dancing its ugly dance before us. 

We kicked and screamed. But kept watching. 

Is it all for nothing then? 

Endless protesting. Sloganeering. Social justice crusading. 

All just day-time fantasies for bleeding hearts?

And then I remember how, in the past month, I have recconnected with dozens of old and new friends. I have physically picked up the phone to ask about whether they are safe or not. I have stepped out into my beautiful city once again and reclaimed the public spaces that I had forgotten are mine. 

I see activists, lawyers, students, homemakers and so many others united under the tricolor. A vertible Dumbledore's Army, indeed :)

The mass displays of solidarity have rung in a sense of community in my life once again. 

The ground under me is quaking with change, and I don't feel alone anymore. 

Sure, times are dark and on some days I feel like it's all for nothing. But I find light in the eyes of every person who's found their purpose.

We have been arguing with them from a secular country perspective, where economy is an important factor to a country, but they don't think that way.

&#x200B;

Another thing we are doing wrong is forgetting the fact that Hindu religion preaches goodness too. We shouldn't even call them bhakts. It's like calling a terrorist a jihadist.

But if they follow the values of the religion, they won't be supporting BJP's oppression in the first place.

8760,"The rise of emblematic political figuresJust an opinion (probably idealistic):
I was watching a news report on Australia's bushfires the other day and witnessed the PM of Australia visiting an affected place and people there were ignoring his handshakes and were firmly asking him to release more funds to their place and by the time he was leaving, people were fuming and words like 'idiot' & 'f**ktwit' started flying around and he left. This is just an instance from another democratic nation for the analogy.Let's come back to India.Not saying in any way that we should be shooting swear words at the prime minister of the nation when he fails but being stifled to even raise a voice of dissent is not a characteristic of a healthy society. Modi has created this brand inside people's minds that he is some sort of occult infallible problem solver even when at times solutions are not asked for and are generally not the solutions for the realistic problems that persist.For he is not treated as a human being anymore,He has shaped into an emblem. An emblem of Hindutva. An emblem that is too venerated to be mocked or to take dissent. You disagree with them,You are an anti-national termite who should be sent to an adversary country. Supporting cow vigilantes behind the screen while displaying that symbolic solemn image to the public. Last time people revered a political leader and blindly followed him,a catastrophic world war happened. I am not the quintessential liberal/left winger of any sort but someone who just tries to observe and delve into minds to discern ideologies. And the opposition parties which have let BJP monopolize the nationalist narrative and keep trying to appease the minorities look so dumb. Don't stand just for minorities. Don't stand just for Hindus. Stop playing victim cards and Stand for EVERYONE and this beautiful unique NATION!",1578803024.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,14

This list can be improved, by expanding each point a little, by adding links, by adding new points and by grouping some of the points together or listing them in order of chronology. On each of the following points we can make memes/detailed explanations and distribute on social media.

1. 2002 Riots complicity. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIJXTdxg60](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkIJXTdxg60)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z114wnwXtQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z114wnwXtQ) [https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile](https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/emperor-uncrowned-narendra-modi-profile) [https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/zakia-jafri-gulburg-society-massacre-modi-2002](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/zakia-jafri-gulburg-society-massacre-modi-2002)
2. [Haren Pandya murder](https://caravanmagazine.in/politics/haren-pandya-narendra-modi-murder-case-supreme-court) Haren Pandya was a popular leader of BJP in Gujarat and a potential rival of Modi. He was assassinated while he was on a morning walk. His security was mysteriously withdrawn by the Gujarat government headed by Modi just days before his murder.  [https://thewire.in/rights/mystery-over-haren-pandya-killing-deepens-after-witness-says-top-gujarat-cop-gave-order](https://thewire.in/rights/mystery-over-haren-pandya-killing-deepens-after-witness-says-top-gujarat-cop-gave-order)
3. Fake Encounters in Gujarat [https://thewire.in/rights/mystery-over-haren-pandya-killing-deepens-after-witness-says-top-gujarat-cop-gave-order](https://thewire.in/rights/mystery-over-haren-pandya-killing-deepens-after-witness-says-top-gujarat-cop-gave-order) [https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sohrabuddin-encounter-case-timeline-1414376-2018-12-21](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sohrabuddin-encounter-case-timeline-1414376-2018-12-21) [https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-hs-bedi-panel-finds-3-out-of-17-gujarat-encounters-fake-recommends-action-against-9-cops-1976615](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/justice-hs-bedi-panel-finds-3-out-of-17-gujarat-encounters-fake-recommends-action-against-9-cops-1976615) [https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-orders-probe-of-fake-encounter-in-gujarat-568461](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/supreme-court-orders-probe-of-fake-encounter-in-gujarat-568461) 
4. Sanjiv Bhatt is in jail. If an IAS officer is in jail in India, most likely he would be very honest. [https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html](https://www.firstpost.com/india/ips-officer-sanjiv-bhatt-sacked-shame-then-frame-trend-part-of-vendetta-politics-of-gujarat-2400796.html) The case of Sanjiv Bhatt is a prime example of the vindictive politics of Modi. Sanjiv Bhatt may or may not be innocent, but it is clear that  Modi can stoop to any level to ruthlessly destroy his opponents. Sanjiv Bhatt was sentenced for life in a 30 years old case.  To put this in perspective 180 custodial deaths happened in Gujarat in 16 years, not  a single cop was punished Read more at: [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/180-custodial-deaths-in-gujarat-in-16-years-no-cop-punished/articleshow/69881991.cms)
5. In 2005, Sanjay Joshi, Sangh's blue-eyed boy and Modi's rival, figured in a controversial CD. He was immediately removed from all posts in the BJP. The video was later revealed to be doctored; a police officer later testified that the CD was given to him by controversial police officer DG Vanzhara. But, by then, Joshi had fallen from his perch.

>Conversion To Christianity

>Conversion To Hinduism

>In order to practice and convert to Hinduism, there is no official conversion process or religious ceremony. One needs only to have the will and the commitment to study the scriptures and abide the proper practices as provided in the Religion. In India, you can visit a nearby Arya Samaj temple and show your willingness towards conversion to Hinduism post which they will issue you a certificate of conversion

8849,"[AskIndia] Hey /r/india Please help me with ideas for donating money. (Also CMV if my approach/thinking is wrong.)Hi!

Over the last few years, I have been earning a lot more money than before and I want to use some of it to help others who aren't as fortunate.

Currently I am sponsoring the education for 2 siblings with a single mother and few other small donations which I don't even need twice to say yes to. 

Most appeals for financial help that I come across on social media are well within my means to help, but I'm not sure if that's the best way to spend my money. 

This post  is mostly to help me decide what kind of efforts I should be funding. So I can set aside funds for such causes and whenever I come across an appeal, I shouldn't have to think about whether I should donate or how much etc. 

I would like to donate to things that can significantly change people's lives for the better. (Beyond just helping them survive/maintain status quo.)

Things I don't feel comfortable sponsoring, 
 - Expensive school education(pre-classX) for under privileged kids. (Expensive = 20-30k per annum, I don't mind funding someone's college education for a lot moret, but I feel  it's super expensive for school fees.) 
 - Expensive medical treatment for strangers with low chances of survival. (I'm conflicted on this, but my thinking the same amount of money can help a lot more people instead of feeding into medical industry profits. I may think differently if it was a family member or close friend.)

Looking to hear your views on how/what causes to donate to. Or share your thinking around this issue..

Or if you know any low profile people/organisations doing good work, please share information here.

8877,"This is something that I feel must not be forgotten in the times that we face right now. A little write up inspired from the protest and everthing that we call secular.# SECULARITY OF EXISTENCE

We wish we were secular. In our thoughts, in our presentation, in our dialogue, and in our relations.

The reality of the fact is that we are not. Now I know that we know this. But I extend this umbrella even over the people who are shouting slogans of a secular state. Do not get me wrong, I am not saying that the protesters are only pretending or being hypocritical. What I am trying to get at is that we all have tendencies with which we have evolved over the time of 250’000 years of human existence.

The kind of existence where we lived in small communities, hunted game, collected roots, and made tools. We never existed in the large groups that we encounter today, never did we live in a metropolis with a concoction of culture, race, and ethics. We have never lived this kind of existence on such a grand scale.

In all of our **recorded** history, we never had a discussion, interaction neither physical nor intellectual on a scale this large, but then again our recorded history is only of 15’000 years. So, to say that we have any idea of what our species must have established in the 235’000 years of unknown, unrecorded existence is a mystery so great and so deep but its shadow is still too small when held against the mystery of life itself.

Therefore our overwhelming confidence about **any** issue shows to us the ego we have attached to our existence and a that-is-that way of how we perceive all things in our life. When you weigh our decisions, actions, and our classification of “right” vs “wrong” against the very truths of our existence and mysteries of life it is so naive because our experiences are infinitesimal when compared to the plethora of things we have zero knowledge about. This is not an argument to say that the battles we have propped up for ourselves are not worth fighting for, but we need to accept the fact of the matter, that these are battles which ARE in-fact propped up by us, by the brethren of our species. The ideas upon which we humans have drawn boundaries and segregated the species are not mystical or out-worldly but very much our own doing.

And to shelter our already inflated egos, we construct narratives(religions) around it which enable us to exist as a status quo in this pseudo-hierarchical narrative. This is just a play, to keep us from the truth because the truth is hard to swallow. The truth that we are all going to die on the same soil where we were brought into existence, that too without our choice of time and circumstance is something which should provide us the force to lead our lives with fearlessness and a spirit so free that we embrace each and every fleeting moment of our existence on this rock and fill it with love and joy towards our own self and towards everything that we share our existence with.

**But instead, we fight and quarrel over land, religion, ideas and other very worldly and material things when it is the force of life which enables our existence, which gives us consciousness, the value of which is so immaterial and its origin is well beyond our bounds of understanding. This is an irony so profound that it is funny.**

Some people realize this and try to go on the path of preaching the truth to the masses, and to the people who are under the illusion that our lives are hierarchical.

But these people have an ego just as inflated as the ones they are fighting against, so then what do we even say the difference between the two is?  There isn’t. This needs to be identified and accepted. The day when the people who say they are “right or correct” start differentiating between 'us' and 'them' a new hierarchy is established.

**Now, one thing that I am sure of, is that we do not need hierarchy to fight hierarchy.**

One is not better than the other in any way shape or form, and that is the truth. We need to fight for the un-segregation of ‘us’ and ‘them’. **This is the true secular idea.** You are not better than any other human in existence, when you put it that way it must hurt, but exactly what does it hurt? It hurts our ego, and there is no ‘good’ ego and ‘bad’ ego there is just ego.

So how could we even possibly tackle this issue? What I am basically asking for here, is to shake hands with the “enemy”. This is a hard pill to swallow because to get yourself to communicate in a friendly, caring, loving and respectful way to the person who is oblivious to the idea that we are **one** and to not be disheartened if the person in front of you does not accept what you are trying to explain, and to have the perseverance to do it all over again without caring for the outcome. (there is not a single human in existence who can be oblivious to the idea that we are on a planet, floating nowhere, we are all going to die, and we do not know what exists after that).

**And in no way is it an easy task, but our minds should be kept in check at all times and we cannot let our egos run wild just because you are ‘correct’.**

**Any type of extremity needs to be avoided at all costs because at the final stage of all extremities there lies a different kind of dystopia waiting for us.**",1578727582.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,6

""Do you believe in hindu rashtra, which is against the constitution"", 90% of time they will skip it. Only a  few little of them accept that its not hindu rastra, if they accept it is not a hindu rastra, you can continue you argument coz he is a sane person.

But if he dont deny the Hindu Rashtra ideology and keep bugging you, tell them that's its them who are anti-constitutional and how could they ask question to you, if they dont believe in constitution of India.
