I have created a Google Forms survey based on the Perceived Stress Scale (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceived_Stress_Scale?wprov=sfla1), which is a widely used metric to asses the how stressed individuals are. Studies have shown it to be a reliable measure of stress and it also predicts depression, smoking use and objective biological markers of stress (among other things).

I've tried finding PSS surveys on Indians but have only come up with academic surveys in some colleges which showed that students studying in medical and other colleges have higher stress levels.

 I know this subreddit is definitely not a good sample for India as a whole. Also, it is true that to translate the test into other languages one needs to be careful since the way the questions are worded impacts how people respond.   Nonetheless I would be very thankful if you all take some time out of your schedule and fill out the anonymous Google form below. Your identity and email will remain anonymous though you have to use a Google account (to limit multiple submissions by the same account) to fill it. 


It will atleast give us enough data to find how r/India compares with the mean stress levels in countries like USA. Mental health in India is very low on anyone's priorities and to help change the situation we need data first more than anything. I will post the results of the survey in the coming weeks, along with any interesting finds I get after doing a statistical analysis. Please feel free to pm me if you need any more information on the methodology.

Thanks!

Job roles that I am looking for, Assistant director, or cameraman or cinematographer. Anything that lets me work on the set and helps me understand how things happen. An internship will also be fine. Ready to work for a vada pav.

I feel the movie plot is relevant in today's times, not only in the US but also in India. Democracy is failing. Collective conscientiousness is lacking in the society. The selfishness is taking over humanity. Logic is being replaced with faith. Information is being replaced with biased news-feeds. To reverse the process of going downhill, all we need is big revolution in the society.

Lastly, the quote from the movie: ""**Is it just me or is it getting crazier out there?**""

I am a young white English woman soon to be travelling alone in India for 5 months (Oct-Mar). One aspect I am worried about is harassment/eve teasing. I know there are a lot of things you can do to reduce it, for example wearing modest clothes, covering your hair, using the ladies compartment in trains, sitting next to other women on busses etc.

One other thing friends have told me about, which is more extreme, is pretending to be married- ie wearing wedding ring, matching toe rings, vermillion in the parting, mangalsutra necklace. 

I can see that this will probably help a lot but I feel like it is quite deceptive, I do have a boyfriend so it isn't a complete lie but I don't know if this would be seen as very disrespectful if someone did find out that I am not married?

So what I would like to know is what are your opinions on this, is it necessary to go this far? Is it disrespectful? Do you have any tips for avoiding harassment?

Thank you!",1569866922.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,49,27

492,"Talking about the effects of the climate crisisI know that many of you feel concerned about climate change, but let's talk a bit about our personal experiences with the mismanagement of the environment in India, and what it has led to. I'd share a few things observed in the last 20 years that I have a living memory of. 

1. Water levels: In a city in Gujarat, where I grew up, it isn't uncommon these days to see people dig a borewell to depths of 1000 feet. When I was growing up, it used to be around 5-600 feet. In 20 years, things have worsened by 100%.
2. Rivers: We used to go to picnics in many rural areas, and the highlight used to be the chance to play in the streams. I recently saw the pic of one of those spots- while more tourist infrastructure has been developed, the river is mostly dry these days. Most farmers switched to groundwater. And streams drying means that the main river will not get the water and suffer eventually. 
3. Forests: Except a few parts in eastern and southern India, the devastation of our forests is for all to see. Many hills around the popular hill stations in north India are completely barren. In Rajasthan, you can literally see the hills go missing within a few years as they're blasted off for granite.
4. Climate: Remember how predictable monsoons were in the '90s? Yes, there were droughts and floods, but you'd be surprised if you got heavy rain in December or a heatwave in March. We see this happening now. 

The problem is too complex for a Reddit thread, but it'd be great to learn about the other locally visible effects of the environmental degradation that we've accelerated.",1569900465.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,10,39

497,"Bard of Blood - Review (Disappointed!)Okay so i had read two posts here which were polar opposite in terms of they felt the series is to them.
Well i saw the whole series yesterday and i was so disappointed.
The dialogues, action, story, cast and the intelligence put into a spy series is so so bad.

Spoilers ahead!
The deputy head of the indian spy agency -“ he is a son like to me, but now we dont talk. Bad blood!” So cringey.

The hero and his friend have botched a mission, his friends foot is on a wire which will trigger an explosive. Can u not leave his gun on that wire or something equally heavy and just get off. It was such an illogical scene.

Mr.Hashmi looks so unfit for a spy, his running is comical. Maybe I shouldn’t judge but you expect a spy to take off when he runs. His actions scenes are just bland. There is a scene where they run from the lodge and his aides pick him up. He runs around the car in almost a circle (so slowly) to get in while the cops are shooting away from a few metres away. 🙄

Another scene, his aide says this road no checkpost. Lets go. But checkpost! They want money. Just give the damn money. No some useless quarrel and fight. Now the three indians are behind the car and full on gun firing from just a little distance away and the indians somehow con the military and hide away from the car to the truck within their view! How is that possible?!

The cast is so bad acting! His aide RBL, the supposedly geek guy at indian HQ. The terrorist, their native language felt so robotic.

Spoilers end!

I could go on but this is not some intentional effort to make an indian series seem bad. But its just disappointing and the makers should understand this is not a decade back where the indian audience would clap away at just seeing a bike with a button zoom away. Now the audience wants some logic and emotion to the scene.

Since my wife is also from India and wants to be closer to home, we are considering the idea of moving to India with my parents. We don't have to move to the same city but would like to be close.

We are looking for a city that would be nice for a younger couple (maybe with children in the future), that is relatively safe, and that is in Gujarat (or anywhere within 7 hours, with good transportation to Rajkot).

875,"Aryan Invasion Theory, Romila Thapar, NCERT Text BooksIt is an often quoted idea that Indian school text books have taught and have been teaching Aryan Invasion Theory. 


And Indian historians of marxist school of thought have propagated this Idea. 
And the biggest culprit of this is said to be Romila Thapar. 

However on trying to check for it.. I couldn't find any source at all. 

In Fact, I couldn't find any modern Indian historian ever supporting a Aryan Invasion. 

Romila Thapar in her 1966 book 
A history of India - Volume - I 
Critically talks about Aryan Invasion and States that there is no evidence for it. 

Also on the word Aryan she says that it was a linguistic term and was never a term used to denote race. 

(A position which she has updated in her recent book - she now states that the word meant different things at different times - a linguistic term as well as a term to describe nobleness.) 


On the question of history textbooks.. I couldn't find any NCERT text books propagating this Idea of an Invasion. Even old ones.
In fact the ones from the last twenty years especially point it out that Invasion was suggested but no evidence. 


Why is this myth still propagating and why do people claim this? 



It is to be noted that Romila Thapar holds that a migration did take place of ""Aryans"". So she is supporter of Aryan Migration Theory. 
History text books also talk about Aryan Migration.

However the New NCERTs brought in after 2006 don't talk about the Migration even. They have nothing on this topic. They have not even used the word ""Aryan"" anywhere.",1569840212.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,31,24

A recent speech in UNGA was one such example i watched the whole event live but the hypocrisy , lies and threats those were peddled in those 50 min of one speech was complete BS.

Talk about bias, discrimination against religious minority in Pakistan is incorporated in the constitution, article 41 clause 2 of Pak const says that only a Muslim can become a president, article 2 clearly states that Islam is state religion and democracy can exist only as per principles of Islam. The persecution & conversion of minorities christian,hindu,sikh is so rapid that every year 1000 girls from minority are converted  [https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/](https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2014/04/08/1000-christian-hindu-girls-forced-to-convert-to-islam-report/)  . The blasphemy laws in penal code are a story in itself many international groups have pointed these things out [https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf](https://eptoday.com/files/Religious%20Minorities%20Report.pdf) .

Please don't forget  in 1940s it was the  rejection of secularism by Muslim League and demand of a religion based state that was directly responsible for murder of a million, rapes of lakhs of women and displacement of 10s of millions. If you believe Muslim league was sole voice of Muslims you are wrong, even Muslim scholars raised objection to partition and a work of Deobandi scholar Hussain Ahmed Madani  [*Muttahida Qaumiyat Aur Islam*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muttahida_Qaumiyat_Aur_Islam)  was an effort in this direction only.  

Leave secularism as it was never to be expected from Pak but even the claim to be champion of Muslim as per UNGA speech fall flat. Ahmadis are officially declared as Non-Muslims as per second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second\_Amendment\_to\_the\_Constitution\_of\_Pakistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Amendment_to_the_Constitution_of_Pakistan) . In 1971 fellow Muslim and Pakistani Mujibur Rehman was rejected the rightful Govt & PM ship by the army & west Pakistan leadership just coz he was from Bengal and it again led to killing of millions and violation of lakhs of women in Bangladesh, sheikh Hasina again pointed out that in her UNGA address too [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnqnwjr7JeQ&t=925s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnqnwjr7JeQ&t=925s) because world seem to forget it conveniently. 

Talk about global conflict, the country was the one causing nuclear proliferation as an active state policy by zia in 80s in order to create nuclear opacity & escape scrutiny and sold nuclear tech to Iran,Libya and even North Korea. Very smartly the govt & militarily has made A Q khan as scapegoat of same [http://world.time.com/2011/07/07/a-q-khans-revelations-did-pakistans-army-sell-nukes-to-north-korea/](http://world.time.com/2011/07/07/a-q-khans-revelations-did-pakistans-army-sell-nukes-to-north-korea/). The role in creation of Mujaheddin and terrorist by Pakistan army & govt. was accepted earlier also and it is no secret that particular group was the one have been active in export of terror to not only Afghanistan but later on in Kashmir too. It was later accepted by Musharraf also that these mujaheddin were actively used by Pak army to be pushed into Kashmir. 

Come to the present Govt of PTI , it was PTI and IK who actively barred Asia bibi in blasphemy case to leave the country and instead released the  Tehreek-e-Labbaik protesters.  [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/02/christian-woman-cleared-blasphemy-barred-leaving-pakistan/](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/11/02/christian-woman-cleared-blasphemy-barred-leaving-pakistan/) . Not only that the media censorship in Pak is also at a very alarming level. See i don't believe in enemy concept and treating a particular nation as eternal enemy would be fallacy & unethical, the pain in IK voice when he mentioned ""India tried to Balcklist us"" was so obvious and i think India must have really gotten into teeth of him and shouldn't have done so considering the tough state of economics in Pak. But do India have any reason to not trust the evidence and past history, even in UNGA speech veiled threats of religious war was made by repeatedly calling to  Muslims of the world only without using the word ""Jihad"" which he is saying now as soon as he lands in his country  [https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/it-is-a-jihad-says-imran-on-kashmir-after-returning-from-us/articleshow/71362975.cms](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/it-is-a-jihad-says-imran-on-kashmir-after-returning-from-us/articleshow/71362975.cms) . This hijacking in name of religion has been going there since the inception of idea of Pakistan, Muslim league used effectively ""Islam in Danger"" in the 1940s to gather votes and break the intercommunal tribal loyalties of punjabi Jats & gujjars.  They used it again in order to bring terrorists from all over the world in afghan border , created taliban and now blame west & afghans for the same. Same language was used in UNGA too.

I graduated with Btech in mechanical and doing a sales job (on the calls) since then. Been 3 years I have been doing this, The pay isnt great but it helps me save a bit and pays all of my bills.

I am done calling. I can't call anymore. The place where I work is not going to make me a manager (the only way to get away from calls) and I have reached the saturation point, so I have put down my papers and 4th Oct is my last day. I don't have any job in hand. And I want to land a job which is not related to calling or even sales anymore. Going back to that domain in engineering isn't an option either. I just don't like it. 

I would love to get into the finance domain with something as simple as fund house/AMC or stockbroker. Willing to work for a lower pay too as long as there's something to learn there. But here the question arises ""What skills do I have to be recruited?"" The only answer I have is I love money. I understand how and when and where to invest. Maybe on the intermediate level.

To explore my interests, I gave an Excel Cours basics from Udemy a try and loved it. Tried some of the lessons on my own data of lifts of volume/reps/sets I do in the gym and it was as good as the app that tracks it. 

BUT will anyone hire me? How do I go ahead with the new interest of mine and make a career out of it? This was the first time in a decade that I sat down to learn something on my own. No pressure of exam or parents. 

How do I get into a job that gets me in these? I am okay with an entry-level pay on these too.

The gift can be chosen from many of the available items like laptop, refrigerator, phone, camera, TV etc. Initially I thought something was fishy but I decided to play along. After I added the items to my cart and chose the gift, he asked me to pay the amount via netbanking, upi, or Paytm. He asked me not to click on proceed to buy but instead pay via these specific methods so as to generate some transaction id which they can verify. 

By this time I knew it was a scam. So I told him I'll pay by Google pay. He gave his number and surprisingly enough it showed up as Amazon.in .
I cut the call after giving him a piece of my mind.

932,"Got My First Show-Cause Notice for Sex Toy in IndiaHey, so I actually ordered an adult toy online (it's an onahole/japanese anime male masturbator, the fellatio one with realistic mouth detailing) from Amazon US and received a show-cause notice from Customs in my city (Tamil Nadu).

I honestly didn't know sex toys were considered illegal to be imported in India, so yeah.

I've sent an email (the one mentioned in the show cause notice) to them twice explaining that it was an honest mistake and that I was unaware of the laws behind this, that I didn't know importing was illegal. Also attached screenshots showing that I sent a message to the seller requesting to take back the order or cancel/return it.

Am I okay?

The Notice:

[https://pasteboard.co/IzOZSJ2.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/IzOZSJ2.jpg)

[https://pasteboard.co/IzP0ENE.jpg](https://pasteboard.co/IzP0ENE.jpg)

Received their notice on the 28th in my mail even though it's dated 25th. Sent them an email on Saturday and today morning too but they haven't responded yet. This is the email I sent them:

Dear City Airport Customs Department,

It has been brought to my attention that my Amazon order Tracking No XXX

(Amazon Order ID: XXX)

was prohibited from being imported in customs airport due to its nature of being an adult toy. The order value was $57.17 (Rs 4,336.55)

I received a letter from your department asking for my reasons for importing it and why I shouldn't be penalized, so here I go.

My reasons:

1. It was my first time ordering an adult toy online and as such, I was not aware of the laws and that they were not allowed to be imported. If I knew, I wouldn't have ordered online. Sorry. It was an honest error from my side.
2. Reason why I bought it - I live alone and I bought it for personal use. I work from home and don't get time to socialize. I did not buy it for trade or commercial reasons (only personal/solo/private use)
3. Regarding if I could be heard in person, I can't appear in person at the moment (I don't have money to travel around for now) so I can only respond to you via video call, phone, or email for a confirmation.

If you need any ID or address proof for further confirmation, please let me know and I'll attach and send it over via email.

In the meantime, if you can't allow importing Tracking No XXX, can you please send it back to the seller's address?

I can get a refund from Amazon US website that way.

Regarding refund for tracking number XXX for which I received a Show Cause Notice from your department to my postal address, I've emailed the seller to take it back on Saturday EOD and am waiting for their reply on Amazon.

You are free to confiscate and destroy the item or return it.

Please just update me or reply to my email about the status of the shipment and I'll notify the seller again. 

Secondly, I actually ordered a total of two items from Amazon US so the other one, I just asked to be cancelled online after receiving the letter. 

The order number for that was YYY and I asked the seller to track the shipment and take it back instead of sending it (expected arrival was dated Oct 3 to Oct 31st for that one)

Order value for that was 1602 Rs

I have received a reply from the seller regarding cancellation and they agreed to take it back and said they'll get it returned in 7-14 days, so it probably won't arrive in the country for importing. 

Attaching screenshots of the email below for cancellation of order ID XXX and order ID YYY for your reference.

I'm sorry for the inconvenience and ignorance. I'll take note from next time and won't repeat the same mistake.

You can also text me on Whatsapp on my personal number ZZZ or call me for any further questions/clarifications.

Thank you for hearing me out and please reply to my email. Waiting to hear back from you.

948,"A different take on India's employment crisis.Hi everyone, 

I have been reading a lot about the unemployment crisis in India. Yes, it is a serious situation. But so far, most of the so-called experts have taken the opportunity to blame the youth, the global economy, and the ""failed"" education system. 

As someone who has closely worked with graduates from the best universities in the world, and has been residing in the first world since the last 6 years, I'd like to share a different perspective. The intention here is not to waste your time with a rant, but to seek your opinion, and possibly, to influence it. 

Personal background: Tier-1 Engg graduate from India pursuing Ph.D. abroad. Worked at a bluechip for a few years before Ph.D. Yes, I'm old.

Here's my take on the situation. 

1. ""Not enough quality applicants"". **This is absolute bullshit.** Irrespective of what roles you're hiring for, there are at least 500 people against a position in India and at least 100 of them will ace every technical test you put them through. At least 50 will pass through the other rounds. Who do you hire if you need just 1 person? Here's where nepotism comes into play. It is almost impossible to get through to a recruiter without a referral. I've had to struggle a lot even with a referral (that's a story for another post). 

It is not that there aren't enough qualified people. **Just that the people are not well known to the insiders, and employers create this perception that you're not good enough.** I've been guilty of the same when interviewing others, but am facing the crisis now as I look for jobs. 

2. ""No skills only paper degrees"". I am finishing a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in a Top 20 global univ with a scholarship, have published, have coded,  designed experiments and managed budgets of $1M as a graduate student. Yet, this is what I heard from a recruiter. **I was amused because the company HR lead at (a technology company) was actually a graduate of IIPM** (yes, the infamous IIPM)**.** We're in a market where recruiters and the HR team is increasingly distanced from what education has to offer. **Sure, I can do a few certificates in applied ML techniques, but no way is an online module a substitute for a good education.** Yes, it can be for jobs that just involve a single skill, but not for any other more significant role. 

Sadly, most jobs in India these days are of this kind- c**atering to a niche skillset, and mostly because we just have 1 developed industry- that's the technology sector.** And most companies except the startups are outsourcing powerhouses- your clients need robots not humans, so that's what is in demand. 

3. ""Need to have real-life skills not bookish knowledge"". This one is my favorite. I've heard this so often. I remember when I joined as an intern in a blue-chip company, they actually wanted a fresh perspective, and my project saved them a few crores in a year. We learn in school, we practice at work. **That's how it works everywhere in the world, except in India. Recruiters are so proud to diss the efforts of good students by pointing out their lack of experience- that's what internships are for. It is a tragedy that most internships are perceived in India as a cheap substitute for an employee or an easy way to get free work. If this continues, how will the next-gen develop real skills?** 

4. ""Engineers in India are unemployable."" I agree partially on this one. Some engineers are indeed not employable. The tragedy is that the reports that talk about employability only consider software development as a skill. **You may be a mech engg with the ability to design well on Solidworks, but if you can't write code, you're counted amongst the unemployable.** I find myself squirming upon seeing such reports, and people gleefully celebrating the same and blaming everyone else. Please understand that no country has such a skewed opportunity bias against other engineering fields. In China, you're equally likely to gain a good job as a civil engineer. Sadly, as pointed out earlier, our industrial base is missing. PSUs were a mediocre savior, but now they're being killed off as well. 

5. ""no innovation in India and Indian scientists are wasting our taxpayers money""

Here's what I've heard from many about their perspective on R&D jobs in India. Yes, I'm aware that many of you think that Indian scientists are useless. **You would be surprised to know that in terms of research output per $ invested, we're amongst the top. It costs $1.5 M to publish a paper in Nature or Science here and our scientists do experiments with much fewer resources. And no, a Nobel prize is not a factor that helps you build a technology base- it just gives bragging rights but doesn't affect scientific productivity.**

Sadly, the smart folks who write derisive comments about Indian scientists have never done the research themselves and have no idea of what they're complaining about. **You'll find thousands of productively usable technologies developed in Indian labs.** But again, there is a genuine disconnect between the industry and academia. Why? **Think of how many high-end manufacturers are there here?** Why will they license anything if they don't make it here anyway? And even for the top scientific organizations, the vision and strategy is limited by the IAS babus at the top. **Nowhere in the world will you find an administrator with 0 scientific credibilities driving the strategy of a research institute.** **There's 0 govt. intervention in creating jobs in renewables, advanced manufacturing and R&D. In the 60s and 70s, the Govt built DRDO, BARC and several other research centers that led us to be technology independent in many sectors- since the 90s, nothing has been done on increasing public R&D investment.** 

\*\*\* 

Sorry if this reads like a rant- it isn't meant to be. 

I have realized that India is a classic example of what happens to an economy when you just focus on one sector and have nothing else. Except for technology and outsourcing companies, we are in no comparison to other economies of a similar per capita income in any field, and the results are here to see.

**There is a genuine shortage of jobs in India. No amount of bullshitting about lack of skills and global slowdown etc is going to mask that.** Vietnam and Thailand have enough jobs, and most of them pay a much better entry-level wage than India. Why? Because they focused on investing in manufacturing and exports. 

In a way, I'm quite hopeless these days about our future. **No one is thinking about the youth and their future, especially 20 years later when they retire. An entire generation of the young and unemployed is getting wasted doing work that will soon be automated (call centers, delivery etc).**

What will I do? For now, try scoring a job. It is not easy because most companies don't care about your capabilities. For me, my Tier 1 degree allows a better network, but I don't see any jobs that require a Ph.D. or any advanced education in India. I'll have to be content with my life here and hope to land post-doc jobs somewhere else down the line. I**n a way, I regret doing a PhD instead of going the usual IIM/ISB/USA ka MBA because those guys are earning more than 4 times my income, and basically working on powerpoint and excel. I used to have a job like that. But curiosity killed the cat.** 

If you are amongst the educated unemployed and people keep telling you that you're not good enough, smart enough, skilled enough, don't take it too seriously. India is the worst job market in the middle-income group of countries at the moment.

956,"We Indians are skeptic about giving money to poor. So why don't we give them food and water?I stopped giving money to beggers the day I realized that some of them choose to beg because it lets them earn more money than doing some job. I also stopped because I heard stories of kids giving that money to some alcoholic man or some mafia.

But then I saw a video on Youtube of a white guy from developed country who plays with poor kids and gives them food and water, considering everyone finds a place to sleep...its the food and water that they need to survive.

I felt so stupid that I never thought of this idea.

Do Indians know about this idea or they believe in the theory that if we give free food and water to the poor, they will never do any jobs for the society?

I believe that if we want to make them do jobs, its the governmental care and supervision that they need. Not giving them food and water will only cause their personal suffering, and worse than that... Crime.",1569801734.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,0

This setup worked well but right now with volume of work increasing I cannot rely on remote workers and need them to be in same office. The designers I have are good but due to them not being in the same location I am not able to communicate well which has led to a drop in quality of work.

With all of this happening I want to open up a small office and hire 3 designers locally. The hiring part is easy as we have an local online design community and I can hire using that. What I am worried about is the setting up of a business part. I know nothing about it and need help.

Some questions I have are,

* Do I need a trade license to open an office?
* Do I register as a sole proprietorship or LLP or Pvt Ltd?
* Do I register for GST or will hand bills work?
* How do I provide invoice?
* Can I pay the designers in cash?
* Do I need to pay tax on the salaries paid to my employees?

I know these are too many questions but I really appreciate any help.

1069,"A Dialogue on Patriotism.I wrote a dialogue today. Give me feedback.

&#x200B;

One evening, I and my chaps were discussing a matter related to the country's Politics. 

A self-proclaimed patriot said, ""If one wants to live in this country, he should be a patriot. 

And another asked the first, ""What if he is not?"". 

The first one answered, ""He should be detained and sent to another country.""

I asked, with my congenital habit of meddling into the matter related to politics, ""what is patriotism?""

Self-Proclaimed patriot said, ""Loving once country and vigorously supporting its army.""

And then I asked, ""If supporting army can be listed as one of the attributes to identifying one's patriotism, then how will you identify a patriot in Iceland, where, there is no army.""

Then, another chap with little inquisitiveness asked, ""If you think they are not the right definitions to define one's Patriotism, then what are?""

I said, ""The first definition my chap said, is true.""

""So, you agree with me that loving the country is the definition of Patriotism.""

""Yes.""

""Okay then, Are you a Patriot?""

""Depends on the Definition.""

""Of what?""

""Of country.""

""What's so difficult to define a country?""

""Preach me with your knowledge, and help me understand.""

Looking at his phone's screen, he says, ""According to Cambridge dictionary, a country is an area of land that has its government, army.""

""Looks like there is a major flaw in Cambridge's definition.""

""What's wrong with that?""

""Something is missing in this definition of yours.""

""Why don't you stop baffling and come to the point.""

""This definition is leaving out the most important part of a country - The people. The people are the only significant part of a country.""

""Don't you think that the army does the most significant work by maintaining peace and stability.""

""Perhaps, but doesn't it maintain peace by creating havoc?""

""They do, only when it is necessary.""

""And how do they identify the necessity of the situation?""

""When justice is getting out of hand, the necessity of using arms is justified.""

""Okay, I agree with your reasoning, but tell me, what is justice?""

Again he pops out his phone from his pocket and starts blabbering about his definition and says, ""maybe, following the laws.""

"" I agree with what you have just said, but I have a different view of justice. If I follow Plato's definition of justice and as I do, A person should play a role which he ought to play, synchronously with other persons.""

""Don't start again with your perplexing theories and speak lucidly.""

""Suppose, a cricketer, when he takes retirement from cricket and joins politics without any knowledge of it. He doesn't even believe in coming to the parliament for debates. Isn't he committing social injustice?""

""Don't they have the right to join politics?""

""Of course, they have. But they shouldn't have.""

""Why?""

""For the same reasons, according to Hindu texts, a Dalit isn't permitted to read the holy scriptures.""

""So, are you justifying the caste system?""

""No. My dear chap, I am just saying that the person shouldn't be allowed to do any work without their ability.""

""Okay, leave your Philosophical talks and why can't you define Patriotism yourself.""

""As much as I know, Patriotism simply can't be defined as the loving the army and blindly singing its song of valour. But it is about loving the country.

1083,"Need Advice from Software EngineersHello everyone,

I am a college fresher, working as an application supports engineer for past 3 months in a Decent MNC . My job is half as software engineer and half technical support, switched on month basis. But, I always wanted to be software engineer Not application support engineer. I was recruited though campus placement, so seeing people around me getting placed, and pressure of having job after college I ended up in this company.

Apart from that. I am working in Bangalore. As you all know this city is among the costliest cities in India. The culture, the feel is just different. I feel very alone here, I always stay in a small closed room because there is nobody out there. But this city is know as silicon valley of India. The city is full with working professionals and there is a huge scope of career development.

Now let's talk about Gurgaon where I've few friends, good transport facility, a very convenient city . The best advantage, which I really want is my home that's just 100 kms away from this city BTW the distance from Bangalore to my city is 2000 km . I will be able to visit my home once/twice a month,chill and spend more time with my family But the problem is Gurgaon doesn't have that much scope (till now) that Bangalore has. But still there are many companies and startups, more than enough to get job. Gurgaon is on it's way be become the next IT hub in India.

I don't want to stay in my current company. Let's say I work there for 2 years(as a Depressed guy) then my experience with software development will just be 1 year. But salary in a Starup will surely be less than where I am working , but Gurgaon is cheaper than Bangalore.

**Question is**: what should I do, Should I move to Gurgaon, which I want right now and work with less salary in a startup? or stay in the current company or apply for other companies in Bangalore?",1569768395.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,3,7

1143,"Whistleblower - Exposing A MLM from Indian Premier institute graduates.Sorry, for posting this here but I had to get it off my chest. I am JU chemical engg dropout, pursuing a cse degree from a 3 tier college at the age of 25. Recently, one of my seniors from JU(2014 batch), whom I have never spoken to in my entire life approached me for a ""business proposal"". When I asked him what the business was about, he said it's an ecommerce business. I asked him if it's something like shopify. He said no and he said the details can only be explained to me in person. It sounded like a mlm/pyramid scheme/ponzi scheme to me. I have experiences of this from 2012, when I was 18, a school friend of mine was doing a similar thing. But I was smart back then and I am smart now, so I decided to play along. He invited me over to Starbucks, Park Street, yesterday. Now, I have experiences of freelancing and side hustles. So, when I met him I was giving him advice how business is not a short time thing but its a long journey and it's totally based on luck. We were supposed to meet his ""mentor"". Another friend of his, who did his BTech in mechanical and did his MBA from IIM A, was there, he was giving me advice, how to get rich in 3-4 years. I don't believe in quick money and even if you earn that sort of money in 3-4 years, your lifestyle will change according to this new found wealth and that money won't last long. This is what I was telling them. Now, mind it, these guys are  3-4 years elder to me. And I was giving them advice. I didn't even know that this guy was from IIM A. When he said that, I was shocked. I was like, I can't believe Im giving advice to people whose qualifications I can never match. Anyway, this IIM A guy leaves after 20 minutes and the mentor comes around 5 pm. He sees my marketing skills and my talent. But then he tells me about "" Rich dad poor dad"" And shows how with their MLM scheme I can earn 3-4 crores in 3-5 years. Now this mentor, is a MBA graduate from XLRI, and was a banker and what not. I couldn't believe, graduates from such premier instutions were doing this. I only have to invest 3 lacs upfront and then hire 10 people and mentor them to hire 10 more and this keeps going on. So, what's the endgame here? Either someone will run off with this money, or they have to perpetually add new members to their MLM to sustain the cashflow and marketing. They asked me if I would like to have something at Starbucks. I refused because I am an unemployed student, and I know then I would have to pay the bills. Those people spend their time in starbucks yet drink normal tap water and nothing else from there. Who are they fooling with their ""looking rich"" Lifestyle?? One thing that I have learned from the 2008 recession was most investment bankers and bankers in general are Grade A crooks. White collar criminals. I can't believe that IIM A guy spent 30 lacs on his degree to do this now. They are now harassing me over whatsapp to send me 3 lac rupees within wednesday.

 If students and alumnus from premier institutions are doing this, I wonder what the rest of the country is upto. That ""mentor"" simply asked me to switch off my brain for the next 3-5 years and do as he says, then I will become rich. They were showing me videos of events they had in Bangkok last year and they are going to conduct another one next week. I have been to Bangkok with my own hard earned money at the age of 22, so such things don't attract me. I could hardly control my laughter. I would have laughed off on their face. But I was smart, I nodded and I agreed and then ran the f*** out of that place as soon as possible. I believe talking to them is a simple waste of my time, energy and mental resources. I can't believe these people have quit their jobs and doing this fulltime for a living. I want to make people aware of such scams. Please do NOT fall into such money making traps. There is no quick money or success in life. Also, please have the integrity and character to never scam anyone in your life, no matter how hard the times get. Even if you have to beg on the streets, but don't scam others.

Any advices or suggestions are always welcome.

1302,"[P] Remember the IndianI'm seeing increasing and careless use of labels like ""liberals"", ""left-wing"", ""right-wing"", and ""conservatives"" in our political discourse. Not only are these western terms laughably inadequate in capturing the nuanced political mindset of our people, but these words are almost always used in a negative context. Which help no one but the enemies who would very much like to see us divided.

We are (un)fortunate witnesses to the chaos that is American democracy right now. If you have been observing long enough, you would remember that the political divide was always there, but it wasn't such a polarised environment it is today. The ""left"" hates the ""right"", the ""right"" hates them back equally. Everyone sees themselves as a soldier of their ""side"" and blindly follows the thoughts of their echo chamber without thinking about them individually. Rabid followers, left or right, are constantly attacking half the people of their own country, instead of attacking ideas. Foreign actors are likely fuelling the hatred on both sides.

Let's not delve ourselves into ultra-polarized landscape the US finds itself in today. Groupism is an idiot's retreat. Sadly, idiots are often in abundance in every ""group"".

Put very crudely, a diverse, but united society looks somewhat like [this](https://i.imgur.com/G1fRl6r.png). It's a beautiful mess of overlapping circles, each circle sharing some opinions, some not. A divided society is more like [this](http://www.mathisfunforum.com/showimage.php?pid=191816&filename=mutually+exclusive.GIF). It is very easy to draw a line of separation and make a fight out of it. That's what any enemy would love to have. That's what any enemy would dedicate their resources into. Following your echo chamber blindly is what leads to it.

We are better than that. ""Unity in Diversity"" is a mantra that might have lost its meaning due to its constant repetition since our childhood, but it is one of the core foundations of our great country.

I'm not saying one should suddenly start practising [vāāda-vidyā](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debates_in_ancient_India) in their online arguments. Remember the Human - but if you can't do that, at least Remember the Indian. ""Us vs Them"" is an immature rhetoric, but if you can't help yourselves, know that the ""Us"" is all of us. The ""leftists"", ""rightists"", ""sanghis"", ""bhakts"", ""librandus""... everyone. The only ""them"" is someone who's actively trying to sow a discord on various lines.

From Indian point of view, Kashmir was an independent kingdom that was attacked by Pakistan, and decided to join India for protection. Do I understand this correct?

So,

1. Why do some (most) Indians insist that Kashmir is an integral part of India, as if India has owned it for eons? It only joined India out of desperation 72 years ago, right?
2. Was the accession democratically decided? Was it supported by the majority of Kashmiris, or was it a personal decision of the king? Since India is a democratic country, shouldn't it look for a democratic accession instead?
3. Since Kashmir chose to join India, shouldn't it also have the right to choose to leave?

1313,"Why does this sub try to spread the idea that being single is better or even okay for not so young folks (30+) ? [SERIOUS]I see posts about being single, not being able to get into a relationship etc here from time to time. And this isn't surpising on this subreddit.

But I am surprised by the responses to these posts. I guess they may be so becuase a lot of people are trying to cope with being alone. I am not saying that one needs to get married by X age. I believe that marriage is a social construct and people can live their life perfectly without that. But I can't say that about relationships or a sexless life.

The responses I usually see are along the lines of I like to travel, I have more me time, I have my own goals and targets, I have more financial freedom etc. I feel all of this is less important than having intimate relationships. Looking at Maslow's hierarchy for instance intimate relationships are more important than achieving X, Y, Z goals or going on a vacation to Bahamas alone.

I do not understand how being single would feel good forever. First of all how do people, especially men, who are single meet thier intimacy needs? Unless you are someone who can get laid very easily the only way to achive that is to hire hookers. Are you doing that? If not don't you need intimacy, sex? 

The idea of not marraying is gaining more popularity with time across the world but being single isn't something that people generally push forward as something that is great in the long run. Sex, relationships or intimacy aren't a social construct and it surprises me when people here try to say that they can replace that by playing videogames, having a better bank balance, travelling freedom or not having to worry about someone else.",1569718241.0,,,dark,11,6

Found my 'creative' side and got into one of the top Design colleges of India, moved cities and have been living alone since. Was very fortunate to fall in love and stay in it - been living with her and have a couple of friends here and there.
Spending most of my time writing jokes (stand-up), writing songs (instrumentalist) and conducting a research on current Design Project and thesis. 
As far as my vision goes - India is full of ironies and beauty; I see a lot of scope for Art and Design but hardly see anyone valuing it as much as other countries do. I hope that changes and by the time I have a full fledged career, it's a more 'livable' place.

I've got my first job last yea. I'd gone through a real emotional turmoil during those 70+ odd interviews.

My hobbies are acting dramatics and i do like to write stories. But those are going to trash I guess.

I have started understanding the whole Football world by following those Premier League, UEFA, LaLiga, that is going on right now thank to reddit. And putting all that effort just so that I can converse and make more friends with people who are deeply involved in Football world. But still its the same people just ignore or forget about me.

The thing that saddens me the most is I see a lot of nay-sayers, shallow, less-knowledgable persons getting awesome jobs and girls but when I see myself that I'm doing all those work and not achieving I feel so much sad and I just look down on myself so much. I'm not some creep or introvert who can't make conversations I do try it and hold the conversation but why god why?

I was sitting and I saw another dude and realised oh this is the same guy who took my interview at Company ABC, so I tried approaching him and talking to him but he shrugged me away and later on said you might tell my current company ABC and they might fire me.  
>  
>So we both completed the task we both cleared 2 rounds of interviews and we both were rejected he has like 4+ years of experience and I have 1.5 years and later when I looked at him we both just laughed.  
>  
>I did mention this issue to recruiters agents kind of who set me up which they later told me yeah they didn't hire anyone. And such experience is not one time thing I have experienced this thing at least 30 times in past 14 months or even more than that.

 This might seem silly and downright idiotic to some people but I feel I just gotta do this one time. Either way after graduation, if I fail to land a job, I'll be on my own anyway.

1391,"Beginner cyclists of India: What's the best bicycle for office commute in India?I'm looking for a rather cheap bike for my office commute which is around 10 km from my home. I might go farther on the weekends but I don't really care much for optimizing my purchase for that.

My Requirements:
- Budget around 15 K (can go a bit higher if need be)
- My height - 5""11
- My Weight - 95 kg (I know, I know - I am working on it)


A few questions:

Road Bike or Hybrid? - I currently prefer upright ones, as I don't see much of a lot of benefit for me by riding a roadie. I think it will only cause discomfort to begin with.

Anyone wanna weigh in with opinions?

What about brands: Btwin vs Hercules vs Firefox (Or any other brand for that matter)?

Does the existence of gears matter much in traffic?

Do I need suspensions? I will be riding regular Indian roads, So i am bound to encounter a few bumps on the way.

What accessories should I opt, to start off with? (I have limited funds, so need to manage accordingly)

Sorry for asking too many questions. I guess this should help fellow beginners too.

1403,"Navratri ""fasting"" has become a jokeWhen I was a kid, I remember Navratra fasting being an actual thing where you would not really eat that much and deprive yourself of food.

Now every restaurant in my area has special Navratra menus. And all the menus have extremely heavy calorie-rich food. Pooris, kheers, special smoothies, and heck, even Navratra-special pastas. The only difference is that they use special flours and veggies.

Even the local grocery store has all these extremely heavy, deep fried Navratra special snacks.

How is this ""fasting"" again? If you're taking in as many calories as you used to, except its in the form of sabudana and not wheat, how does it make any difference whatsoever?

1419,"The tragic state of dentists in IndiaHi everyone,   
This is the first time I'm posting here. I've been a silent reader for many years.

I am here to highlight the tragic state of dentists and other medical professionals in India. The intention is not to rant, but to raise awareness so that the readers can share this perspective with their friends and family, some of whom may want to rethink their plans for a medical career staying in India. 

My friend is a dental (BDS) graduate from the best ranked dental college in the country. After 12th, he joined a good engineering college (Tier 2) because of the pressure he faced from his parents, but he was passionate about medicine and managed to get admitted into a BDS course after struggling for 1 year in engineering. He is currently a resident doctor at the hospital in his college and treats over 50 patients a day. I admire his stamina and dedication.

Since his fellowship ends in a few months, he was on the lookout for jobs in the private clinics (govt. clinics don't give jobs these days). After interviewing with some of the most well-known clinic chains, he came to me and shared his misery.   
**Private clinics offer Rs. 10000/-  a month for 10-12 hours work.** 

**Yes, you read that right. In some clinics, it goes upto Rs. 15,000/-. I was shocked to hear these figures. One can earn more by working as a cab-driver in any city.**   
In most countries, dentists are amongst the highest paid professionals. Yet, in India, they have to live on a poverty-level salary. My friend spends more than a few thousands every quarter to buy new tools because they need to be replaced to maintain hygiene standards. He has helped hundreds of patients, including critical cases, overcome their misery. People visit him from villages hundreds of kilometers away. And he gets offered 10000/- a month. **To put that into perspective, a dental clinic charges more than 5000 for a root canal treatment, which takes just 1 day of his time.** 

When we were discussing the reason for this, he said that the **Govts had opened up thousands of unregulated dental and medical colleges, and the graduates from these places don't get any clinical experience. Hence, many of them work for free at the clinics.** Most clinics don't distinguish between the quality and capability of the doctor- they just want someone with a degree and patient satisfaction is just not a concern**. He said that even MBBS graduates from state universities work for 20k a month in many places.** 

Hearing this, **I am actually sad that we keep saying that there aren't enough doctors, whereas the problem seems to be the total absence of regulation of the industry.** Now that the Govt is increasing the number of seats and allowing paramedics to work as clinicians, the problem will get worse. Already, many dentists work for free and I won't be surprised if in the future you might have to pay to work as a dentist in a clinic.   
 If anyone you know wants to pursue dentistry as a career, or even medicine, please let them know this side of the profession. Thank you.",1569723561.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,348,1030

The trainer complained about him to the building manager and in the last owners meeting they have voted to ban every tenant from accessing the gym!

The society hasn't formed yet and I heard from few owners that usually in these meetings, it's hardly about 5 or 6 owners attending, and these are very infrequent and ad hoc meetings.

I spoke with 10-15 owners as of now, and they have no  issue with tenants attending the gym. They even signed a petition in favour of the tenants. 

An owner posted the issue on owner's WhatsApp group and 75% of owners voted in favor of the tenants.

Most of the tenants owners also talked with the manager and the builder, but they are still hell bent on not allowing tenants!

Usually very few people attends the gym a day, and now the gym stays mostly empty (maybe it was the builder's motive!)

The promise of a gym was a decisive factor for us in renting out the apartment, and we are also bearing the maintenance costs!

So if you are familiar or have faced similar issue, I appreciate any inputs on what are our best available options.

\-------------------------

\#dontSCAMIndia

Shameful practise by fabindia. - Very poor post sales customer service.

\----------------------------------------------

TL;DR: Went to FabIndia Bangalore. I did not find the Saree I was looking for. Sales rep asked / coaxed me into ordering online and mentionedv""I can return the product anywhere in India within 30 days"". Go to another physical store and get refused asking me to talk to online department.

Online department refuses to accept the brand new item as sarees are in the list of their excluded items. I went to store again (today) and they still mention that sarees bought online can be returned online"". 

I am stuck with Rs.16000 worth brand new stuff which I do not like. 

I have now tweeted this at [https://twitter.com/rajeshperumal/status/1178002504434343936](https://twitter.com/rajeshperumal/status/1178002504434343936)

\----------------------------------------------

**Sept 11th - Visit Sarjapur FabIndia Store, Bangalore**

I go to the store looking for a particular Saree , the Saree is unavailable. Sales guy convinces me to order online and as I was skeptical

since I didn't see the Saree, proudly mentions that ""FabIndia has a great return policy of 30days all over India"".

&#x200B;

**Sept 17th - Saree gets delivered to my Chennai address.**

I order another color (red) as the blue one we earlier ordered didn't look good in person.

&#x200B;

**Sept 18th - The red saree gets delivered.**

We don't like both the Sarees and want to return them.

&#x200B;

**Sept 26th - Parents went to the store in Chennai but were asked to go online/call-customer support for return.**

&#x200B;

**Sept 27th -  Call with customer care about this.**

1 PM - They give me a shocker that the items are not returnable. He gives standard verbatim from his play-book. He says Saree's are excluded from return.

I ask to talk to his manager (Shyamal). I explain Shyamal the situation and tell him I have been misinformed and they need to take care of this situation. He asked me to send an email and that the management will consider (no commitment). I ask for his email to CC and he says there is no need for that and I again remind him this needs to be handled differently/special-case, as I was misinformed.

4.13 PM - Send an email with the photos of the sarees, order number and the incident.

4.54 PM - Get a standard template response. 

""We need to inform you that we are unable to process the return request for this item as this item falls under Non-Returnable category"".

**Sept 28th (Today) - Decide to go to the store and check with them again regarding the online return policy and they mention that I can return the Sarees bought online.**

1563,"My First Diwali Party - What should I wear? (US)Hello all,

My apologies if this isn’t the right place for this question (any recommendations on a better subreddit for this post will be gratefully received.)  

I have been invited to my first Diwali party. As you can probably guess from my last sentence, I’m not Indian, nor do I have any familial connection to India or any India-adjacent countries.) A (veeeeery senior) coworker and his wife throw this party every year and invite all of their Indian friends as well as EVERY INDIAN PERSON WHO WORKS FOR OUR COMPANY (this is a LOT of ppl - probably over 100 in coworkers alone.) Oh, and when I went to RSVP I saw that it’s being held at our local, super high-end, 5*, ridiculously expensive, world-renowned resort. 

So my question is, what should I wear? I love a reason to dress up as much as the next girl, and I am definitely appreciative of the beautiful saris and lehengas I’ve run across in my cursory outfit search. But would it look weird if I did go out and buy a lovely traditional Indian outfit? Will it be seen as rude or appropriative of your culture’s fashion? Should I just buy/rent a nice western evening gown instead? I just want to look appropriate! (And pretty!)

Oh, by the way, this is all taking place in an upper class area of the US, if that helps at all. Thank you for any help/advice you have to offer!",1569711363.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,13,6

I'm seeking information  / help on how to watch TV over internet via Apps or any other means.

**Some background:**

We have Hathway HD STB and everything was going fine until the idiotic TRAI move and from then on-wards our local cable provider / MSO is demanding 500Rs and is offering his created bouquets.. I have had enough of discussions. explanations and heated arguments with him on explaining that its now my freedom to choose the channels and pay for but since we are the only ones fighting for this he doesn't seem to bother anymore!

I have asked my parents to wait till Jio Giga Fiber launches but it appears to be a flop considering the cost and the way STB works (i'll have to work with my MSO for this)

**Current Situation:**

I have a smart TV at home and a spare PC as well that can be utilized to watch TV over internet.

I've lately noticed that Jio TV isn't allowing all channels and shows to be streamed and another observation that i have is even though the internet speed is more than enough for streaming / buffering somehow JIO works flawlessly on Jio network (Giga Fiber / Jio Net via Mobile hotspot)

It would be great if you guys can help me with apps that can get this accomplished for me, the primary channels that my parents watch are   StarPlus (not available in Jio), Sony (KBC doesn't work now) , SAB, Colors (I'm confident that BigBoss will not work as well)  


If I need to set up or turn a PC as android TV i'm happy with it.. all that i want is my parents to be able to watch above 4 channels with pleasant experience.

My first aim here is to get the above channels for free via cracked apps or any other means if possible, as i mentioned I'm open to setup PC into a media center and get the job accomplished.

Any help or suggestion is greatly appreciated",1569684857.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,19,10

Sale or no sale, a mere glance at the price graph of a particular product could be an eye-opener. There is nothing new about most e-commerce platforms hiking the price of products a few weeks or months before the 'grand sale', and bringing it back to the same price during the sale.  


But instead of taking a holy oath to never shop during a sale again, shoppers can try price comparison tools like  [Buyhatke](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/buyhatke/ojplmecpdpgccookcobabopnaifgidhf?hl=en), MySmartPrice to check price history of the products they wish to buy. Using these tools is no rocket science; just check whether or not the deduction in the price is genuine. If it's genuine, go right ahead with the purchase. If not, set a price alert to buy it for the best price in the future.

**3.  Use No cost EMI option or 'Pay Later' on Flipkart**  


Flipkart and Amazon recently launched the option for shoppers to pay for the product later, if they cannot afford to pay right away. However, the 'Pay Later' option has credit limit, which increases or decreases based on how timely the repayments have been made. So shoppers need to make sure their 'Pay Later' repayments are always on time, so that they can shop more expensive products during the sale.  


**4.  Look for the Best Price**  


Most shoppers just assume that the product listed on a sale is the best price they can get for it, which may not be true. Different e-commerce platforms have different profit margins for different products, which is why it is quite possible to find a better price for the product even when it is listed on a 'grand sale'.  


But shoppers can make sure they are looking at the best price with the help of price comparison websites like Buyhatke, SmartPrix, PriceCheckIndia etc.  


**5.  Apply Coupon Codes**  


Applying a coupon code is never the problem. The problem begins when the shopper has to swim through an ocean of coupons to find that one coupon which gets them the discount. And that is comparable to finding a needle in a haystack. So, a shopper finds it safe to assume that there are no available coupons for them.  


And while most shoppers would continue with their assumption, there are browser plugins like Buyhatke that find and apply all the coupons a shopper is eligible for, even the hidden ones, at the cart checkout. It is understandable that coupon codes could be a headache, but finding the right coupons always pays off.  


**6.  Look for Gift Card Discounts**  


Not many shoppers go the extra mile to find additional discount, especially when the additional discount is extra difficult to find. Also, one doesn't know what they don't know. For instance, not many shoppers know that there are platforms like Buyhatke Gift Cards, Cardpool, Woohoo.in and more, that allow shoppers to purchase e-commerce store gift cards at discounted rates. For example, one can purchase gift cards at a flat 3% discount on Buyhatke.  


So these were some of the top hacks that shoppers can use this sale season to shop smarter than ever. Shopping, whether out of fun or necessity, is something one cannot avoid. However, what can be avoided is spending more than they should.

I'm overly agreeable and that sickens me. I speak too softly and haven't dared to raise my voice when I'm being wronged. Nothing untoward has happened with me. But if someone's belittling me I won't stand up for myself.

I loathe this tendency of mine to be conciliatory. I'm incompetent at interacting with women. People tell me it could be because of an absent or unaffectionate mother. That isn't the case with me.

 Some friends unabashedly call me the woman in a man's body. Until now it didn't bother me. But now at 22 years old being thought of with contempt isn't appetizing. I want to change myself.

Also I'm insecure about my appearance. That's because I'm super short. I'm the height of a woman. My traits, appearance and the thoughts of others about me are making me uneasy.",1569690502.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,11,27

Especially states such as Rajasthan, Haryana, Bihar, UP, West Bengal, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and a few other others. 

I can't seem to understand why it came to be this way, given that they have good rivers, coal and other natural resources to accelerate their development process. Appreciate any insight, thoughts, or ideas you might have on this. Thanks!

I'm not an expert on Shaheed Bhagat Singh but I can certainly say I'm obsessed with him & it's certainly been for a while.

I   can post the usual stuff about his DOB, Family, Friends, Place of  birth  and all but trust me it's not worth it if we really don't  understand  who was Bhagat Singh.

This   is such an beautiful video by Piyush Mishra, I had posted it a while   back but it went totally unnoticed, I hope people won't neglected it   this time at least TODAY, I **reques**t  you to please watch this video. Piyush Mishra said & I quote ""He  wrote everything before he died, even the stuff happening today at the  mere age of **23 years 5 months & 26 days old** ""

**Highly suggested:** [My friend Bhagat Singh](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V7OQik_-dPE) (All you ever need to know).

Please don't proceed further if you are gonna skip the video because *""It's not about knowing a great soul, It's about changing your perspective about EVERY soul"".*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here   is my fav quote by Shaheed Bhagat Singh but again (Yes, I am over  exaggerating) I highly suggest  you to go through the above posted video  else it'll be **totally worthless**  to read about this great soul.

*""Any  man who stands for progress has to criticize, disbelieve and    challenge every item of the old faith. Item by item he has to reason out    every nook and corner of the prevailing faith. If after considerable    reasoning one is led to believe in any theory or philosophy, his faith    is welcomed. His reasoning can be mistaken, wrong, misled and  sometimes   fallacious. But he is liable to correction because reason is  the  guiding  star of his life. But mere faith and blind faith is  dangerous:  it dulls  the brain, and makes a man reactionary.""*

If  you really wish to know about him I suggest you to read ""Why I'm an  Atheist"" & if you wish to know his ideology I will recommend ""Bhagat  Singh Reader"" (Available on Flipkart & Amazon).

P.S. It will change your life.",1569643445.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,0,0

I am planning a North Indian trip, especially the Himalayan region, come end of Dec. I have 2 weeks off so want to make the best of it. I understand most of the roads will be closed due to snow and extreme temperature but I am sure people do travel during this time of the year,

My interests are some spiritual destinations, camping, stay with the locals. I am a non resident Indian and speak Hindi fluently, so no issues there.

It will be a solo travel but I am happy to join a group if there is one heading that way. I saw indiahikes.com and spitiecosphere.com and they do have some upcoming trips in Dec.

Would you recommend any places based on your personal experiences? 

The other option I am considering is to go for a 10 day Vipassana retreat in Dharamsala or Dehradun but that won’t really satisfy my travel itch. Would you recommend any other retreats which would focus on meditation as well as Yoga?

Thanks much!",1569635347.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,2,2

[https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d79k7b/unable\_to\_marry\_my\_gf\_intercaste\_issues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d79k7b/unable_to_marry_my_gf_intercaste_issues/)

Thanks to all who replied and gave advise.

Nothing has changed. Her mother is pleading her everyday now to get married to their choice of groom. She is quite upset with what is going on since she has no support over there. Her siblings are in favor of her but their voice hardly makes a dent. Her mother is torn apart as she is fond of me and wants this marriage to happen but her husband is stubborn to the core. Rest of the extended family do no know about this, but I am aware their thought process is not so backwards.

My father has suggested that he should call up her mother and let her know that this is a serious issue and this marriage needs to happen they're getting old and they would want me to settle down before something happens to them. 

Of course they will not agree at the first instance, but we believe some sort of pressure needs to be applied from our side, as her parents have avoided contacting us at all (particularly because I think her father is a coward who can only bully his family). 

I think that needs to happen. Letting them know that this is not a college crush that will fade away is a step in the right direction.

Any advise and all advise will be appreciated.",1569660638.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,4,1

I concede that the company isn't one that's highly respected. It's a small, growing company.

1845,"[LPT] Sale tips for the online sale seasonSales are a great time to buy all those things you have been holding on to buy but beware, sale prices may not always seem what it is. Here are a few tips:




Use a **price tracker** extension!    
Its dangerous online there, here take a few extensions to protect you from buying stuff at not their lowest prices.     



* [Keepa](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keepa-amazon-price-tracke/neebplgakaahbhdphmkckjjcegoiijjo?hl=en) for amazon. Nice graphs to actually visualise how the prices have been. And if somebody sneakily updated their price to give a steep discount. 
* [Price tracker](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/price-tracker-auto-buy-pr/hegbjcdehgihjohghnmdpebepnoalode?hl=en) does the same for flipkart.     



Follow deals on telegram. There are plethora of channels that update you when prices have hit rock bottom. Here are ones I follow:     



* https://t.me/desidime
* https://t.me/lootersjunction
* https://t.me/Online_Shopping_1      



And most importantly **USE COMMON SENSE**. Don't buy something just because it is at 3000 instead of 10,000. You are not saving 7,000 but actually spending 3000. Sales will keep coming. Its not armageddon and you are not going bankrupt(fingers crossed). So need not, want not.



Keep your debit and credit cards handy and please read the TOS for cards.      



Edit: As u/rwxrw-r-- pointed out, he has created a drop alert web app and shared in weekly hacker thread earlier, you might find it useful as well in saving some bucks :)

The General Consequence of the government selling onions is it will kill the private onion sellers who are selling the product just because the government is selling it at a fixed rate.
Once the government starts some scheme it never ends. The Onions will still be sold at 25 Rs even in 2050 AD. But it will continuously get subsidized by the taxpayers. Along with some nice scams where middle parties will sell it to the government at a huge price.

Once again does the Government need to get involved in this? This is literally communism having the government in every FUCKING THING. Has he forgotten license raj era. Government does not have the capability to involve itself in the market. It can only obsfucate the cost.

Say In Future, Government will kill all other onion sellers then mandate a fixed price for the crop. Good luck getting farmers to grow onion, they will run to other products and we will have even less onions than before.",1569601659.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,19,0

2078,"Scale of corruption in India is just mindblowingOfcourse we all know corruption in India is very bad and is what is holding this country back.

But recently it hit me actually how bad it is.

If anyone is following the US politics, Obama's Vice president Joe Biden is now running to be the opponent to Trump for 2020 election. Recently, a scandal came out where Biden's son, who has absolutely no background in oil and gas whatsoever was appointed to the board of a ukranian oil company, while his dad was the vice president of the US. Then turns out that company was getting investigated by the ukraian government, but after biden's son joins, Joe biden openly tells the Ukranian government to fire the investigator looking into the company his son was on the board of. If they dont, Ukraine would not get $1 billion aid that year. 
Obviously, that investigator gets fired. 
This is obvious corruption, the company got scared when it was investigated, so it added US Vice president's son to its board, forced the US vice president to get the Ukrainian president to fire the investigator. This is some international, inter president level corruption. This might as well take down Joe biden's hopes of beating trump in 2020.

Coming to the point, you know how much that ukraian company was paying Vice president's son for all this? $50,000 a month. They paid him $600,000 in one year. That is all. It is less than 4 crores. Think about that. 
4 crores to get the fucking vice president of United fucking states to pressure president of your country to cancel investigation into your company. And this 4 crore scam is about to end this guy's presidential ambitions.

Compare that to corruption in India. A small time MLA makes more than 4 crores a year in bribes. Just think of how much money is flowing in India into all these politicians. 

Political corruption in India is at a whole different level. It makes me laugh when they keep saying ""how can this vice president's son get  $50k a month!!!!"" that is peanuts even in India. In the US, it is even less. You can buy a BMW 3 series with 50k, that is all.

Beyond feminist rights and stuff, men are also harassed and troubled to very inappropriate conditions!

After travelling for 1 year daily for my college, I can 100% claim that delhi metro causes many problems for men

Some girls will come up to the occupied seats and will make you stand to give them the seat! But yeah come on! Men are strong right?

There are some other incidents which happened are:

1. Security staff while scanning threatened me to break my earphones (Yes, I know the rules and were wearing them absent minded and was trying to remove them ASAP when he made this remark!) 

To defend my action, I also told the security person to look at 3-4 girls who were wearing earphone, for which another security person came to me and said ""beta itna dharaye lagunga bahar nhi niklega, aur ye ldkio ko bta diya na tere pe rape case laga dengi""

2. I was travelling back from college after exams, and with group of friends we were discussing exam paper with jolly way, in which a middle age woman scolded us that we should know how to properly stand in metro (That women was talking over phone, so I think she was getting disturbed by our talks! Sigh!)

3. One fine monday morning, a person standing right next to me, started shouting at me to stand properly and behave like I would in my house, he was not listening a word of mine and was shouting at top voice to create a scene!!

These are few incidents which made me write the following discussion!

I am not pointing out to female counterpart, but yes they are major reason for which I want to discuss with you people! Lets discuss this problem guys! Open up your problems and tell your incidents which happened with you! And how you all cope with these types of problems?",1569605944.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,28,5

2100,"Need career adviceI'm in grade 10, Mumbai and want to prepare for JEE (my choice, no pressure). Now I'm being advised by everyone to go for dummy school with coaching. However I'm a bit skeptical about this as my experience with coaching/tuition is not great and that is the reason I'm going to no tuition currently. But JEE is on another level and I might not be able to perform well in it without help. I feel that coaching institutes drain the juice out of you, and hated the foundation classes I went last year. My question is, is it possible to crack JEE with only school or school + coaching as I know I will need some help but dummy schools really seem depressing to me and based on my experience, I have understood and enjoyed learning things better at school as they let you think about it and mess with it whereas in coaching it's like solve 100 numericals in x amount of time. Not that I hate problems, but solving only problems seems to drain the subject for me. Also, if you are from IIT, do you think that you could have done it if you were going to school or school + coaching? Is there anybody from IIT who has been selected there without going to dummy school? Thanks

TL;DR - Grade 10 student here aiming for IIT CS and doesn't want to go to coaching as he doesn't like it. Is it possible to crack JEE without coaching? Has anybody of your mates done it? Could you have done it without dummy school if you are from IIT?",1569576931.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,12,11

2142,"[Earphone Advice] Wide Budget Range Leading to ConfusionHello gentle redditors, myself a noob at Earphones, and Headphones. Sorry for long post.

I listen to Opeth, Menwhopause, Ghulam Ali Ghazals, lots of Instrumentals (Yann Tiersen, Paganini, Beethoven etc), Indian Classical, Punjabi songs and watching Movies. I have used the following earphones in chronological order -

1) Sennheiser MX150 - Good for beginners. Used to pain a lot. Poor build quality, replaced once in warranty.

2) Sennheiser CX180 - Upgrade from MX150. Only after getting ES18, realized that they were SHIT. Poor build quality. Could not replace under warranty due to my own foolery.

3) Philips SHE - BAD build quality. Didn't like the sound either, so returned.

4) Soundmagic ES18 - HUGE upgrade from any past earphones. But BAD build quality. Replaced 1 earphone in warranty. 

5) KZ ZS3 - Better than ES18. 90% of Byrons. But nothing exceptional. It was a nightmare managing its detachable wires, which got loose over time. Bought the Bluetooth module, which stopped working after 4-5 months. Now one of its earpiece has gone missing.

5) Beyerdynamics Byron (Rs. 1999) - EVEN BIGGER upgrade from ES18. Liked them a lot, but they stopped working one fine day 5-6 months back. Have sent them for replacement last week, but since Byrons are not being made anymore, they are refunding me the amount.

6) Soundmagic E10C (Rs. 900) - They were almost same as Byrons. Bought them *Refurbished* from Amazon. Gave it to my sister. Most VFM earphones yet.

Now I am getting refund for my Byrons. I can add atmost a 1000 bucks to this amount, 

but **I would prefer to spend as low I can**. So below are my options - 

1) Audio Technica CLR100 - Rs. 595 (Someone on Reddit said that they resemble the sound of the famed M50X)

2) Audio Technica COR150 - Rs. 749

3) FiiO F1 - Rs. 1049 (Refurbished) (New Stock is NOT available anywhere)

**4) Soundmagic E10C - Rs. 1099/999 (Refurbished)**

5) Audio Technica ATH S100 - Rs. 1229 

6) JAYS t-Four Wireless - Rs. 2999 (Refurbished for Rs. 2499) 

7) Audio Technica ATH-M20X - Rs. 3299 (Refurbished) (Will it work with Poco F1? or DAC is required?)

**I am inclined to go for refurbished Soundmagic E10C again**, if any other option doesn't *offer much more* than what it offers. So kindly compare all the options with respect to E10Cs. Eventually 1-2 years down the line, I will upgrade to Audio Technica ATH M50X.

&#x200B;

Few Points - 

I don't prefer Sony or JBL earphones, coz they are Bass biased. I like my music flat with clear vocals and good sound-stage.

I also don't want to go for RHA MA390 and the ChiFi. Heard a lot about Tinaudio T2, but my past experience with Chinese goods hasn't been really good. So not going to take anymore chances.",1569599374.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,27,19

2151,"Mythological ConflictMost of the time, when we hear about any situations or incidents, be it wars or governments, we tend to choose our side depending upon our level of perception. Being in a neutral is quite difficult most of the times. The understanding depends on our upbringing, be it because of parents, siblings, friends, society, region, religion or the scriptures one's following. But can the scriptures depicting mythology be absolute right? The term mythology has, in fact, its origin from the word myth, defined as a widely held but false belief or idea, just like the belief of electric current flowing from positive terminal to negative terminal.

&#x200B;

In Hinduism, we always consider Devas to be the angels and Asuras to be the devils. The Devas are the one responsible for establishing righteousness in the life of a person and society. They are the one who is our protector in the difficult times caused by the Asuras. The Devas sometimes come to help us by themselves, or they need to be evoked by yajna, a pious process involving hymns, chantings and offerings to the fire.

&#x200B;

But is history always the same as we are told or is it written with some biases or sometimes, total biases? Do the events and outcomes happened as depicted, or they happened as per the writer's perception? How can one be sure the events happened thousands of years ago by reading only one side of the story?

&#x200B;

Going further to the west, the tale of the mythology is the same with the role reversal. In the Zoroastrian culture, the Ahuras are responsible for bringing righteousness in the person or society. They are the ones who are protecting the people from the wrong deeds of the Devas. The Devas are the mayhem creator. The people evoked the Ahuras through 'Yasna' during their troubled times. The 'Yasna' service, which is offering to the water, is the recitation of the 'Yasna' texts recited by an experienced priest. The Ahuras are the angels, and the Devas are the devils according to the Zoroastrian beliefs.

&#x200B;

Many of the people might question how I have found the similarity between the Ahuras and the Asuras. It is because of the Persians. It was them how river Sindhu (Indus) became Hindu, and Sindhustan became Hindustan. The Persian Empire was mainly established in present-day Iraq, and the Zoroastrian was prevalent in Iran. The words first came to the Persians and then to the Zoroastrians, and they changed form according to their alphabets.",1569602595.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,18

2164,"Social awkwardness, my storyWhen I confess to people who've  become good friends that I have a little social anxiety, they're generally taken back. That just means that my farce of appearing happy and fulfilled  and un-lonely works. Mid term exams end tomorrow and I know that people are going to be having great fun tomorrow, out with friends and stuff. They already have plans. I don't, because I can form a good 'first impression' with people(because that's what they teach in articles and YT videos) idk how to build and maintain friendships. It's weird. Half the school knows who I am, but no one knows who I hang with. Maybe people just assume that I've got other great friendships outside of school but like I'm kinda lonely actually. Mostly I don't have a problem with that but in times like now, when my parents have left the city for 2 days and when I sat down to think all that I could do with this freedom, I don't know what I should do, other than holing up like I always do.

I guess all of this started when I went to stay with my grandparents from class 3 to class 6, and that's great because most kids don't get all that time with their grandparents. I love them a lot, but they practically put a hold in my social development, now that I look back because I wasn't really allowed to go to friends' houses, or to birthday parties. I had to be back at 6 even though it was a fenced apartment building. I studied a lot, and that's mostly all I did, except a bit of drawing, which I liked very much, and which I learnt from this one Scholastic book my parents bought me. I was like at peace with them , but I don't think I was very happy. When I went back to live with my parents, it was like the train of having friends and squads and stuff like that had already left the station. It was like skipping a class even though you're dumb. People knew how to do that stuff, having friends and all. I started going to birthday parties a little, when I was invited, which was rare but that's all I saw of my classmates outside of school.

I'm in class 12 right now, and I'm doing my studies all well, hitting the gym 3 times a week, doing a good bit of self help but I'm still lonely. When I was in class 9, when the anxiety and self consciousness first kicked in, I looked up to the class 12 me, and how cool would I be, un-lonely and all but things aren't looking up for me. I had one friend, a good friend, but I'm distancing myself from her because she's kinda toxic and now it's just me and my parents I guess. Idk what the fuck to do man, having done all that - 'put yourself out there' and 'every shot not taken is a shot missed' and I do succeed in making acquaintances of strangers, and well, I think , but they never transition to becoming friends.

2208,"I think I know why the Indian education system fundamentally sucks.So I was reading another post, and in that there was a comment with a sentence:

>I was super interested in physics and understood the basics thoroughly but I don't give a shit now because I don't see it's utility.

While I was formulating a reply to express my disappointment, I recalled my first few weeks of Class 11.

Even though I went to a school which at the time was an extremely prestigious one which charged over a lakh rupees in tuition fees and had all sorts of amenities, and at least officially the teachers cared about teaching, nothing can save the course syllabus. Seriously.

Why Class 11? Because this is the time you begin to learn calculus. The funny thing is, as an 11th-year student you've never done Calculus before, and it is required in both your Physics and Mathematics classes. At least in the CISCE curriculum for ISC examinations.

The problem is that the physics curriculum doesn't wait for the mathematics curriculum to teach you calculus. You're forced to use a tool that you have no fucking clue about. Sure you're blindly copying some derivations and shit that your teacher shows you on the board, but you don't even understand how the fuck differentiation works. You don't see how `v = dS/dt`, when your whole life you've learned that `v = [S1-S0]/[t1-t0]`. Sure you could say that differentiation deals with instantaneous velocity and the other formula gives you the average velocity, but at that time you are not even familiar with Leibnitz notation, as you're actually learning about limits. Differentiation IIRC started in the second half of the 11th year syllabus, and integration was taught in Class 12.

Chemistry is even worse. There is absolutely no connect with what is being taught. As a student you're told to memorise thousands of different chemical equations relating to different reactions, like titration, redox (etc etc) in Classes 9-10, then the next two years tack on a lot of advanced physics. But the problem is, you don't actually understand WTF is going on at the molecular level. Your chemistry teacher is just dictating a lot of notes that don't make a lot of sense to you. You're asked to do some stupid projects which are 200% plagiarised in all four of your board years (although the training starts as early as at least Class 6). The lab classes are ridiculous because you're told to follow stupid procedures and steps, without any explanation of what's dangerous. You're given access to toxic chemicals and concentrated acids - I had the dubious distinction of getting minor acid burns in my hand because some dumbass wasn't careful. For titration you used pipettes where you have to suck shit out with your fucking mouth, and the pipe is fucking shared with other classmates - hygiene be damned.

I studied the sciences, so I cannot speak for the Commerce and Arts experience.

Seriously, if our education system cares about its students, create a curriculum that the students can understand and relate to. Teach them how to learn. All you fuckers do is force them to memorise, and that too not in a very good way - Japan is notorious for rote learning and still produces much better research output at the university level.",1569602312.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,102,172

2384,"American Proposing to Indian Girlfriend - How to involve parents?Hello! I am a Catholic Caucasian American who is planning to propose to my Hindu Indian girlfriend next month after a little less than three years of dating. I met her parents after four months of dating, but they live in India while we live together in the US.

Her parents seem to be mildly fond of me, but I believe it's mainly because of the distance and language barrier (they both speak English, but her mom gets nervous speaking to me). Her dad and I both have interest in finance, and the one time I met him, he lectured me about how dating is not as big in India and how marriage means marriage for life, it was a lot for four months of dating but it was cute. Anyway, I think everyone would approve of this from both sides, which is great. 

What I don't know is how do I broach this to her parents? I plan to propose in late October while she and I are on a vacation, so I should probably act on this soon. In America, the boyfriend asks the girlfriend's father for ""permission"". I'm not super old school so I don't have to do it that way, but I'm curious what do Indian parents expect? Is there some sort of ettiquette I should follow? Are there any other steps before proposal I should be aware of?

Advice and anecdotes are appreciated! Thanks!

Edit: I asked her parents and they were very happy to hear this (mostly her mom, her dad is very poised and stoic but nice). They immediately said they are ok with it if all other parties are, and of course my GF and I are and I already spoke with my parents and they can't wait because they love my GF.

Intermittent fasting

5:30-9:00 eating period

5:30- snacks and milk (snacks are most likely not healthy, eg. single somosa, puff, whatnot because that is what you get)

6:00 - 5 fruits -(apples, orange, mosambi)

6:45 - 1 handful of the following nuts (walnuts, cashews, haldiram moong dal) and 15-20 almonds

7:30 onwards upto 9:00 - two rotis, 2-4 cup dal, 2 pieces chicken or 1 egg (on tuesdays, either of these are not available and instead the mess provides with channa or rajma. I eat a lot of that.)

1 HIIT, 2 strength training and 2 steady state cardio per week.

So he end up paying for dance through his card or something related to mobile number. Similarly buying musical instruments linked to mobile number

Background: 10th class really hated physics and chemistry. I still don't understand how I scored 86% with how bad I did with science. Now the choice were commerce or arts. 

And Family were like arts kya lega jindagi barbad Karni hai kya, so yeah I took commerce and I honestly liked it but I fucked up in my 12th scored 71% and thanks to that I had to enroll bcom in a local  college. completely wasted my 2 years there, it was in my final year that I decided I had to think about my future and studied very hard and tried to pull my grades as high as I could final gpa 7.32.  Placements were all bpo job only gave interviews didn't join any of them.
Because of my marks in 12th and grad I decided not to pursue MBA also didn't want to waste my parents money ( we aren't financially well off) and went for professional course.
 
Choices were CA/CS/CMA ,CA takes minimum 5-7 years all cleared in 1st attempt which I doubt I could have done. Kudoos to everyone pursuing CA . CS is all about law and rot learning as I have heard so again no go. So I enrolled in CMA inter this June.

With everyone telling how difficult it is to clear these professional exams and our institute's struggle to attract students makes me feel really skeptical if made the right choice. So I wanted some insights from CMAs  or CA/CS who know CMAs  how good is the scope ? What can I do after clearing this? Can I appear for final while doing my articleship? How do I get into a good firm for articleship? And which one should I join a firm or company?

2397,"Would compulsory service help the youth?I've read a bit about this and wanted to know what the Reddit janta think:

Do you think individuals between the age of 18-21 should clock in at least 6 months (or any suitable time period) in service? That could be the army, or driving ambulances or being in the paramilitary, basic paralegal work, fire-brigade, etc (or something suitable?)

My rationale is that when young adults are forced to work in situations that require participation, team work and undertaking responsibilities their world view would mature a bit. They will also learn very important life skills. 

Furthermore, these fields are currently understaffed do not require extensive training. Fresh blood would bring vigour and get work done faster. 

This kind of came in my head when I saw news anchors saying ""Yes to war"" and stuff like that post Balakot. These people never held a gun and tried to defend a fellow citizen irrespective of their caste or religion. 

Anyway, I would like the youth to have more option and not have compulsory ""military"" service like it is done in many other countries. I have read the problems associated. But places like Austria allow for community service and I think that is important.

2398,"What do you think about West Bengal and Bengali people in general?I am from Bengal and honestly, I don't know what to think about my state. I feel very confused as I get contradictory information about my state.

The general perception of Bengalis (as per my anecdotes) is that our culture is rich, our language is the sweetest (certified by UNESCO...yes, many people actually believe that), but our education and economy is in ruins. They say that you do not have much scope if you stay in Bengal, that our economy is really bad, and that our job opportunities are really low. Usually, most people in my experience, try to get out of Bengal and try to settle in Mumbai or something. But again, a lot of people have jobs here in Bengal and they are happy. Recently a friend of mine from an engineering college in Kolkata got placed and his entire batch got good jobs. Many acquaintances of mine have got good jobs, even after passing BSc from an open university. Some guy on Reddit showed me articles which showed that economy is actually doing pretty well in several sectors. Plus, we have very modern parts of Kolkata like New Town and Salt Lake city which are examples of growing industries and companies in Bengal.

Now, as for the people here, from my experience, Bengalis are very ethnocentric and believe their culture to be way superior to other cultures, especially to central Indian ones. From what I have gathered from people online so far, people from outside WB think very lowly of us. They think our economy is in tatters, that our language is funny, and that our Bengal is crawling with 'pseudo-intellectual commies' (even though, I can assure you, the CPIM is dead here). Many bhakts say that our Bengal has been taken over by mullahs and Mamata is a Muslim prostitute appeasing Muslims. From my experience, yes, Mamata does engage in appeasement of Muslims and we do have a lot of corrupt politicians and goons. But from the news, apparently, other states don't have it any better. Rather, I would say that Bengal is in a better condition that, say, UP.

2413,"[Rant] Tired of hitting the reset buttonLong ass post. No tl;dr, fuck off, I'm pissed at myself. I'm also a nice person in general, so sorry for that!

I've had enough! I just can't abide myself to a self-disciplined lifestyle. Every time I look in the mirror, I see this potato shit face that I hated and vowed to myself as a teenager not to turn into. And here I am, looking exactly opposite to what I imagined myself to be. I'm 31 M with a full-time job living in a foreign land. On paper, everything looks great. It fucking isn't. Physically, I'm this uncle with receding hairline, MRF wale cycle tyres on my waist, skinny hairy hands, pathetic back posture and acne! Fuck my life!! When I sit, I can actually feel my inflated tyres and saggy moobs. Mentally, I'm sad almost all the time. I was sad back when I was in India and I'm sad now. I've been sad, depressed and desolated ever since that stupid dumb witch left me 6 years ago. I fuckin' hate you!! I was kinda super awesome 6 years ago, man!!

&#x200B;

I've been trying to get back to a happy life. And failed multiple fucking times. Every other week, I come with this plan to lose weight and get ripped. I don't set overly ambitious goals either, I know I'm a lazy ass procrastinating moron. Who is always ready to bail and then commit to a new ""challenge"" soon after. I'm tired fapping to poonam pandey's flat butt and then looking at my pathetic-sad-acne-smeared-face reflection on the black screen after the show is over. Damn, that's when my morale hits so low, it can smell oil.

&#x200B;

But then I somehow manage to pick myself up. Start with a clean slate. And then, guess what. Fuck it up again. I'm so tired of this cyclic never ending saga. Our saas-bahu series with plastic surgery comebacks have had better results. Heck, I wouldn't date or even befriend myself. I'm not on social networking sites, other than reddit and yet, I end up checking my phone every 5 mintues. No one messages me, but I just open WhatsApp, scroll through the contacts, see the last-seen of the person I last messaged and draw conclusions why then haven't replied. I scroll through Reddit looking for NSFW content. And when I finally find this, I look up for a chain that leads me to a new NSFW sub and fap.   I have such a disgusting personality.

&#x200B;

The thing is, I know I have it, man! I know I have it in me to land in a healthy relationship, approach women and get fit and clean up. I know deep down, the fire is still fucking lit. It was always burning. I was a genuinely interesting guy. I had cool hobbies, like dj-ing songs, playing around lightroom and research about musician deaths (kurt cobain likes), just for the fun of it. And write these humorous blogs about random ass banana shit balls. I was so passionate about life and had dreams. I still want to learn new stuff, but instead I just cuddle up in my bed, sharing a drink with loneliness and netflix. I don't go out, because fuck my face, it looks worse than B'lore roads with craters and bumps. And I feel so conscious. Please don't fucking link me to the acne or skinaddiction subs.

But I need to buckle up and start grinding...how!! How the fuck do I stay motivated!! Hate myself so much. Hope to reach a happier, less resentful stage in life.

&#x200B;

Update: Holy fuck!! Did not expect to get any response. So overwhelming. You folks have taken time out of your lives to help me out. Thanks guys, you're all awesome. Honestly, I was super low and frustrated yesterday when I posted this. Got drunk and passed out soon after. I'm reading through your feedback and I get it. I need to quit being a bitch about all this. Your kind and wise words is something I'll work on. Thank you guys.

Which cities would have been larger in such a scenario in comparison to real life and which cities would have been smaller in such a scenario in comparison to real life?

For instance, I was wondering if Calcutta (Kolkata) would have been larger while Dhaka would have been smaller due to Calcutta being a much larger city than Dhaka was in 1947 and thus being a more attractive target for Bengali Muslim migrants than Dhaka in a scenario--which differs from real life due to the fact that, AFAIK, after the partition, moving to Calcutta en masse wasn't actually an option for Bengali Muslims in real life. Also, I'm presuming that there would have been no Islamabad in this scenario since there wouldn't actually be a need to create such a city due to there being no Pakistan in this scenario. I also wonder if Karachi might have been smaller in this scenario and Lahore larger.

Anyway, any thoughts on all of this?",1569554389.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,75,91

2720,"<Advice> Which phone to buy from Big Billion days/ Amazon great Indian festival?I am going to gift my wife a mobile for our anniversary. Looking for suggestions to select one finally. My budget is around 15k but I can extend it a little bit.  She doesn't have any preferences as she is not really into tech but I have listed the requirements and uses of the mobile.

There are some great upcoming offers and after watching several youtube videos, I have shortlisted a few with their pros and cons.  I am looking to buy one which gives the best value for money.

# Requirements

* Watching movies and sitcoms
* Longevity. We don't change phones often. Would like one to last a longer time
* Durable: Should not easily break when falling or any small
* Decent battery life
* Decent photos and selfies
* Easy to repair/some sort of warranty
* 6 Gb Ram so that it is future proof with the android updates
* No Gaming requirement.

**Now, here is my short list till now**

&#x200B;

1. **Samsung M30 S Cost (17k for 6gb variant)**

**Pros**

Amazing huge 6000mah battery

sAmoled display

Samsungs brand and service centres

Great overall package at the price

One UI is great

Samsung will probably roll out updates for it

**Cons**

It is a new phone. So, No comprehensive reviews available.

Don't know how durable it is if it falls or gets any damage or water splashes

Would  samsung intentionally push updates that slows down mobiles to pushes buyers to buy new phone?

Is exynos processor as good as snapdragons in the other phones? Will it slow down and lag after a year?

&#x200B;

**2. Vivo Z1 Pro (6gb variant will cost around 15 or 16k probably(not revealed yet). 4gb is priced at 13k)**

**Pros**

Been around for a few months with comprehensive reviews praising it and no issues with the devices from users who have bought it.

It aces durability tests and not easily damaged

Good 5000mah battery

Front camera is 32 megapixels

**Cons**

UI is not that great apparently

Dont know anything about Vivos service

Dont know if device will be provided updates

Rear camera is 16 mp but I'm ok with it.

&#x200B;

**3. Real me pro 5 (6gb at 15k)**

**Pros**

Amazing specs at low prices

Great reviews and recommendations from youtube and mobile websites

**Cons**

UI is not that great apparently

Dont know anything about Realme  service

Dont know if device will be provided updates

&#x200B;

I was interested in Vivo Z1x but decided against it because it does not have expandable memory. I have not considered mi A3 because of people complaining about the intrusive ads in the UI that just wont stop.

Due to which when power trips (which happens multiple times in a day), the Wi-fi  gets turned off and internet is disconnected. The backup generator in my apartment society isn't automated and so for those 2-5 minutes while someone turns it on, my internet connections remains off. This is a major headache if I am connected to office VPN or taking a conf call. I am looking for a backup for my Wi-fi  router for that short 2-5 minutes.  

Looking for it on amazon gives ""Resonate RouterUPS CRU12V2 Power Backup for Wi-Fi Router (Black)"" and its variants as the only option. Other UPS are quite big and mostly for backup of whole house which I don't need.

I currently own a OnePlus 6T, and although the phone is good, day by day my hatred for this ugly as shit notch is growing exponentially.

I'm planning to buy a new handset which is, as a choice, better or equal to my current, but with no notch. I'll give my preference down below.

* Price less than 60k.

* Bezels or bezel-less, doesn't matter, but no notch.

* Camera is not a huge deciding factor. I barely click pics with my 6T even.

* ~~I was going for 1+ 7 pro, but it's way too huge n heavy for my avg size hands. So a normal human sized phone is preferred.~~ Actually scratch that, I just want the phone to be easy to handle.

We could still have the one passport for the union. Free movement and trade across states. Maybe even open up to neighbours (Bangladesh, Nepal, Myanmar) to be a part of the union. There would be no single leader of the union, only representatives. There would be one representative for the Union with no power to make decisions or enter into agreements unapproved by the council.

Edit - To those of you referring to various sources to claim that we are a ""Union"", I respectfully disagree. This is why I referred to the EU as an example and not the Soviet Union. We have a single leader, other countries refer to India as a country, every country must have it's own defense forces. These are just off the top of my head.

2749,"Learn from my experience : Don't share your business ideasI want to highlight a mistake I did in 2019--I wanted to do business with my friends and had many interesting business ideas. I ended up sharing 4 different ideas with 4 different friends for partnership -- as in we invest half effort and money.

So far THREE yes 3/4 of them HAVE STOLEN my ideas and have started the business without even telling me.

I used to think the common cliche - ideas are worthless and execution is everything. That ideas are worth a dime a dozen. But I was wrong. Ideas are indeed worth something that I feel robbed after doing the stupidity of sharing it with people I didn't had a genuine bond with. I thought it would be cool to do business with friends.

To combat this I have decided on following strategy

\-Not provide them with any intellectual help in execution. (There are hundreds of ways I can improve the execution of them, and I'd probably help a stranger for free but I have not entertained requests for any more support. Trust me ALL 3 of them have ASKED for FURTHER HELP from ME to execute the projects --nope, not happening).

\-Decided to NEVER reveal a business model to anyone unless I am 100% sure about that person. \[ I can count such people on my finger tips\].

\-Move on with life, shit happens.

\-Continue to be their friend for the time being but CUT DOWN all business/profession/money/help etc talks to ZERO.

I hope someone can pickup from my mistake and not repeat what I did. Cheers !

I also get tired pretty quickly, most days on coming home from college I just wanna lay in my bed and not move, I get that fatigued. I also cannot concentrate in class, I almost always drift away. When I'm alone and trying to study, my mind always gets distracted by negative thoughts, sense of impending doom and stuff about how I could change my past if I could go back with the knowledge I have now. It really frustrating, the last time I think I really put some effort into academics was in 10th grade, after which I only used to scrape through in junior college exams and actually had to give my 12th boards once again because my PCM average was too low to get admission in any engineering college. Now, I have 16 backlogs and I'm in final year so needless to say I need my mental health to get in shape if I wanna clear all that up before my course is through. My home life is also somewhat messed up, so I get additional trauma from there too.

Now, coming to the main point, I did consult a psychiatrist who prescribed me some anxiety meds and some Vit. D supplements(she told me to get it tested) when it turned out I was deficient, but it hasn't really worked out. I read online, from reddit and also several other articles that deficiency of certain vitamins, zinc ,magnesium etc can cause depression and fatigue, which I'm suffering. I think this is the reason, because I'm really thin (10-15kg underweight) and was always a weak kid growing up ,and my diet is not very balanced. Basically I want to know if:

1.)there's any kind of test to check my Vit D, Vit B , Magnesium, Zinc, Iron and Selenium levels at once?

2.) Also can anyone tell me how much all of these tests will cost?

3.)What kind of doctor should I consult if I have any doubts regarding the tests and to prescribe me meds if needed based upon the result?

Since then i am living with my mom and grandparents (fraternal) i dont know why my mom decided to live her after my father died. My grandparents are very very restrictive and are as close as you get to boomers. Hating mobiles and technology in general. I don't have anyone except my mom who i say really care for me and keeps a check. I have no real friends and had no girlfriends. I have a girl but we never made it official and she left me without any explanation. It still hurts and it has been every difficult to cope up with.
Here comes all the problems i have a really really bad life rn. I wanted to do something in stem especially cs or programming but i can't. Because My grandfather who is 65 and is the only earning source wants me to join his business . I have to go to his business to learn and so that i can learn his business and earn a living. Money is decent like 20 grand a year which is decent in india. I hate that business it's very boring. However he has allowed me to go to college. Thanks grandpa. My schedule is fucked up. I go to uni at 7 am come home at 3 and than go to shop at 4 and come home at 10 pm.

I also have fucked up health i have Gluten allergy, diabetes, thyroid, chronic back pain, kidney stone and i am obese and my liver is in pretty bad shape lol many more things i can't remember 
After shop i run to gym and come home at 11 pm.

That leaves no time for my passion of programming and video editing. I love uploading videos on youtube and its the only thing which calms me.

I don't even get 8 hours to sleep but still i sacrifice my sleep and work till late night. I am not insomniac instead i m a very heavy sleeper but reddit i am not getting enough sleep


My business is going down too lol and i see no future ahead

I didn't had real friends. I had a very wasted childhood and shitty teenage and my future looks very very dark
I don't know what to do. I have no one who really loves me except my mom but no one to share my feelings with. I don't have anyone who really understands me.

I am very very ambitious i want to do something remarkable not for money but i want to be not forgotten i want to be different and unique and successful but i see nothing ahead.
Every teacher and every professional i meet seems to find me very intelligent and different but i dont see it anymore. I feel like a loser and just plain stupid 

I also have started to get suicidal thoughts but i wont ever do that. I hope so......

I am losing hope in future day by day....

We don't have access to free healthcare and education, we don't get unemployment and other welfare benefits.
I mean YES, you have government schools and hospitals, but a privileged person like me would not go to either, knowing the standards of these facilities. You get what you pay for. 
Government welfare schemes are just namesake even for the low income strata of the society. For instance, it breaks my heart to see how midday meals are actually served in schools. 

There are so many goddamn taxpayers in India! I'm sure if the money is utilized properly, we'd see better public facilities around us, and we could all seek utility from them. 

As a ""privileged"" citizen, the only public resource I use is literally pothole filled roads which would kill me someday. Given the number of people who have to use roads, I'm sure the government makes enough money to maintain its roadways and make up for other connected costs. 

The percentage of income tax we pay still seems like too much of a trade off for all the infrastructural facilities we have around us combined. 

There's so much that's being eaten away in the middle, and hence the dissent with politics in our country. 

I get that we have to take upon and share the burden of taxes in a welfare state, but we'd be glad to get reliable accounts of what has been done with the money. 

I am not taking indirect taxes into consideration, just income taxes.

Am I missing something here? I'm sure other countries give a better a trade off for the percentage of taxes that we are paying here.

If you have anything to suggest, what can I do at an individual level to contribute to better infrastructural facilities?",1569480612.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,43,24

Today I got an angry call from one of a prospective client after he saw my estimate for his project because he thought I was ripping him off.

To give an idea, the project was to set up a chain of e-commerce sites, with one main website which he would have had the control of and multiple child sites which would have had conditional access to the main website's inventory of products. His clients would have paid him to get a child site which has access to his inventory of products. He also asked for a setup where he would set the price on his inventory which would then automatically get reflected to the child sites.

My quote was of 760 hours total time estimate with a Rs 600 hourly rate \~ Rs 4,60,000. Which would have given the client an complete system for managing his entire ecommerce business from a single dashboard.

While on the call he mentioned that someone is willing to do the same work for Rs 30,000 initial fees for the main website and Rs 1600 for each child site. I guess that he would be using WordPress + woocommerce and handling the entire database manually for product pricing changes but still the cost doesn't justify the end result.

How on earth is someone able to set up an e-commerce website for a meager sum of Rs 1600?

2825,"[SERIOUS] Why you shouldn't let the younger generation take up the CA course.I was just 18 when my brother asked me to sign up for the Chartered Accountancy course. Having cleared the exams in his first attempt, he was sure  that it would be a cakewalk for me. Its been more than 5 years since and I still have a year to go at least. A ""normal"" duration of this course is 4.5-5 years. These 5 years of mine were spent waking up at obscene hours to study, running from one class to another, battling colleagues and clients, crying myself to sleep almost every night and trying not to kill myself. I was always an above average student, I had hobbies and interests, I made people laugh. But I have changed thanks to the pathetic checking system of ICAI. I am a shell of my former self.

After numerous attempts I finally cleared my Intermediate level but I was yet to be happy with my results. That's because I felt my result was the beginning of a new vicious cycle of May-November. I see my classmates in various fields landing jobs, enjoying their lives and every time they meet me they have only one exclamation on their lips. ""Tera ab tak kaise nahi hua!?"". The first couple of times I failed my well wishers asked me not to waste my time. So I stopped reading. I stopped dancing. I stopped writing. I stopped watching tv/movies. I thought my sacrifice would make me pass. But it didn't. I just went deeper and deeper into depression. I started fantasizing about killing myself. I was ashamed of making my parents sad. I was just a young child who had hopes and dreams for a better life for my family.

I don't know if I will be able to clear my finals. I don't have the same energy level as when I had started the course. All the time I just pray to the gods to let me be happy. I am not sure if the prayers are working. But I am eternally grateful to the students and protesters who are coming out everyday to protests against the mess ICAI has created of our lives. I shouldn't be ashamed of my failures, but ICAI should be. I shouldn't blame myself for their mistakes, but ICAI should be. I shouldn't be blamed for being incompetent, but ICAI should be. And everytime a student discourages someone to join CA, ICAI should hang their head in shame because they fucked up big time.",1569463380.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,94,218

2913,"“India is not, as people keep calling it, an underdeveloped country, but rather, in the context of its history and cultural heritage, a highly developed one in an advanced state of decay.”*At the outset, I would like to state that this is not an essay that is critical of India or its people in any way. I am merely stating what I have observed and what I have concluded based on these observations. For this is the unvarnished truth. And India cannot palate the truth.*

My personal example on the reluctance to work hard: it is not just that, we lack ethics and morals too.

I know I am going to ruffle a few feathers as there are a lot of people from the US here. I am a grad student in the US(working towards my Ph.D), and most of friends here in the US are working in IT related jobs. What is worrying is that most of he these people got the jobs through consultants, who fake everything thing - from fake resumes to even fake phone interviews. I mean these are 22-23 YO with an experience of 8 years. I agree that the companies don't care much about contracts jobs, but the people who work should have a sense of responsibility. 80% of my undergrad friends are working in this manner. Their defence is that 'we spend so much money on education, it is only fair to earn and this is the easiest way we can earn good money.""

I never intrude into others' personal decisions, but this is really bothering me. We buy the newest Japanese and Germany cars in a flash, yet pirate songs and movies. We bitch about the state of politics, yet we behave the same way.. even worse in some cases that public servants.

We lack even the basic of ethics, we litter everywhere, drive like lunatics(we can't even give way to ambulances) and are pretty inconsiderate of others overall. More than my disdain for politics, I am pretty annoyed by the behavior normal people.

I am not saying that I am a perfect person, at least I am being honest to myself and even though I am being paid peanuts and under a lot of pressure from my parents, I am enjoying my student life. I am just sad that many people don't have and share good values. 

The Indian brain, is a phrase I have been hearing since I was a kid. Having been a PhD candidate, and seeing how India's best and brightest compared to the world's was an eye-opener for me. Sure my fellow Indians too won best paper awards and fellowships, but the average of originality & creativity was far higher in some of our Western counterparts.

The difference becomes even more stark, when one compares the contributions and achievements of Ashkenazi Jews (American or Israeli) to those of Indians. A persecuted minority of a few millions have contributed many orders more when compared to India's privileged academic contributors- say Tamil Brahmins. Of course it is worse when compared to Indians as a whole. What is striking is that the difference holds true even when comparing in a different field like business/ finance and contrasting with Gujrati/ Marwaris.

I am not exactly a self-hating Indian, and am moderately proud of Indian achievement when compared to some of our neighbors. But that is where it unfortunately ends.

I recently moved southwards in the Bay Area- from Palo Alto/ Mountain View to Santa Clara/ San Jose. I dropped out of my PhD and now run a moderately successful startup with some burn rate, and wanted to save some dough as we are in the process of raising money. And my new residence[1] almost wants me to start hating Indians. The Indian food is far better here, but most Indians seem to be of the variety you describe- consultancy or menial tech jobs. They are clannish, semi-dumb and almost seem to be proud of their mediocrity. FML & I can't wait to move to SF.

[1] for those who are not aware, these areas are far more Indian populated. Though I have seen seen something similar when I visited a friend in New Jersey.


Socrates, the father of Western thought, often spoke of a concept called Thumos. Thumos was very much a Greek concept. An abstract concept that held many meanings and translations. However, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, ironic then, that I started this essay about the decline of ‘Indian civilization’ with a concept borrowed from the West. This is not to show that Indian philosophy has not reached the high levels of thought to have such a concept, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it. Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, that lies the seed of our destruction. How many times have you heard your elders say – “Indian culture is the best. Anything associated with the West is bad!”. I hear it all the time. It is a constant din in our ears. Anything associated with the West is decadent and immoral and inferior. And Indian culture is superior to every other culture, past, present and future. Well then, superior in exactly what manner?? Few, if any, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all? Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, “How many of the concepts, ideas, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again. The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past. And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our universities, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is, miles ahead of the decadent and corrupt influences of the West. It is not. This assertion is nothing but an inferiority complex. And an aversion to the truth.

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization, and a highly cultured one at that. But we were, and not are. What we are now is a mish mash of cultures that does not know where it is headed.

How did we then fall so low? How did we, we who had reached highs that even now are only dreamt of, fall to the very depths from where these highs are unimaginable? It is tempting to blame the West, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force. The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, a small insignificant island, and its vast territorial holdings in every corner of this planet. The dominant empire today is the USA. This empire is a little different. For its strength stems from its culture. Right from Hollywood, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, all empires must fall. The Roman empire fell when the discipline of its legions eroded. The British empire fell when its trade links could no longer be kept captive to serve them alone. The cultural empire of the USA is ripe to fall even as I write this. And the Indian empire has already fallen. A thousand years ago India was the USA of the age. Not any more. Today this cultural empire has eroded until all we have left is a kind of cultural hubris. And hubris, as we all know, is a fine quality. Often found in those who perish from it.

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, we have neither the openness to new ideas, nor the will to work hard. Take for example the resistance to ‘Westernization’. Does it not speak of a reluctance to embrace new ideas and concepts? This hardening of opinions and closing of minds is prevalent not only in resisting outside influences and ‘preserving Indian culture’, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

**A far more dangerous symptom however, is our instinctive reluctance to work hard for what we want. Our instinctive impulse to take a shortcut. Our instinctive reflex to take the easy road. Here I come back to the opening statement of this essay. “The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization”. The tough road is often a tedious path. And in India, this road is often avoided in favour of the easy. Jugaad. It is nothing but a shortcut. And we as a nation, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is the short cut. It is the easy path. And it shall lead us to barbarism. It is not an individual failing on the part of Indians. I will not blame any one person for this. It is a failing of our society. Indeed, it is a historical inevitability.**

Historical inevitability? Yes, our decline was inevitable. Every great civilization has declined when its culture of openness is replaced by closed minds and an aversion to questions. Look at Islam a thousand year ago and today. If at all anyone dares to interpret the quoran any way other than the accepted dogma, he is immediately met with a fatwa calling for his beheading. Western civilization has flourished and prospered precisely because it has cast off the yoke that is the Catholic church and allowed free thought. This freedom of thought does remain in India, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, it is not difficult to see how every rise is followed by a fall. As I have already stated, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, while the easy path comes spontaneously. Every civilization at some point, will abandon the long tough road, to take the short cut. And when a society starts taking shortcuts, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, for a long, long time. Is there nothing that can be done? I do not know. The only thing that can be done is the administration of a shock treatment. A shock treatment that so drastically affects us that we will be forced to change for the better. The Black Death in the 14th century jolted Europe and gave rise to the Renaissance, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**",1569416891.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,0,1

https://preview.redd.it/f8n1ru0ueso31.jpg?width=422&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=531505cfe205f3324f49ba805b5aafda0fb62c9b

All of us face so many issues in our cities. Be it congestion, ""crater like"" potholes on our roads, mismanaged traffic, unreliable public transportation and I can just go on and on. While our cities breathe, they emit a lot of valuable data that most of the time goes unnoticed and to waste.

Being a data scientist, I can see what this data could do to mitigate all the issues listed above but unfortunately this data never reaches the people who can innovate and build solutions around it.

My startup is building an open source data exchange platform with a focus on high velocity or real-time data for smart cities. Our aim is to bring public entities closer to data innovators and application developers. This would enable easy access to real-time datasets like public bus location, air quality and much more in the future.

Getting real-time bus location data from any supported city is as easy as

    from mesh_gtfsr.mesh import MeshGTFSR
    
    def main():
      m = MeshGTFSR()
    
      feed = m.subscribe([
        '/in/delhi'
      ])
      
      # You get feed in 'f'
      # and geospace in 'g
      for f, g in feed:
        print('Geospace: ' + g)
        print('Feed: ' + str(f)) 
    
    if ""__main__"" == __name__:
      main()

You can learn more about the platform on our github page: [https://github.com/pravahio/go-mesh](https://github.com/pravahio/go-mesh)

If you resonate with the idea, let's chat and see how we can collaborate.

Platform and the data are completely free. Give it a try and do let me know your feedback. I would be happy to incorporate you suggestions.

If you are feeling too excited about the platform, we are looking for contributors. Send me a message and let's talk.

*Future Datasets: More public buses data from other cities, air quality and weather data, Train location data stream*.

3012,"Guide for landing a decent job from a Tier 3 Engineering college as a 'below average' studentI see a lot of 'average' or even 'above average' students cribbing on randia and randian_academia!

This is going to be a long one.

This post was mainly regarding how can one land a decent job. In my opinion there are two things

1. **Deal breakers**
2. **Match makers**

You need to ensure that there are many **match makers** and next to none **deal breakers**

**Deal breakers** dont help you get a good job but they surely reduce or nullify your chances of getting a good one!

**Match makers** are things that help you get closer to that dream job.

1. A good CGPA won't help you get a good job but with a bad CGPA you will definitely end up losing quite a few good ones. You need to maintain a above average CGPA. Period. CGPA matters for freshers! You need to have a really really reasons to compensate for a bad CGPA - which most of us 'average' students don't have. So please try to maintain a high CGPA.**CGPA is a deal breaker** 

2. It is better to not have any backlogs, Consistently getting backlogs is not a good sign. **This can be a deal breaker**

Now you need to decide what type of companies are you targetting. I will try my best to classify all companies I came across (Tier 3 college so wont be talking about BigN)

**Service based companies** (TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, LTI, TechMahindra etc)

1. Average or below average salaries

2. Work life balance to some extent

3.  You might get to work on diverse technologies!

4. You might end up sitting on bench or you might get a decent project

5. **Less opportunity to learn**


**Product based companies** (Siemens, Microsoft, Zoho, Avaya etc)

1. They pay much better than service based companies

2. Fast adaptation to 'buzzwords'

3. They usually have classy offices!

4. **Good opportunity to learn** (Unless you are working for some company working on IP or shit)

5. Work life balance can be shit!

6. Deep pyramidical hierarchy where your fate is dependent on the manager you get!

**Startups** (PhonePe, Espressif, etc)

1. Some startups pay less, Some startups which have funding pour money like no tomorrow! (Salary is directly proportional to funding)

2. Project based

3. A lot to learn here

4. Hierarchy is usually flat

5. Don't expect work life balance in most startups!

6. Work can be challenging

7. Can get stressful if you have to be a jack of all trades!

**Fintech** (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, HSBC, Credit Suisse, UBS etc)

1. These companies have slow adapation to new technologies and buzzwords (They love Java)

2. It can be a monotonous job

3. Classy offices

4. Best brand names

5. They usually have their own production house and rarely depend on vendors (Correct me if I am wrong)

6. Dont expect work life balance

7. Usually they pay really well!

Remember one thing, Whenever a company says that 'They have **no criteria**, then this is the biggest criteria'. They usually have a poor selection ratio and a absymally high number of rounds!

This is my case.

Background (Will probably end up getting doxxed but I dont care) -

1. Repeated one year after 12th
2. Scored lesser in Jee Mains in second attempt.
3. Did not appear for Jee Advanced in second attempt due to some reasons!
4. Scored absymally low in 12th in first attempt
5. Scored slightly higher in 12th second attempt!

This was my life before till 12th!

Then I had to setlle with a Tier 3 (Non IIT, Non NIT) college. Non CSE branch.

Parents/Relatives taunted me endlessly.

Forunately I had a few good friends and a caring girlfriend for some moral support too!

My college has way too  strict, It was more like a school. They expected attendance tending to 100%.

My first year went completely in attending college. I did not study anything else except academics.

Then came second year, Now we got started with subjects of core branch. Here is where I picked up some 'good habits' which ended up helping me later which eventually helped me land this job in one of the investment banks I have mentioned above ;)

We haven't discussed any **match makers** yet!

These  **match makers** will be derived from Y.V.Hari's book **21 Lessons for the 21st Century**. He calls them the **4 C's**

1. Creativity

2. Critical Thinking

3. Collaboration

4. Communication

**Good communication skill**

You must know how to talk properly to people, Have a rich vocabulary, Be confident when speaking in front of a crowd, Don't stutter under pressure. This is really important. You might be a really good candidate but bad communication skills can end up costing you a really good job!

**Creativity**

You should be able to come up with out of the box ways to do things! You should be able to analyze a given situation and propose an efficient solution to that problem. This quality cannot be developed consciously and knowingly in a short amount of time!

**Collaboration**

You should know how to work in a team, Please invest some time in making one or two good Group projects! If possible then spend a month or two organizing those shitty college fests, Volunteer for a pet shelter, Go on a social work cleaning drive etc! Don't do this to brag on your resume, This probably isn't going to help you crack that 1.6 LPM deal, But you will surely learn how to deal with people, How to network! 

**Study from standard textbooks**

Please try to refer to as many 'reference books' as you can. Yes, You can easily score 9.5+ pointer by studying from a shitty local author's book written for your university syllabus. But studying from standard textbooks is going to take you a long way!

We have over 40 subjects in this Engineering degree, You need to learn **how to learn**, And studying from good books teaches you that. You will learn how to dissect a topic and remember it forever!

**Choose your friend circle very carefully**

You are the average of five people you spend most of your time with. So better spend time with people who are sharing similar interest, Who are hardworking and focused. Its fine to get stoned once a while, But don't make it a habit. Try to spend time with people who are on average better than you!

Now let us talk about specific skills, this is what I have done, There must be many other better ways of doing things!

**Quantitative Aptitude** - Arun Sharma (Spent 1-2 full days on Indiabix and geeksforgeeks then started solving Arun Sharma **thrice a week**)

**Verbal** - Read as much as you can! I read 'Word Power Made Easy' side by side

**Logical reasoning** - Practice from wherever you can! Source hardly matters, Just be sure that you are solving questions that are challenging you.

**Core CS Subjects** (I am a non CSE student) (Being shit at core cse subjects is a **deal breaker**)

I personally chose standard textbooks, You can study from NPTEL videos or from other GATE preparation Youtube channels if you are more of a visual learner. 

OS - Galvin, Stallings

DBMS - Korth

Discrete Maths - Rosen

Computer Networks - Ross

As you do theory, Make it a point to solve **good GATE questions** to ensure that you have understood concepts properly

**Data Structures / Algorithms** (Being good at solving problems using DSA is a **match maker**)

1. If you are a complete beginner then you can start with **MyCodeSchool** Youtube Channel then move on to **Abdul Bari**, **Tushar Roy**, **iDeserve** etc.

2. Regularly solve questions on any one of these sites - LeetCode/HackerRank/HackerEarth/Codechef. **attend contests**, Have a small special interest group in your college where you discuss problems which you saw in contest! There are no excuses here.

3. Try to solve as many questions as you can on ProjectEuler, 

4. If you are done preparing basic DSA and have attended a decent number of contests then just before your placement session starts you can practice on **interviewbit**, Solve from Gayle Laakman's **CTCL**

**Projects** (Having good projects on your resume is a **match maker**)

1. Please have good projects on your resume! 
 
2. Projects on which you actually had to sweat and which solved a small problem or two!

3.  You must be able to discuss these projects in depth

4. Once you start making slightly complex software projects then have a look at **system design** videos on youtube. **System design** is something that must be learnt practically, **Just watching those videos like a dummy is not going to help.** The interviewer is most probably going to be much more experienced than you and it will take it hardly few minutes to pull your pants down if you all you do is churn up few buzzwords in front of him when he asks you some System Design questions. (Being good at System design is a **match maker**)

5. Learn version control, Its handy.

6. You dont need to jerk around buzzwords like ML AI Blockchain lavda lassan just for the sake of it, Being strong with basics is **more than enough** even for top companies.


Try to be a **likeable person** whom everyone prefers to have around! If you are not fun to be with, If you are arrogant and have a bad attitude then chances are you are going to kicked out sometime or later in a further round of the process!

After all, remember one thing, **Be kind, For everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle, Be empathetic**, help others! Spend some time trying to answer questions asked by others on Forums, Spend time reviewing code written by others, Get your own code reviewed. Have fun, Enjoy!

So, After closely watching recent news on RBI putting restrictions on PMC bank, I am little worried about my life savings in my own bank. People are worried that they gonna lose their hard earned money. I am concerned as well because as per banking norms, if a bank collapsed, you are  insured for a sum of  only 1 lac rupees, doesn't matter if you lost crores in the event. 

Last year I put my life savings on the fixed deposit in Yes bank(Because they offer highest interest rate of 7.85%) . However, recent news about the yes bank suggest a huge bad loans cover up and sharp decline in share price. Moreover, MD of yes bank is offering paytm a controlling share of the bank in order to raise money. These events are seriously alarming. So, I need a suggestion about what should i do with money?. Should i just withdraw it and keep it in more safer bank like HDFC or SBI or should i just let it be there. Anyone experience in this please help.",1569413183.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,6,11

Right from the boat scene, the dialogue delivery looks completely fake, then his sidekick is annoying as hell, unprofessional, forcing humor and creepy with a female coworker, I refuse to believe that people who do this kind of work behave like such imbeciles.

Manoj Vajpayee left an important task in between to go to his daughter's school, when got to know that the terrorists escaped, there still wasn't no urgency in his actions, he was still bullshitting with the principal and walking down the school hall like he is going to his baraat. For fuck's sake, 3 terrorists escaped from the handover you were supposed to supervise and here you are chit chatting with your daughter? 

Then the ex-NSG, I am pretty sure that a guy who has played Call of Duty can perform much better with a gun than that fool, he can neither move nor shoot, and the use of hands to give directions looks totally unnecessary and forced. It looked like he was shitting his pants all the while, at least the girl was honest and showed like she was scared to confront those 3 men.

And then the negotiations with the injured terrorist, my god, made absolutely no sense. They could have told him that if they want him dead then they can happily wait for him to bleed to his death, and since they don't want to kill him, he can throw his rifle out, and walk out with his hands over his head. He had indicated in the beginning that he had no interest in confronting them and he was just scared for his life. There was absolutely no reason to pull that stunt.

3056,"Do people get socially / personally alienated because they're not interested / scared of pets?Over the past few months (and over the course of the last couple of years) I have noticed that an not having an overwhelming affection for dogs, cats and all assorted pets is a rather significant factor in maintaining relations with friends and family, dealbreakers when it comes to dating and possibly relations too. 

[ *""i'm a mother / father of 2 doggos""* ; *""if there's a doggo in your pic i'm dating you and stealing that good boi""* ; **the evergreen classic** *""doggos over humans any day...""* ; *""if my cat likes you, only then you have my approval...""* ; the deluge of appreciation tweets & posts on Instagram / Facebook; now the rise in posts in this very sub over the past week and many, many more...]

Dating apps have women and men displaying overwhelming affection for their pets. I've personally been unmatched and (digitally) broken contact with on a couple of occasions because I straight up admitted that i'm not too keen about pets (specifically dogs). 

[that i'm kinda scared of dogs in general due to a childhood mishap with a pet dog is a whole other issue altogether - growing up I've managed to control my fear/worry and while I don't exactly start screaming when in close proximity to a dog, I do look visibly panicked]

i'm not exaggerating when I say a potential marriage alliance was completely nipped in the bud because of the fact that she had a tattoo of her pet dog and I clearly admitted that i'm not a fan of having a pet / pets in the future. My entire existence as a human being and all my joys and sorrows, education, academics, work experience, sporting and personal achievements were instantly invalidated in a flash - because of this viewpoint.

while I clearly and obviously do not have an issue with folks having pets at their homes and the visible rise of pet friendly public spaces. cafes & restaurants - any attempts at trying to meet at non pet presence(d??) places is met with a lot of derision and straight up hostility. 

I understand that folks with pets treat them as nothing short of family members - but their decision to stay away from actual human beings; avoid and have a low opinion of those who are averse to pets - is rather confusing and if I may admit to it - a bit hurtful as well. I've missed out on a couple of social & personal relations because of this and I really do think it rankles.

3066,"My experience landing a decent job from a Tier 3 Engineering college as a average studentI see a lot of 'average' or even 'above average' students cribbing on randia and randian_academia!

This is going to be a long one.

This post was mainly regarding how can one land a decent job. In my opinion there are two things

1. **Deal breakers**
2. **Match makers**

You need to ensure that there are many **match makers** and next to none **deal breakers**

**Deal breakers** dont help you get a good job but they surely reduce or nullify your chances of getting a good one!

**Match makers** are things that help you get closer to that dream job.

1. A good CGPA won't help you get a good job but with a bad CGPA you will definitely end up losing quite a few good ones. You need to maintain a above average CGPA. Period. CGPA matters for freshers! You need to have a really really reasons to compensate for a bad CGPA - which most of us 'average' students don't have. So please try to maintain a high CGPA.**CGPA is a deal breaker** 

2. It is better to not have any backlogs, Consistently getting backlogs is not a good sign. **This can be a deal breaker**

Now you need to decide what type of companies are you targetting. I will try my best to classify all companies I came across (Tier 3 college so wont be talking about BigN)

**Service based companies** (TCS, Accenture, Cognizant, LTI, TechMahindra etc)

1. Average or below average salaries

2. Work life balance to some extent

3.  You might get to work on diverse technologies!

4. You might end up sitting on bench or you might get a decent project

5. **Less opportunity to learn**


**Product based companies** (Siemens, Microsoft, Zoho, Avaya etc)

1. They pay much better than service based companies

2. Fast adaptation to 'buzzwords'

3. They usually have classy offices!

4. **Good opportunity to learn** (Unless you are working for some company working on IP or shit)

5. Work life balance can be shit!

6. Deep pyramidical hierarchy where your fate is dependent on the manager you get!

**Startups** (PhonePe, Espressif, etc)

1. Some startups pay less, Some startups which have funding pour money like no tomorrow! (Salary is directly proportional to funding)

2. Project based

3. A lot to learn here

4. Hierarchy is usually flat

5. Don't expect work life balance in most startups!

6. Work can be challenging

7. Can get stressful if you have to be a jack of all trades!

**Fintech** (Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan, HSBC, Credit Suisse, UBS etc)

1. These companies have slow adapation to new technologies and buzzwords (They love Java)

2. It can be a monotonous job

3. Classy offices

4. Best brand names

5. They usually have their own production house and rarely depend on vendors (Correct me if I am wrong)

6. Dont expect work life balance

7. Usually they pay really well!

Remember one thing, Whenever a company says that 'They have **no criteria**, then this is the biggest criteria'. They usually have a poor selection ratio and a absymally high number of rounds!

This is my case.

Background (Will probably end up getting doxxed but I dont care) -

1. Repeated one year after 12th
2. Scored lesser in Jee Mains in second attempt.
3. Did not appear for Jee Advanced in second attempt due to some reasons!
4. Scored absymally low in 12th in first attempt
5. Scored slightly higher in 12th second attempt!

This was my life before till 12th!

Then I had to setlle with a Tier 3 (Non IIT, Non NIT) college. Non CSE branch.

Parents/Relatives taunted me endlessly.

Forunately I had a few good friends and a caring girlfriend for some moral support too!

My college has way too  strict, It was more like a school. They expected attendance tending to 100%.

My first year went completely in attending college. I did not study anything else except academics.

Then came second year, Now we got started with subjects of core branch. Here is where I picked up some 'good habits' which ended up helping me later which eventually helped me land this job in one of the investment banks I have mentioned above ;)

We haven't discussed any **match makers** yet!

These  **match makers** will be derived from Y.V.Hari's book **21 Lessons for the 21st Century**. He calls them the **4 C's**

1. Creativity

2. Critical Thinking

3. Collaboration

4. Communication

**Good communication skill**

You must know how to talk properly to people, Have a rich vocabulary, Be confident when speaking in front of a crowd, Don't stutter under pressure. This is really important. You might be a really good candidate but bad communication skills can end up costing you a really good job!

**Creativity**

You should be able to come up with out of the box ways to do things! You should be able to analyze a given situation and propose an efficient solution to that problem. This quality cannot be developed consciously and knowingly in a short amount of time!

**Collaboration**

You should know how to work in a team, Please invest some time in making one or two good Group projects! If possible then spend a month or two organizing those shitty college fests, Volunteer for a pet shelter, Go on a social work cleaning drive etc! Don't do this to brag on your resume, This probably isn't going to help you crack that 1.6 LPM deal, But you will surely learn how to deal with people, How to network! 

**Study from standard textbooks**

Please try to refer to as many 'reference books' as you can. Yes, You can easily score 9.5+ pointer by studying from a shitty local author's book written for your university syllabus. But studying from standard textbooks is going to take you a long way!

We have over 40 subjects in this Engineering degree, You need to learn **how to learn**, And studying from good books teaches you that. You will learn how to dissect a topic and remember it forever!

**Choose your friend circle very carefully**

You are the average of five people you spend most of your time with. So better spend time with people who are sharing similar interest, Who are hardworking and focused. Its fine to get stoned once a while, But don't make it a habit. Try to spend time with people who are on average better than you!

Now let us talk about specific skills, this is what I have done, There must be many other better ways of doing things!

**Quantitative Aptitude** - Arun Sharma (Spent 1-2 full days on Indiabix and geeksforgeeks then started solving Arun Sharma **thrice a week**)

**Verbal** - Read as much as you can! I read 'Word Power Made Easy' side by side

**Logical reasoning** - Practice from wherever you can! Source hardly matters, Just be sure that you are solving questions that are challenging you.

**Core CS Subjects** (I am a non CSE student) (Being shit at core cse subjects is a **deal breaker**)

I personally chose standard textbooks, You can study from NPTEL videos or from other GATE preparation Youtube channels if you are more of a visual learner. 

OS - Galvin, Stallings

DBMS - Korth

Discrete Maths - Rosen

Computer Networks - Ross

As you do theory, Make it a point to solve **good GATE questions** to ensure that you have understood concepts properly

**Data Structures / Algorithms** (Being good at solving problems using DSA is a **match maker**)

1. If you are a complete beginner then you can start with **MyCodeSchool** Youtube Channel then move on to **Abdul Bari**, **Tushar Roy**, **iDeserve** etc.

2. Regularly solve questions on any one of these sites - LeetCode/HackerRank/HackerEarth/Codechef. **attend contests**, Have a small special interest group in your college where you discuss problems which you saw in contest! There are no excuses here.

3. Try to solve as many questions as you can on ProjectEuler, 

4. If you are done preparing basic DSA and have attended a decent number of contests then just before your placement session starts you can practice on **interviewbit**, Solve from Gayle Laakman's **CTCL**

**Projects** (Having good projects on your resume is a **match maker**)

1. Please have good projects on your resume! 
 
2. Projects on which you actually had to sweat and which solved a small problem or two!

3.  You must be able to discuss these projects in depth

4. Once you start making slightly complex software projects then have a look at **system design** videos on youtube. **System design** is something that must be learnt practically, **Just watching those videos like a dummy is not going to help.** The interviewer is most probably going to be much more experienced than you and it will take it hardly few minutes to pull your pants down if you all you do is churn up few buzzwords in front of him when he asks you some System Design questions. (Being good at System design is a **match maker**)

5. Learn version control, Its handy.

6. You dont need to jerk around buzzwords like ML AI Blockchain lavda lassan just for the sake of it, Being strong with basics is **more than enough** even for top companies.


Try to be a **likeable person** whom everyone prefers to have around! If you are not fun to be with, If you are arrogant and have a bad attitude then chances are you are going to kicked out sometime or later in a further round of the process!

After all, remember one thing, **Be kind, For everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle, Be empathetic**, help others! Spend some time trying to answer questions asked by others on Forums, Spend time reviewing code written by others, Get your own code reviewed. Have fun, Enjoy!

He has a lot of cousins and one of his elder cousin's \[36\] wedding was recently fixed. We found out that the girl is probably 16 or 17. We raised objections, especially in front of his parents and said that this was not okay. But they kept justifying it by saying that ""gaon mein aisa hi hota hai"", ""unki majboori hai kyunki koi aur ladki mil hi nahi rahi"" etc etc. We made it clear though that we wouldn't attend if the girl was underage.

Yesterday, my husband was told that the girl turned 18 on 17th of September by his Tauji. But we both have our doubts since he isn't a very honest man and we got different information earlier. Now my husband is being pressurized to attend the wedding which is in November. I have a very strong gut feeling that this is all wrong and we should probably report it to concerned authorities. My husband isn't interested in filing an FIR, but is willing to report to an institution like NCW (National commission for women) - what should we do? Really confused.

Transcript(emphasis mine): 

I rise to highlight some of the problems that have arisen after the decision to demonetise Rs500 and Rs1000 currency notes.

Prime minister has been arguing that this is the way to curb black money, to prevent growth of forfeited currency notes and also to help in control of terrorist finance activity.

I do not disagree with these objectives. But what I do want to point out is that in the process of demonetisation, monumental mismanagement has been undertaken [applause] about which there is no opinions in the country as a whole.

Even those who say that this measure will do harm or will cause distress in the short term but be in the interest of the country in the long-run, I am reminded of what John Keynes said once: In the long run, all of us are dead.

And therefore it is important to take note of the grievances of the people, the ordinary people who have suffered as a result of this imposition on the country overnight by the prime minister.

And I say so with all responsibility, that the outcome… we do not know what will be final outcome. Prime minister has said that we should wait for 50 days. Well, 50 days is a short period, but for those who are poor and deprived section of the community, even 50 days torture can bring about disastrous effect. And that’s why about 60 to 65 people have lost their lives. Maybe more.

**And what is more is, what has been done can weaken and erode our people’s confidence in the currency system and in the banking system. One, I would like to know from the prime minister, the names of any countries he may think of where people have deposited their money in the banks but they are not allowed to withdraw their money.  This alone, I think, is enough to condemn what has been done in the name of [inaudible].**

And sir, I would further like to point out that in my opinion, this scheme of (de)monetisation, the way it has been implemented will hurt agricultural growth in our country, will hurt small industry, will hurt all those people who are in the informal sectors of the economy. **And my own feeling is that the national income, i.e. the GDP of the country, can decline by about two percentage points as a result of what has been done. This is an underestimate, not an overestimate.**

Therefore, I feel that the prime minister must come with some construction proposal: How we can implement this scheme and at the same time, prevent this distress that is being caused to the common people?

It is no good that every day the banking system comes with modification of the rules, the conditions under which people can withdraw money. That reflects very poorly on the prime minister’s office, on the finance minister’s office and on the Reserve Bank of India. I am very sorry that the Reserve Bank of India has been exposed to this sort of criticism, which I think is fully justified.

I, therefore, would not like to say much more than this. I urge upon the prime minister to find practical, pragmatic ways and means to relieve the distress of the people who happen to be a great majority of our people.

After all, 90% of our people work in the informal sector, 55% of our workers in agriculture are feeling distressed. The cooperative banking system, which serves a large number of people in the rural areas, is non-functional. It has been prevented from handling [inaudible].

So, all these measures convince me that the way this scheme has been implemented is a monumental management failure and in fact, it is a case of organised loot and legalised plunder [inaudible].

With these words, sir, I conclude. It is not my intention to pick holes in what one side does, or another side does. But I sincerely hope that the prime minister will, even at this late hour, will help us to find practical, pragmatic ways and means to provide relief to the suffering people of this country.

Thank you.",1569423843.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,3,70

Learn elementary physics on the side and I still have a couple of hours left everyday before I hit the sack. Not that I am complaining. But I would like to put those few hours to productive use. So I've decided to teach General programming concepts and the python programming language specifically. I have been coding for close to 15 years. Worked in San Francisco for a few years. Used python, Golang, rust and Haskell professionally. Dabbled with Godot, C# and Racket on my own free time.

So if you're interested to learn python or programming in general and you're finding it hard to learn by yourself or stay motivated, then DM me. If we could work out the timings, I'd be willing to help you learn. Or if you simply have some questions about programming, hit me up. I'm not interested in making any money. Just want to use my time doing something useful. I speak multiple languages, but I prefer to teach in English. If you can converse in English, that's good enough.

Cheers and have a wonderful evening.

EDIT 1:

Thank you kind stranger for the silver. I don’t know who you are but your gesture is sincerely appreciated. 

And thank you guys for the overwhelming responses on this thread and the numerous DMs I’ve received. I have never received as many DMs as I have in the past few hours. This blew up in a good way. I wasn’t expecting it to generate so much interest. I was genuinely expecting only a few responses. I would teach you all if I could. But understandably I can only allocate a few hours to this everyday. I will try to respond to everyone, but I don’t think I can teach everyone right away. 

It’s going to take awhile to get through all of you. So if you don’t hear from me right away, please note that you are not being ignored. I just need some time to get to you.

Cheers and have a wonderful day.


EDIT 2: 

Thanks for the gold stranger. Much appreciated. I have never received gold or silver before but to have both on the same post is a good feeling. Feels like I struck a chord with the Reddit/r/India community. 

As mentioned in my previous edit, the responses have been pleasantly overwhelming. Like I said, I would have liked to teach you all but that seems impossible unless I organize a system that allows me to cater to all of you. 

I’ve decided to spend some time thinking about how I can increase my throughput so I can teach as many people as possible. There are a few redditors in the comments who have volunteered to teach their programming skills. I will see if I can rope them in as well. 

You will be hearing from me soon. In the mean time I’m going to try and respond to as many comments, chats and DMs to update them of my plans. 

Cheers and have a wonderful day.",1569455406.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,55,153

3105,"TIL Harvard University sacked Subramanian Swamy in 2011 for hate speechhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16081751

I am just surprised no one brings this up. I've never paid attention to this man before I came to r/india where many people seem to admire him for being a Harvard Alumni and for being a super economist who taught courses there. Yet, no one brought it up that he was sacked for hate speech. Probably because its not a big deal getting fired from Harvard, since it is known sickular establishment, but still, at least don't associate his greatness with Harvard in an attempt to give him more izzat than he deserves. This is what Harvard feels about Mr. Swamy - 

> Harvard University said Mr Swamy's views were ""reprehensible"". The MP holds a doctorate in economics from the university.

> The Faculty of Arts and Sciences voted with an ""overwhelming majority"" to remove the courses taught by Mr Swamy.

> She said Harvard had a moral responsibility not to affiliate itself with anyone who expressed hatred towards a minority group.

> ""There is a distinction between unpopular and unwelcome political views.""

> Earlier in July, more than 400 students had signed a petition demanding Mr Swamy's removal after the university had decided to stand by him.

he openly talks about restricting voting rights to minorities and other anti muslm stuff. One of the reasons why he is popular amongst the online masses is because of these views. Fanaticism if welded properly, is seen as strength in India, not as cause for untouchability.

Swamy's allegiance to the hindu right is no secret. Although he says much that makes sense, he also says things like having separate voter identification cards for Muslims. He rightly says the law should be the same for everyone, but soon he contradicts himself in calling for restriction of rights of muslims.

He is free to hold those opinions, just as an educational institution is free to rebuke him for that. 

Merely combining wit with hate is not reason enough to be correct. Sadly, for the masses who can't see through his veneer of wit are taken in by it and believe that his views are legitimate. He may be a Harvard alumni, but it escapes me how someone who has been to the world's only country built on morality can come back and hold such views. #fail

""...we shall have to put all the minority communities as well as the provinces at their ease…To promote national unity we shall have to develop our lingua franca and a common script. So far as our Lingua Franca is concerned, I am inclined to think that the distinction between Hindi and Urdu is an artificial one. The most natural Lingua Franca would be a mixture of the two, such as is spoken in daily life in large portions of the country; and this common language may be written in either of the two scripts, Nagari or Urdu… At the same time, I am inclined to think that the ultimate solution would be the adoption of a script that would bring us into line with the rest of the world. Perhaps, some of our countrymen will gape with horror when they hear of the adoption of the Roman script, but I would beg them to consider this problem from the scientific and historical point of view… I confess that there was a time when I felt that it would be anti-national to adopt a foreign script. But my visit to Turkey in 1934 was responsible for converting me. I then realised for the first time what a great advantage it was to have the same script as the rest of the world.""

Savarkars retort:

""Desh Gaurav Subhas Babu improving upon the situation beats even Panditji’s ingenuity hollow by proposing from the Presidential chair of the Indian National Congress that Roman Script would suit India as the best National Script. That is how the Congress ideology approaches things National! Roman script to be the National Script of India! How imminently practicable, to say the least! Your Basumati, Ananda Bazar Patrika and all Bengali papers to appear every day in Roman script!

It is true as Subhas Babu says that Kemal Pasha abolished the Arabian Script as unsuited to print and took to Roman script. But this fact has a lesson for our Mahommedan zealots who want the Urdu script, in this very Arabian style, to thrust even on the Hindus as an up-to-date National Script, and it has no connection with the Hindus. Kemal Pasha took to the Roman script because the Turks had nothing better of their own to fall back upon. The Andamanese pick up Kauris and make a necklace of them, but is that the reason why the Kuber also should do the same? We Hindus should rather call upon Arabia and Europe to adopt the Nagari Script and Hindi language; such a proposal should not sound very impracticable to such inveterate optimists at any rate who seriously advance it as a very practical proposal to make Urdu the National language of the Marathas and to expect all our Arya Samaj Gurukuls to study the Vedas in Roman script?”

Why this post?

1. Netaji was far more hardline secular than Gandhi and Nehru

2. Netaji was far more hardline socialist than either gandhi or nehru.

A lot of sanghi sites are spreading fake news about netaji showing him as a sangh bhakt. 

They try to prove that sangh and subhash were on the same page in all cases. 

For example the following is a post from such a sanghi site:

""No one could ever fathom that Subhash Chandra Bose from childhood was a General in the army of mysticism and Shakta Sadhana. He surmounted mean and petty things in life ever seeking the magnificent and the majestic. He was a miraculous genius seeking seclusion notwithstanding war front, politics or jail for his yogic meditation and Sadhana. He gave up a life of comfort and high position to follow a life of asceticism and mysticism. There dwelt a strong desire deep within his soul which derived him from the seen to the unseen, to the philosophy and to the divine. He contemplated a theory of creation of the Universe from consciousness. He was always interested in reading the latest books and modern discoveries in science. Poetry was his heart and soul. He could recite Hindi ‘dohas’, Sanskrit ‘shlokas’ and poems in Bengali and English for hours together. His memorization was fantastic. He was an expert in dodging the Allied Intelligence. His disappearance and appearance was perennial since childhood. He chased the eternal truth and the unknown. He had implicit faith in reincarnation and Buddha’s Nirwana but unlike Buddha he believed in God. His spiritual pursuit was ceaseless. He had deep faith in the Vedas, Upanishadas, Bhagwatgita and the Bible. His chants of slokas are still famous worldwide. He believed that sorrow, suffering, fasts, and long walks purify man’s heart and mind. Weak minds see not worthy in the world and wallow in materialism. He advanced spiritually towards the divine irrespective of hardships. He emulated saints and sages and wandered afoot as a pilgrim all over India when in recluse.""

Furthermore, we are having films that blatantly betray the personality and history wrt subhash and try to paint ""gumnami baba"" as netaji, and subtly potray netaji as someone who had been close to the sangh, and in his later days become a sadhu. In spite of DNA tests with the bose family failing, the sangh keeps on pushing the narrative. Such narrative not only betrays the secular nature of netaji and pushes him as a sangh stooge.

A recent film called gumnami has been released(?) on these lines:

“They will not leave me alive. They will destroy me. Let them do what  they want. (For) 50 days, help me. The country should just help me for  50 days,” said Modi in his speech at an indoor stadium near Panjim.

""If I commit any mistake after December 30, I am ready to face any  punishment the country will give me"", said the Prime Minister. But I  promise to deliver a corruption-free India. “I promise to give you  India, as you have dreamed of after December 30, said PM Modi. He said  that he had more projects in mind to make India corruption-free;  cooperate with me for 50 days to ensure this.

“They thought if they pull my hair, I will stop and do nothing. I  will not be cowed down. I will not stop doing these things, even if you  burn me alive,” Modi said addressing a function in Panaji.

*His lips trembled and there were long pauses when, fighting back  tears, he said*, “My dear countrymen, I gave up everything...My home, my  family. I gave up everything I had for this country.”

“They thought if they pull my hair, I will stop and do nothing. I will  not be cowed down. I will not stop doing these things, even if you burn  me alive,”

 but i didn't do anything and the lady said in African accent ""That you were the one who came after and I am not going to leave this lift"" but the uncles and aunties said in hindi language ""Inka kuch ni ho sakta"" i was dumbstruck and i didn't know how to react to this statement but the thing i learned that I (Or every one) has to stand-up to this kind of racism that happens in INDIA. The thing is if we see white people in India we are glad that they came to our country but when we see Black people it's the opposite. This is the kind of mentality i want to change in myself and to fellow people.  


&#x200B;

And this thing is the one that showed me that I am not courageous enough to voice my opinion, I could have said to those uncle to stop your rambling but i didn't that's what i am ashamed off",1569404892.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,68,95

Either I am consuming too much of negative news or it is indeed the reality. I am 21 years old and browsing memes on reddit then suddenly parkouring to the news about women being raped, Kashmir, Our Government, Uneducated Barbaric Leaders, no place for a just man etc makes me really wanna leave this country but I am sure wherever I go some things will follow and being inexperienced and a deserter would not give me the tools to fight the same thing there. Running away from that place is also not an option. I don't know what I can do or what I should do, it's even hard for me to go take a bath or shit in  the morning and I also need to think about my future. I simply can't abandon everything and mettle myself to a cause , I am just a commoner and weak. I feel hopeless. Should I just shut the bad news and carry on with my life or absorb them and be depressed because I feel useless, pathetic and hopeless. Would a 16 year old in India be able to do what Greta Thunberg did but for a cause in India? I can't do it. I am so weak timid and coward. Maybe it's the way Indian movies and media have portrayed about the negatives happening in our country. Hard to find a leader that has the same morals or at least iron passion from our days of struggle for our freedom. Everyone seems to succumb to some sort of trap either into their own vices or the one set out by people. I wish women sacrificed their beauty and took steroids and got fucking jacked and learned MMA, I wish people let go some parts of their religion, I wish everyone knew their rights and fought for it,I wish people worked hard, I wish there to be more good people than bad, I wish I didn't care  but this is my country and I am going to live in it, even if I chose to desert it then someone else will live in it.",1569343569.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,2,3

3698,"How do NRIs take care of ageing parents?Question says it all. NRIs have chosen to stay abroad - most probably for the rest of their lives. AFAIK, Ageing parents can only either live in India or brought abroad to live with us.

I believe the world is too big for someone to spend their entire life in one country. I want to travel the world. I've lived in two countries (2 years and 6 years in each) since I left India. I want to move to other countries and live long enough in each country to understand the countries and then move on to another country. Sorta nomadic. But long enough to call each country home. To help with this mission, I have, in fact, decided to never have children (Childfree by Choice) so I don't have to worry about schools, children etc.,

To a third person, it appears like it's just me, my wife and the world for me to travel. But the reality is far from the truth. My parents are ageing and I really love my parents a lot (that's the ""Indian in me"" speaking). I want to be able to care of them. I want to treat them like my kids. But I know I can either travel, or I can care for my parents. I can't do both and I am torn between the two.

What do ageing parents do during the rest of their lives and until their final years?

Who cares for ageing parents during their final years if their kids are abroad?

What steps/measures do NRI folks take to make sure their parents are cared for in their later years?

https://preview.redd.it/vk8zcbb4sio31.jpg?width=389&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b81169a3f60ecc89d246db99901cf18b1024cabb

**24 September 2019:** In today's hearing before the Supreme Court in Facebook's transfer petition seeking transfer of *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* from the Madras High Court to the Supreme Court, extensive arguments were made by the parties on whether technical and complex issues involving encryption should be addressed by the judiciary.

On 23.09.2019, IFF filed its response to Facebook's transfer petition and reiterated that while it believes such problems should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government, the Supreme Court should not curtail the jurisdiction of High Courts to entertain writ petitions by ordinary Indian internet users against large multinational tech companies. Ordinary Indian internet users residing in different parts of the country should be allowed to approach their State High Courts if their fundamental rights are violated by Big Tech because most Indians do not have the resources to initiate litigation in the Supreme Court. While we believe that the prayers in *Antony Clement Rubin v. Union of India* are misguided and strongly oppose any attempts to weaken encryption, it is also important to preserve access to justice for aggrieved citizens.

During today's hearing, the bench once again inquired about the status of the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules which have been in the pipeline since December 2018. The Counsel for the Central Government clarified that the policy formulation process was underway and ""special suggestions"" were being sought to revise the Rules. However, he stated that a specific timeline for notification of the Rules could not be provided. The Bench comprising of Deepak Gupta J. and Aniruddha Bose J. noted that while misuse of technology is a serious concern, such technical and complex issues are best addressed by the executive branch.

The Counsel for the State of Tamil Nadu insisted that WhatsApp was trying to avoid complying with Indian law by stating that it does not have the technology to identify the originator of information on its platform but this was not true since Dr. Kamakoti who is a Professor at IIT Madras had provided a technical solution to enable tracing of originator. In response, Senior Advocate Mr. Kapil Sibal appearing for WhatsApp stated that another IIT Professor had disagreed with Dr. Kamakoti's proposed solution. This was a reference to the expert report by Dr. Manoj Prabhakaran from IIT Bombay that IFF had previously filed before the Madras High Court. Read more about it [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/iff-files-independent-expert-submission-before-madras-hc/).

After hearing these submissions, the Court noted that such complex issues need to be decided in consultation with technical experts and the judiciary cannot be expected to implement such changes. The Court emphasized that while policy formulation was within the domain of the executive, any policy formulated by the government is subject to judicial scrutiny to ensure that it does not undermine the right to privacy. Since the Draft Intermediaries Guidelines Rules are being actively considered by the Government, the Court adjourned the matter till 22.10.2019. It further directed the Solicitor General to file an affidavit by the Secretary of MeitY within 3 weeks about the status of the Rules and provide a definite timeline about when the process will be completed.

IFF's Executive Director, Mr. Apar Gupta said the following about IFF's stance in today's hearing:

>""IFF represents Indian internet users and their fundamental rights, and not Big Tech. This requires us to take principled positions on what’s the best outcome possible in tough and complex situations.  
Ordinary internet users should have the ability to approach local judicial forums against Big Tech and will lack the financial capacity and resources to travel from remote places in India to judicial forums such as the Supreme Court of India at New Delhi.  This is separate from our substantive position which we have explained and our stance has been taken after considerable deliberation and inputs from our external team of lawyers.  
Just like we have filed a technical submission opposing traceability in the Hon'ble Madras High Court, we also opposed the transfer petition after receiving legal advice. According to us, it is best to contest the demand for traceability or social media regulations before the Hon'ble High Court. The High Court judgement will of course be subject to appeal if parties are aggrieved and the transfer petition is dismissed.    
Ultimately foregrounding all of this is our defense of the standards of the Shreya Singhal judgement. This is why we recommend that such complex questions that rest on technical aspects of computer science should be settled by executive and legislative processes rather than through courts. Any such legislative changes or regulations are also similarly open to judicial challenge if they undermine fundamental rights.""

The next hearing in the transfer petition is on 22 October 2019 and we will keep you updated about how this important case progresses. IFF was represented in today's hearing by Udayaditya Banerjee, Ria Singh Sawhney and S. Prasanna, and we are extremely grateful for their continued support.

This little known Mumbai based co-operative bank called ""Punjab & Maharashtra Co-op Bank"" (PMC) has just been placed under [restrictions by RBI for irregularities](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFNS4TsVUAInYjo?format=jpg&name=900x900). The restriction is that depositors cannot withdraw more than Rs. 1000 from their accounts until the bank stops the irregularities and restrictions are lifted. The bank is hopeful that they'll sort it within six months but the depositors are crying. As the famous latin proverb goes: *Caveat Emptor* or *Buyer Beware*, this applies to banks too! After all, banking is just another service like any other and banks are the supplier of that service.

**edit**

I think a good diversification strategy is to have your money spread across multiple nationalized banks like SBI, BOB, Axis, HDFC, etc., don't keep everything in one basket. To further diversify (assuming you have a considerable amount of savings), you can put some in precious metals like gold and silver, crypto-currencies like bitcoins, shares of blue-chip companies like Tata and Reliance, etc.

Its also important to keep doing a yearly or half-yearly review of your whole portfolio, identify the risk factors and shift the components accordingly.",1569313002.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,58,100

It has become a classic case of Boy Who Cried Wolf, its become so bad that now when we have pseudo-Hitlers running the world, people dont give a damn cos they feel that they have heard it all before and dont believe it anymore.

Recently I came across a very interesting post that talked about the negative experiences of someone in the industry. I create this thread with the intention of helping other junior or even senior people in this field to make the right decisions and maximize their potential/salaries etc since I have seen lots of people making mistakes and making wrong decisions in this field.



A bit about me. I have 4 years of experience, graduated from a top college in India, and currently, earn *2.5lac/month* (in hand after taxes) in Thailand (one can save ~2lac easily). A year ago I was in India and I was earning *1.7lac/month* (in hand after taxes). What I want to emphasize is that I do not feel I am as sharp or accurate or intelligent as other people in my college. My gpa wasn't good. I am not a DS/Algo wizard and I have never worked at a company that is famous enough that most people over here would have heard its name. Moreover, I am not even a CS major. I do have my college going for me but I think that alone won't make or break things.



But what I feel I have done well and am good at are 2 things. 1) Making the right choices 2) Believing in myself.



I have worked with many people ranging from average or below average Engineers to pro-level geeks. (When I say below average it just refers to their skills at the point of time when I met them). I have seen people making a lot of wrong choices or just lacking the understanding of what one needs to grow in this field. Without making it too long I would like to explain what I mean.



1. **You are the most important:** Remember that when working at a company you should have one and only one aim, to grow as an Engineer. The company, unless you are a co-founder, doesn't belong to you. So there is no point in working overtime or on holidays/weekends. If you are doing it then do it because you need to grow your skills. When I was at my first job, I wanted to learn as much about Software as quickly as possible. So I worked on independent projects and worked overtime sometimes. But do not do this just to release a feature or fix a bug that doesn't help you in any way. Depending on your work it is possible that a lot of what you are doing is sort of labor work which doesn't really translate to learning something new. At this point, you are just wasting your time to make someone rich who wouldn't think twice before firing you. Learn to differentiate between good and bad work.



2. **How to gauge your growth?:** Are you learning things that have value? Would they help you make a leap in the next job search? Or are you just using the things you already know to fix simple bugs or implement features that a college graduate would be able to do? I left my last job because the work was nothing that would help me grow my skills. But I saw my colleagues who were already working at lower salaries (and had more experience than me) spending more time than me to go the extra mile to ensure that the product was perfect. Such as reporting bugs at non-office hours, testing app during lunch breaks to see if it was working okay, There is nothing wrong in that. But doing this won't help you. Your manager would probably be happy. But you are probably learning nothing new.



3. **Are your colleagues smart?:** I feel the most important thing which determines where your career would go is the kind of people you work with. This is extremely important. My career may have taken a completely different direction if I didn't work with the right people. Smart people will have a great impact on you if you are able to learn from them. At one of my previous companies where we were trying to come up with a product/startup idea, my CTO, who was technically amazing, used to reject any idea that wasn't technically challenging. And I can now see why. If you are an Engineer your value is in your skills. And improving or growing them should be your only focus. I see people from my college who were as smart or smarter than me. But today they seem to have not evolved much from the point they entered the industry. Their salaries are much lower, they are technically not that good, simply because they worked with the wrong set of people who didn't know better.



4. **Knowing your value and being a good negotiator**: I have seen smart people who are probably lazy or unconfident of their value as a developer. They end up taking crappy jobs that don't pay much and have nothing to learn. This will come when you are confident of yourself and that will happen when you know you are really good.





**What does having good skills or being a good Engineer means?**



Most people who are technically smart would immediately be able to gauge your Software expertise by looking at your resume. And almost all smart people would know this when talking to you. When going just by the interview route this simplifies to



1. **Being at least decent in DS/Algo:** You don't need to be a god or a red coder on Topcoder but you should know the basics.



2. **Knowing the latest technologies/trends in your field:** Software industry keeps on involving. You need to be aware of the latest apis and tools in the area you work in. For eg if you are an Android developer, in the current time, you should know what MVVM is and how to use it. If you are using activities all over your app instead of Fragments, your interviewer won't be impressed.



3. **Having a good understanding of what good code means:** SOLID, clean architecture, modular code, decoupling should be things you should know well.



4. **Having a very well understanding of your language/framework:** For eg: If you are a front developer who uses Javascript you should be very comfortable with JavaScript, AngularJS and it's concepts. You should know the why's behind things and not just the hows?

**How do I make more money?**



There are 2 ways as far as I know



1. **Work at big tech or Investment banking companies:** You will need to be really good at DS/ALgo to get into these, especially the tech ones. I am not very sure about the Banking ones but I think it would be similar. Key is to be great in DS/Algo. This is also what is needed to land jobs in the top paying companies in US and worldwide.



2. **Work at early age startups:** This is very underrated. The competition would be less and you can make very good money. And the chances to learn are enormous. Just find the right people and not some wannabes who just want to be 'entrepenuers'. Look at the investors, the CTO, how technically good he is and what the product is.





**How to find a job abroad?**



There are lots of Software Jobs abroad. And I feel it isn't very difficult if you really want to move abroad. (Not considering US, that is a different story)



1. **Your resume should instantly stand out:** This is a topic in itself but I see so many people with subpar resumes and making obvious mistakes that they would be rejected in the initial screening despite having the potential to get the job.



2. **Experience:** Unless you are from a top college and are super smart or have worked at great Tech companies, you would ideally need 3 years of experience before you stand a good chance to get a job abroad.



3. **Communication skills:** Your English should be good



**Bonus tip:** Be a likable person. Don't be a bootlicker, pushover, arrogant or any person who is hard to work with.



I am sure this doesn't cover everything but if anyone has any questions I would love to answer them.



PS: There is nothing wrong in not caring much about money and this post may or may not be for you. That isn't the point of this post.",1569332578.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,121,351

3928,"In the market of lies, truth also needs to be repeated often to gain legitimacyJoseph Goebbels who was Hitler's propaganda manager once said that if you repeat a lie enough number of times, not only will people be convinced of it, but even you'll start believing it yourself after a while!

As a corollary to that, can't we said that if the *truth* isn't repeated that often (but only talked about silently and in muted form), not only will people be unconvinced of it but you'll also start disbelieving in it after a while!

The nazis were defeated in WW2 but I think the modern day media and politics predominantly runs on this Goebbels mantra. The problem is that if everyone starts repeating everything, it becomes difficult to identify the truth. In this market of politics, truths and falsehoods are indistinguishable because everyone is trying hard at building narratives, nobody wants to present facts as it is and let the audience decide. I think the days of doordarshan and dd-news were much better because nobody was running a narrative or propaganda, it was all pure facts and audience made whatever they wanted to make of it!",1569304942.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,1,8

I am android/ios developer so I make apps and also do freelancing. After I rejected contract they told me they will make necessary changes but after that they have not gave me any contract or I have signed any documents.I used to get salary on time maybe sometimes maximum 2-3 days later but that's it so situation works for me as office was near from my home and also mine financial situation was bad. Now, few months back I released audio related app on appstore and getting good amount from it($150/week) Also, I was not planning to leave my current job as I know how volatile app market is.One week ago both co founders called me in their office and told me that ip of app belongs to them as I made it while working on their office premise( whenever I had workfree day I used to work on my app on my own laptop but used office internet). When I refused they fired me and now they are threatening me that they will send legal notice. I am worried even though I am getting good money now from my app, app market is really uncertain and I don't even have experience letter to show my experience to any future employer not even salary slip( salary used to credit directly in my bank account from one of co founders name).

3975,"[Rant] My family's love for Modi. I'll try to keep this as short as possible, but for context's sake, I (21F) am the youngest child in a family of five. My brother and I are currently in the US, and my dad is visiting for the weekend in between work.

Yesterday, my mum calls frantically and tells us to start watching TV because Modi's rally is starting. My dad jumps at the opportunity, finds a livestream, and the overdramatic PR stunt of this rally starts playing. Both Modi and Trump lie on TV, fake being best friends for a couple of hours, and I think, well, at least that is over. (Side note, ""Ab ki baar, Trump sarkaar,"" really made me want to throw something at the TV, but never mind that.)

Fast forward to dinner tonight, and Kashmir is brought up. And I won't go into the details, but my dad's defence for the clampdown is to prohibit terrorism. My brother agrees. And the crown jewel, is the following conversation:

Dad: Sometimes you have to compromise most people's freedoms to ensure security.

Me: For how long? It's been two months, and we haven't heard anything from either the people or the media.

Dad: These things can do on for years.

Me: You're saying you don't see anything wrong with a state being silenced for years together?

Dad: It's for their protection.

I was SO CLOSE to losing it. I've always known my parents were hardcore BJP supporters, and I have never agreed with them or their belief that Modi is the answer to our country's problems, but this was a whole new level. I hate saying this, because I do love my family for almost everything but their political views, but I'm pretty disgusted at my dad's nonchalant attitude. My brother kept making comparisons to being at an airport, saying stuff like, ""Everyone has to get a security check done when travelling, so think of this like that."" I was so baffled, I couldn't come up with a counter-argument.

I'm angry at my parents and their worldview, but any debate with them goes to them citing historic events (for example, surprise surprise, the Kashmiri pandits were brought up today) which I'm not super familiar with considering this stuff happened before I was born. Other gems they bring up:

""We've lived longer than you.""

""You've only just started paying attention to the world, so you don't know what you're talking about.""

""You follow leftist news.""

I love my family, I really do, but their political views are driving me up the wall. I have so many conflicting feelings about their ideology and their behaviour, it's keeping me up at night. Anyone in similar situations? How do you deal with this?",1569305278.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,95,144

While i have been always shy and hesitant to talk to strangers i.e. shop keepers, cab drivers etc i have been working on myself. Recently i have moved jobs and started being more social. The only thing this has led me to is unwanted attention from men. They keep trying to either use their power in office or try their hardest to reach me. The thing is i see through all of this. Hating their conniving behavior. All the while making feel self conscious, inept - socially and otherwise.

I have found myself in a social space where i do not feel like i belong or am able to really befriend anyone. The only person i like hanging out with is a guy who keeps hinting at being more than friends. He is 2 years younger, not much to look at and i keep trying to make it obvious that us hanging out does not mean anything more than that. (His looks do not matter in any way , its just i am not attracted to him, also he's in office and you don't shit where you eat. ) All the while receiving jabs from random strangers.  


  
So

The guy in car pool.

The senior colleague who is really trying to be overly friendly.

The only guy in office who i consider a friend but is trying to hit on me.

The random guy in shop who somehow caught my name and now has contacted me on social media.

1. The only academic criterion to apply for this program is that you should have cleared the 12th standard. No other degree/experience is required for this program.

1. Software Engineering is the most in-demand and an ever-growing skill set required in the world. We have more than 50 hiring partners like Flipkart, Ola, Uber, Amazon, Sharechat, MPL, Instamojo, etc.

You get software engineering job is companies like ""Flipkart, Ola, Uber, Amazon, Sharechat, MPL, Instamojo"" but you don't even need a degree? 10+2 is enough? Something seems fishy.

Also do they really have tie-ups with those companies? Why would they accept people with no degree?

Payments:

* Option 1 - One-Time Fee Student pays at the beginning of the course, a fixed fee of ₹2 lakhs (Inclusive of GST). No additional amount needs to be paid after this at any stage of the program or after completion.

* Option 2 - Income Share Agreement (ISA) The student signs an Income Share Agreement (ISA) with Masai School. No upfront payment needs to be made. You need to pay only after you get a job with a salary of ₹6 lakhs per annum (before taxes). The payment will be done in monthly installments @15% of the per month gross salary. The installments will continue till the 36th month or until you have paid us an amount of ₹3 lakhs, whichever is earlier.

**They say they will take money only if you get a job above ~6 lpa otherwise you will not be charged any money.** Too good to be true?

* we are going to invest hugely on your learning we will need a security collateral from your end. For this purpose, you will have to give us two undated Bank Account Cheque of ₹ 1,00,000 each (**You don't need to have this amount in your bank account, this is only for the security purpose**).

This is terrible advice, if they decide to cash the cheque and you didn't have balance in the bank you might end up in jail. Controlling tactic?

Should I join this? Any one studied or worked there? 

What do you think about it? Too good to be true?

I asked him if he had any preferences. He didn't say anything in particular, but from our discussion, I think he'll prefer a gift than some money.

So I'm going to ask for your help here. Do you have any ideas of a cool gift for a traditional Indian wedding (there will be a wedding and a reception, I'm going to both)? 

Some info : I'd say we're both ""fairly well-off"" (both of us work in tech). We're friend, but mainly colleagues. We're not super close. I'm traveling all the way to India for the wedding and reception, but the fact that I had a conference in Asia a week later also helped.

I plan to do this for about 25 days after Diwali and I hope that staying in hostels … and travelling and other things... it'll come under 40k …

Places that I wish to visit:

I'll take a train(the 3AC) from Delhi to ...

Rajasthan: It has so much variety and colours and is different from the North where I'm from and also from Canada haha… so I'd like to experience it and please tell me how much time should I spend in each place.

Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Udaipur(Chittorgarh, Kumbhalgarh, Ranakpur), Pushkar ( it has that camel festival from 4th November)… I don't think there's much in Jaipur!.... maybe a day in Ranthambore National Park too since I have never been in a safari before.

After this I'm confused about where to go...I think I could either go from Udaipur to Mumbai( 16 hrs).... then Goa( 13 hrs)... then Hampi( 8 hrs)… (I feel like this is a really interesting place unlike any other, so this deserves a visit) …staying few days in each place but then I'm unsure which way to come back and also if so many places are even possible... should I return the same way and the take a final flight from Mumbai(5k) if I go this way?

Or I could go east to Khajuraho temple from Udaipur( 22 hr train journey)… then to Varanasi( 13 hrs)… But I think this is a bit astray from the typical route and I'm not sure if I should go to Varanasi but it also attracts me because it would be the most Indian place .

Now places I have already visited which I'm leaving are Taj Mahal and Golden Temple and Agra... and the cold places of north... Also, I have a tour planned to Andaman Islands next month with my family... so maybe I could spend less time in Goa if you guys advise me go through that route.

P.S. I'll be 19 by the end of this trip and this is going to be my first trip ever which I'll document on my camera too. Besides, I( a dude) figured that if solo women from the west could manage to stay safe in India... I can pull this through too ! Any advice you all give would be appreciated.

I feel it's too early to claim that. What I want to do is discuss the possible short term and long term effects. 

The government has slashed one of its most important revenue sources  by a large percentage. 

Where are they planning to get this deficit  from would be my first question? This is going to leave a pretty big dent in their budgets - are they planning on raiding the RBI coffers again? Will the government sell off their stake in PSU's, in line with their strategy by 2021 to raise the cash? Let's discuss. 

Moving on, for it actually affect the economy I feel that the companies that will benefit from this cut will have to pass on the benefit to the consumers so that consumption can get a boost. The good part is that they have ample time to realign their pricing strategies for Diwali and the whole festival season. A lot depends on how corporate reacts to the tax rate cut - will they reap the profits or will they try to boost consumption? A lot depends on this question.

Lastly, there are some metrics I feel that need to be tracked which will give a good idea of the impact - all focused around consumption primarily. I'd say other than underwear sales, car sales, multi-brand retail store footfalls, big Bazaar/dmart/etc footfalls, home loan interest repayments, etc.

Somebody from XYZ insurance company will call you saying you purchased a policy 8-9 years back and paid 1 premium only. They will have your basic data to convince you. They will then tell you that the policy is going to lapse within 30 days and you've a chance to renew it within 24 hours. Once you show interest, you'll be told that the insurance agent will call you.

In the next call, you'll be given 3 options:
1. Let the policy lapse, you'll get 10% of the premium you paid. 
2. Pay the remaining premium for 8 years and continue it till 10/15 years.
3. Pay some X amount and get X+25% return within a month. 

Well, IT'S A SCAM!! If you agree for 3, which looks like the smartest choice, they'll end up selling you a new policy and vanish in thin air.

4347,"The usage of ""only""So I'm sorry but I must ask this:

Have you guys ever noticed the usage of the word only in an unusual way by Indians, especially our southern brethren? Statements like:

- ""I only told you to do that""

- ""That is only why I was saying that, sir""

- ""You only insisted on buying that, no?""

That ""only"" during usage in these types of sentences is preceded by an additional emphasis on the words preceding it and the word ""only"" itself has a bit of a peculiar tone to it and is grouped tightly with the words preceding it when spoken. These statements are also generally very polite/friendly in tone.

I have lived in the Americas and Europe and I've never heard of the word ""only"" being used anywhere else like this. It's like they try to emphasize it by attempting to find an equivalent to their local language. The closest equivalent I can think of in hindi would be, ""Maine hi bola tha tujhe aisa karne ko"" and that ""hi"" is probably what they're trying to compensate for with the usage of ""only"".

4349,"PSA for vapers: Considering making your own ejuice.Luckily after the vape ban, I still have around 300ml of e-juice in stock but many people don’t. I got many messages asking for leads for juice. Lot of us are dependent on it. Luckily we can still vape, Ministry of Health told us that. 

Devices, pods and coils can be obtained through AliExpress or FastTech; most of them will come under the radar as long as you’re careful. 18650 batteries are also legally available. 

Considering making your own ejuice, once you’ve all the ingredients, you just need a few hours on a weekend to make ejuice that’ll last you probably an entire year. I used to DIY my juice 2 years ago, before it became freely available in India. I plan to go back to DIYing once my stock is done. 

Initial investment might add up but you’ll be set for long time. I used to make 1 litre of ejuice at a time and be set for like 8 months or so. Used to cost me 10K to make a batch back then, that too I was careless, used to order random random quantities. With more attentiveness, can bring down the cost. 

Head on over to r/diy_ejuice for help. Check website called steam-engine.org for calculators, recipes, etc. Ton of videos on YouTube as well. 

There are 4 components in ejuice: 

1. PG: Legally obtainable in the market. For 50/50 mix, you just need little bit less than 500ml of this. Will cost I think approximately 2K. Unsure of the figures. 

2. VG: Same as PG, it’s legal to buy. This will cost a grand for 500ml. 

3. Flavouring: Many sites sell flavouring. It’s legal to buy flavouring. Many Indian sites are there but I buy from flavorwest.com, they ship to India for 20 USD. There was a small customs fee the last time I ordered it. 

4. Nicotine. This is the hardest thing to source. My advice is to ask someone coming from US/UK to get you a high nicotine level liquid, something like 48mg and dilute it down to your level. So planning to ask a friend to get me 30ml of 48mg/72mg nicotine. The bottle will be small enough for customs to ignore it. Please take precautions with this, handle it with gloves since this can be quite dangerous. If you’ve the contacts, this can also be acquired locally. Many ejuice manufacturers are in India and they’ll sell you this stuff. I’m not sure about nic salts, many people make their own nic salts ejuice but I’ve never tried it. 

Go to steam-engine, check out the recipes of your favorite ejuice, buy those, it’ll be hard to replicate them exactly but people generally are in the ballpark. Simple fruit and mint flavours are super easy to make and replicate. Once you’ve all the ingredients you want. And you’ve mixing equipment (syringes, gloves, bottles), you’re good to go. 

Head over again to steam-engine, enter the values in the calculator and just mix them together. Steep them and you’re set. Good luck. 

Also we probably need a Indian vaping subreddit just to share stuff on it. If there’s interest, probably someone can volunteer to run it.

BACKGROUND:
I am a first generation citizen with immigrant parents from Mexico. I am largely invested into politics domestic and international, and my perspective on Modi is shaped by my Indian/Paki friends, my Indian girlfriend, and the articles/videos I watch. I’ve come to notice a huge difference in opinions.

VIEW (OPEN TO CHANGE):
So as far as I see it, Modi is a Hindu Nationalist who indulges fear over minorities to rule, essentially a fascist. I hope many of you condemn fascism as India is the world’s largest democracy.

QUESTION:
Dear Indians, or anyone of Indian decent who is interested

Is Modi a fascist? (Based on his actions/views/speeches, etc.)

Thank you! :) btw I love rajma

Some background info about me : I come from a minority community  and add to that the fact that I belong to the region which has been in the news for quite some time now . Managed to fly down to the capital, got a glimpse of the internet/mobile network/cable TV after 45 fucking days.  To make things clear I've always ascribed to the idea of India as enshrined in the constitution. I love the country don't get me wrong. Its the only place that I will call home.  But since quite a long time now  (Starting 2014 , exacerbated by many events like  yogi as cm , Pragya as MP, mandir masjid by PM, Citizenship bill and other recent events and new phenomenon like lynchings) I have slowly started getting disillusioned . Not from the great idea that the country stood for originally but looking at the course that we have taken, things DO NOT seem to be anywhere near okay. The general rhetoric in the common masses, the narrative that is being set appalls me. I open any media outlet or any news channels except a few of course and also some personal experiences of myself and friends and the kind of hatred that I see there for me and the people that have similar ethnic/religious background as myself , all of this leaves me hopeless and makes me angry too. I recently finished my bachelors and being the idealistic person I am,decided to right away start preparing for upsc. I loved the idea of serving the country ,of doing my best for the people and to be honest I am confident to some extent that given my academic history i'll manage to crack it if I put in the required efforts. But lately I've found myself thinking about what next?. What if we end up in a place where I am an unwanted person. Idealistic as I may be but I am a human being after all and as such i have some dreams and aspirations for myself. I would spend all my life in a country that is  massively lacking in many aspects/amenities , would it even be worth it? I come from a financially sound family. My parents are educated and I've been brought up in a comfortable environment. The current atmosphere in the country, when I think about it makes me feel suffocated. I've deleted all my social media so you can rule out the eco chamber phenomenon as the reason. Now I find myself thinking about pursuing masters from abroad and settle there? I need a perspective from others , Am I worrying about it too much? is the situation really that bad ? or have i got it all wrong and am missing the real image somehow?

Good morning Texas,
Good morning America,
Greetings to my fellow Indians in India and around the world.

Friends,

This morning we have a very special person with us. He needs no introduction. His name is familiar to every person on the planet.

His names comes up in almost every conversation in the world on global politics. His every word is followed by tens of millions.

He was a household name and very popular even before he won on to occupy the highest office in this great country.

From CEO to Commander-in-Chief, from boardroom to the Oval Office, from studios to global stage, from politics to the economy and to security he has left a deep and lasting impact everywhere.

Today he is here with us. It is my honor and privilege to welcome here in this magnificent stadium and magnificent gathering.

And I can say I had a chance to meet him often and every time I found the friendliness, warmth, energy, the President of the United States of America – Mr. Donald Trump.

This is extraordinary, this is unprecedented.

Friends,

As I told you we have met a few times and every time he has been the same warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit. I admire him for something more.

His sense of leadership, a passion for America, a concern for every American, a belief in American future and a strong resolve to Make America Great Again.

And he has already made the American economy strong again. He has achieved much for the United States and for the world.

Friends,

We in India have connected well with President Trump. The words of candidate Trump – Abki Baar Trump Sarkar rang loud and clear and his celebration in the White House lit up millions of faces with joy and appreciation.

When I met him for the first time he said to me, ‘India has true friend in White House.’ Your presence here today is great testimony to that.

In these years our two nations have taken the relationships to new heights. Mr. President this morning in Houston, you can hear the heartbeat of this great partnership in this celebration of the world’s two largest democracies.

You can feel the strength and depth of human bonds between our two great nations. People are at the heart of all relationships from Houston to Hyderabad, from Boston to Bengaluru, from Chicago to Shimla, from Los Angeles to Ludhiana, from New Jersey to New Delhi.

Hundreds of millions are glued to their TV even though it is rather late on a Sunday night in India millions around the world, in different time zones are with us today. They are witnessing history in the making.

Mr. President, you had introduced me to your family in 2017 and today I have the honor to introduce you to my family, over a billion Indians and people of Indian heritage around the globe.

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you my friend, a friend of India, a great American President Mr. Donald Trump.",1569181061.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,0,13

I'm asking this question because the impression that I get is that there was a huge gap between what the Indian National Congress wanted (a strong Indian central government) and what the Muslim League wanted (safeguards for India's Muslim minority and huge provincial autonomy with a very weak center). Thus, I'm wondering what exactly a realistic compromise between the INC and ML would have actually looked like as well as which point in time was the latest \*realistic\* time for such a compromise to actually be created and accepted by both the INC and the ML. In hindsight, the partition of India might look inevitable but before the 1940s, this might have very well not been viewed as actually being the case. AFAIK, the partition of India was something that would have been extremely unexpected 20 or even 10 years before it actually occurred.

- The thing is politicians have always controlled the fourth pillar of democracy, the reason we see this now is that we have various sources of an information, we have access to many perceptions or versions of a story we have learned to look conspicuously at every piece of information we get. 

- In future if another party emerges to power they can easily manipulate majority of media to defame the leaders who for now is being cherished by the media houses. 

- it is obvious that the politicians uses media to set a distracting narratives, to avoid accountability. 

- All we can do now is educate ourselves and be patient with current journalism crisis.

- Also this is  disturbing that news have come to two different extremes, either  pro-ruling party or anti- ruling party , the real news has vanished,the crucial, the positive, educational, informative  news is missing.

Our financial condition, however, improved somewhat after I started to get a scholarship. I am currently studying in a university and my brother is trying to get into an IIT. 

My father left us a small amount of land (unused up till now) in a busy street in my hometown. Even through all the hardships we've endured, my mother never sold this land and always thought of it as a back-up for even harder times. Now, I want to start something of my own in that place that does not require a huge capital and can bring some money to aid in my brother's studies. My mother is still very active and can look after the business.  I have talked to a local kid that I know who is good with computers and has agreed to work for us.

I'm not looking for something big as this is my starting point and I have zero experience in managing a business. I also don't want to just rent the place out. Some of the ideas I'm going through:

4575,"[rant] Can we stop calling old Bollywood movies with popular music as ""Super Duper Hit""Just heard someone on radio calling ""Janbaaz"" a ""super duper hit"". No,it wasn't. 1986 was a lean year for Bollywood, with ""Swarg se Sundar"", a Mithun starrer only certified hit. ""Janbaaz"" was a flop.

Internet now has a bad habit of distorting history; especially when it comes to Bollywood and its poor record keeping ability and habit to exaggerate. Thanks to that, movies like ""Saagar"" and ""Silslila"" are now considered super hit.

No one now talks about Amitabh's dry spell in 80s and 90s, his ill-fated AB productions and how it almost bankrupted him.

People who make such claims do not realise there are lots of other people who have lived the same history and very well alive to refute their claims. However, it's sometimes the apathy of common public that let people distort history.

Also, a lot of models are going nude for their own apps. You probably know who I am talking about. Sherlyn Chopra, Poonam Pandey, and now, Anveshi Jain. Why?

Mental health is a very personal cause for me, and I find it very unfortunate that a large number of people do not have access to proper mental health providers. One reason could be that mental health has been traditionally stigmatised in India. The cost factor can be another issue with not many people being able to afford it.

I live in bellandur and there is an unpaved road behind me (my room) and there has been construction going on for awhile. Because it is not in the main city the workers behave like they own the place. Tractors play very loud, obnoxious music whenever they pass by (about 10 times a day), and construction trucks honk on empty roads repeatedly. And the workers themselves a few times a day take it on themselves to yell and shout and behave like urchins.

The police came twice, after about 10 ksp app complaints. They said they will do something. Nothing has happened. Second time they came for some reason they took a photo of ME, not sure what that was for.

4821,"My assessment on Indian Olympics contingentI was very excited about India's chances at Rio Olympics but sadly we were very unlucky there. I was very heartbroken after last Olympics. Been following Indian Olympics sports very closely for last 4 years and I feel this time we can genuinely finish with 10 medals (if we get some luck in our favour). Here are my predictions :-

1) Shooting is very unpredictable sport but this time we have many fearless youngsters who are performing exceptionally well. We should win more than 3 medals at least if all goes well. Our best chances are in events like 10m Air Pistol (both men & women), 10m Air Rifle (both men & women) and Mixed Air Pistol & Mixed Air Rifle team event. You can check performance of our shooting team here https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_ISSF_World_Cup

2) Mirabai Chanu is most certain to win a medal for us at Tokyo. At recently concluded World Championship she finished at fourth place with Chinese occupying top 2 spots. But in weightlifting, a country can only send one athlete in Olympics so that means Mirabai will be 3rd at worst. She is currently 13 kg ahead from her nearest competitor https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Weightlifting_Championships_%E2%80%93_Women%27s_49_kg

3) I think everyone here is aware about Sindhu's badminton exploits. So I won't explain too much. We can also win a surprise medal in men's singles.

4) In Wrestling, Vinesh Phogat & Bajrang Punia is most certain to win a medal for us. We can also win one or two medals from wrestling if we get a favourable draw. Check our wrestling performance from ongoing World Championship https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_World_Wrestling_Championships

5) Amit Panghal is a favourite to win a medal in boxing. He is current Asian Games & Asian Championship gold medalist. He has recently won a silver in World Championship. There were 3 other Indian boxer who were in QF at world championship. I'm slightly unsure about India's chances in women's boxing.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_AIBA_World_Boxing_Championships

Outside of these 5 sports, we have half-chances to win a medal in few other sports like Archery, Hockey, Golf and Tennis. I'm not expecting any medals from athletics. Only Niraj Chopra can finish inside top 5 in athletics event.

This is my own assessment. Please tell me if I'm missing some other medal contenders.",1569126985.0,#ffbbda,Sports,dark,13,13

I do not like my college nor am I enjoying my course all that much. My social life is below average but my academics are good. The only reason that I go to college is because I'm an NCC cadet. I enjoy the challenge that NCC provides and my primary aim is to go for the Republic Day Camp and to generally excel in the corps. Joining the armed forces is a possible career path for me but I am not firm on it.

My father wants me to study abroad as it is indeed a life changing experience. I have been abroad a few times and enjoyed myself there a ton. I know that going abroad isn't necessarily going to mean that suddenly my college and social life will magically improve but the people who I know that have studied abroad have told me that it's one of the best decisions that either their parents or they have taken and wish it was done earlier.
 
Finally my primary concern is this, Am I missing out on an awesome experience by not studying abroad or will I benefit more from taking part in a National Level NCC camp (which is not set in stone as I do have to go through a selection process)",1569125151.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,14,20
4826,"Change my view: Food deliveries and cab rides do not automatically deserve a 5 star rating by default.I have seen a lot of Swiggy/Zomato delivery guys and Ola/Uber cab drivers ask for 5-star rating once the delivery is done, or the ride is over. Why does doing the bare minimum warrant a 5-star rating? And while the companies handing out incentives based on this is great, 4-star ratings aren’t “bad”.  


I always give a 4-star rating, and reserve the 5 for exceptional service when the guy goes out of his way to help, or is extremely polite, and so on. People I know look at me like I’m the devil incarnate. I mean, what the fuck?

4849,"My views on the current right wing inclined folks today.I won't deny that I have never really inclined towards
 the right tor the left but there are certain things that I
 like more about each side. For example, the left
 believing in the rights of the LGBT community. But
 well, when Congress was in power, I was more on the
 conservative side because Congress really felt like a 
 ""pappu"" government in my opinion. I'm from
 Hyderabad, so, I never had to vote for Congress or
 the BJP and I'm happy about not having to choose
 one of them. Congress had some questionable
 policies but the situation the BJP has led our country
 into, I mean It's Outrageous.

 I've never seen Modi  commenting on the Unnao rape victim. I've never  seen him assure the country about the current economic situation. He simply doesn't seem to care. Poor Tulsi, lost some of her followers for meeting Modi. Such is the impression that our beloved PM has on the international stage. I don't know, I don't see these Modi praisers talking about the economy at all. I am a little inclined to the right more than the left but this is just shameful that this guy called Modi has led us into this pit. I've never seen him addressing the nation on the issues at ground level. All he does is spew out patriotic and emotional bullshit. I am patriotic and all but it alarms me that our PM has no say in the mob lynchings. I'm from Hyderabad, I live in a population dominated by Hindu and Muslimcommunity's. There have been minor clashes here and there but there were no riots and no bad blood between the two communities. Hell, I have so many Muslim friends, but growing up with them I've never felt the difference between my Hindu and Muslim friends. 

You see, with all these lynchings and forcing
 of Jai Shree Ram slogans has affected one way or the
 other. Before all this crap, we used to break each
 others balls, make fun of the religions and never got
 anyone offended. Suddenly, I look around now and
 we are still the same mates we were, but we think
 twice before bringing up a religious joke. That's what
the Modi government has given us. Everybody has
 the internet, everyone knows what's happening, this
 has to be addressed. Our country's economy, our
 secularism, our linguistic freedom, have all gone
 down the drain and when these right wing people
 talk about Modi as if he descended from the whitest
 clouds, it makes my skin crawl.",1569148705.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,40,69

5019,"Solo traveller in India. Despite what the government travel adverts sell, most of the country is absolutely filthy, the people are disgusting and there is too much nastiness. It doesn't matter how good of a person you are, you could be a saint, but at some point in India you will slap a beggarNothing too interesting here just my experience in India.

I want to apologize in advance if there are Indians here whom may find me offensive, it is not my intention. I am simply just expressing my thoughts on your country, I am sure people will disagree, feel free to contradict me (or agree with me).

We are in India doing the golden triangle + kolkota, and in all honesty I am not liking it. This place is disgusting. I have seen many dirty places (Manila, Phnom Phen) but India is something else. The constant shit everywhere, rubbish, smell, people spiting, squatting, is really taking its toll me on.

Now I was semi-expecting this in New Delhi, but Agra is even worst. This is a small city of Taj Mahal and its filthy as fuck. Its so dirty you literally have pigs scavenging through piles of rubbish on side of main road. The Agra train-station, holly shit don't get me started on Agra's train-station. There was millions of locusts everywhere, literally millions. There was stranded dogs there who shat everywhere. There were monkeys (in all honesty that was cool), but the monkeys also shat everywhere. So the monkey and dog shit attracted flies and bugs, so lots of flies and bugs too. Homeless people sleeping there and washing themselves in the drinking area. To top it off my train was 4 hours late, got delayed in 45-minute blocks about 5 times or so, so spent 4 hours sitting amongst shit and locusts and flies and bugs. I was starving but seeing what I saw and smelt my appetite had completely gone.

Then comes the hard sales. Look I get it, every poor country pressures tourists to buy buy buy. But here is on another level. They will follow you and keep pressuring. Everyone is constantly asking you to buy, you cannot escape it. I had this in Thailand and Cambodia so I am no stranger to it, but fuck me these people are taking it to the extreme. Then there's the tok-tok drivers. Its a constant battle between me wanting to go where I want to go vs them taking me to where they want me to go. They always taking me to shops to get tip from shop owners. Today we told the guy multiple times we want to go to Mcdonald's (GF is over spicy food), and still he took us to some fancy restaurant.

Then comes the dishonesty. They will say anything to get a rupee. They are not interested in your needs but rather interested in your money, to a extreme point. I ask if they have a coffee machine and brew there coffee, they say yes and charge me extra and I can taste its a 3-in-1 coffee. I know my coffee goddammit. One guy gave us the wrong change, when I complained he gave me the correct change instantly, but he couldn't speak a word of English so how he know exactly how much to pay me is a mystery.

But what I hate the most, is that this environment is making me a worst version of myself. I am becoming rude to people as its the only way I can get them to leave me alone. Which is odd because after working in customer service I promised myself to never be rude to a working person. Yet I find myself almost shouting at them to leave me alone, and completely ignoring them as if they are not worthy of my sight.

I am in Jaipur now and in all honesty I am liking Jaipur allot more. People are not so pushy and the city is allot cleaner. I regret not being able to stay in Jaipur longer but flights are booked.

Now don't get me wrong, Taj Mahal is amazing, Fort Amer is breath-taking, the food here is mouth-watering, Victoria memorial was really cool.

So I literally just got back from a trip to take my GF to see camels. We arranged with the Tok Tok driver to take us there, wait for us then back for 170rupees. On the way he kept trying to get us to go to certain restaurants, when we refused he tried to take us to go shopping, until I snapped and told him we are not going anywhere besides camels and then we want to go back to hotel. After the camel ride he pressured us to go somewhere for ""photos"". He wouldn't take no for an answer and said it's not far, so we reluctantly went. Before we knew it we were heading well out of the city, and when I tried to ask him where we are going he would say ""don't worry no extra charge you take photos"". When we started entering residential areas my GF got scared if something bad happens to us as we are getting well out of the city. So I told the driver to turn around, he said ok however he wouldn't actually turn around. The situation escalated and I found myself to be shouting at him and demanding him to stop right now and drawing unwanted attention to our Tok-Tok . He stopped and we hoped out immediately in butt-fuck nowhere and made our own way back by ourselves.

I don't know what his intentions where. He could have been a very honest and genuine person just wanting to show us around his city. But given the whole time he was trying to get us to go to certain places and refused to turn around and take us back to our hotel my conscience got the better of me.",1569071637.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,12,4

But, I can't decide between All new kindle and All new kindle Paperwhite. the only difference seems to be that paperwhite is waterproof. Is that alone worth spending an additional 5000? 

Also this might sound stupid, but is the quality of the product during mass purchase period such as this sale, good enough?

In interest of conciseness I'll mention that I failed a year in engineering alongwith a friend of mine. Post passing the subjects I was promoted to the next semester.

Friend and I began the new academic year in a class where most were hostile to us. Initially it was exceedingly difficult to interact with our classmates because we could sense condescension in their remarks. Nevertheless we somehow managed. It's been close to 12 months now. My friend is much loved by most classmates. He's a superstar. I on the other hand am a non entity.


 Most classmates couldn't care less for me. Change in fortune changed me friend. I suspect he no longer has interest in being my friend. He without any hesitation ignores me. I'm resentful and sad.

Being in that class and being ignored hurts. He once told me that he skipped college for 2 days and his phone was filled with messages from classmates asking him if he was alright.

5076,"Unable to marry my gf. Intercaste issues.It's a long post kindly bear with me.

&#x200B;

I'm a 27 year old Bengali Brahmin in love with a 25 year old Rajasthani Baniya girl and have been in a serious relationship for the past 5 years. We are both working in private sector and earn fairly enough. I introduced her to my family at the very start of our relation and they really like her, and do want us to get married. I won't say we are uber rich but my family (my mother ,father and myself and 2 pets) have our own house and come in the upper middle class section.

My gf is a really wonderful person. Witty, charming and very caring. I could not have asked for a better partner.

But her father is dead set against an inter-caste marriage. He doesn't even consider a Brahmin guy but only wants Baniya. His issue is that he thinks society will shun him and he won't be able to answer his family why they chose to wed his eldest daughter to a Bengali (they keep referring to me as Bengali never thinking twice that Bengali is not a caste, Brahmin is). My gf younger sister, younger brother, mother, cousins all are fond of me and do want us to get married, but are helpless due to the obstinate nature of her father. I used to visit her house before we revealed our intentions to her parents, and thus her mother knows me.

It has been more than 2.5 years since her parents came to know of this. At first even her mother refused this marriage proposal and kept insisting on getting her married to their choice. Many potential grooms were selected, but my gf rejected all of them. They took her to meet a potential grooms family, but she told the guy about whats happening. Even that Baniya guy said in today's age caste should not matter but compatibility should.

My gf is growing tired of the increasing restrictions being placed on her. Her father tracks all her movement. She joined a new office recently and according to her she is struggling there as she is unable to concentrate on her work. Her father is refusing to budge. Even her mother now has tried to make him understand that let her get married to her own choice but he would pay no heed to her. Her aunts, although unaware of the situation, have remarked that children should get married by their own choice. But he refuses to listen to logic.

Couple days back her mother tried to overdose on sleeping pills, but got caught by my gf. She is getting frustrated as neither her daughter or her husband refuses to budge. Now that there have been multiple health issues crop up for her father, they are using that to manipulate her into giving in by saying if she agrees to marry a Baniya then her father will start regaining his health (Fuck that logic).

Now after so much time my parent's health has started worsening. They are both close to 70 year olds and are worried that what if something happens to them before I get married.

I speak very less and less with my gf. Hardly meet her once a month. Her father's restrictions and obtuse state of mind is having a very negative affect on our relation and on both our health. I think she is slowly losing the will to fight, and I think my story will also go the way of so many stories ruined by caste restrictions.",1569066933.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,25,42

It came to my realization that why are we trying to prove ourselves better than others and running behind education, shitty corporate jobs and why not instead do simple tasks such as becoming an Uber driver in India with his own car. 

I am not talking about hiring a driver and giving him my car to drive. Car will be mine and I will be driving it myself full time.

Honestly, if there is one thing I that I enjoy doing is ""driving"", and have never felt bored or tired doing it. 
I know driving in traffic will be frustrating but I can manage with good air-conditioning and can even consider an automatic car for the convenience it offers.

The service I will be providing is going to be fully  passenger oriented with utmost professionalism. Something which I wish I had gotten in some of my cab rides

Thoughts? Also do you know anyone who has ventured in the similar field. Please share their experiences as well.

**EDIT:** Thanks guys for all your replies. General opinion is that it's not worth doing in the long run and one should not leave education or his job to pursue this. 

The whole point of bringing up this argument was to try something which you enjoy doing on a daily basis to make your livelihood. Especially for a guy like me who is not into a established job and is still giving some exams.

5294,"Apples & oranges stay fresh for 3-4 weeks without refrigerator. Should I be concerned?My wife is pregnant and we have been buying a lot of fruits recently. Since our fridge is small, we started keeping fruits on the table. To my surprise, oranges stay ok for upto a month (may be more, didn't wait that long). Right now, I have 5 apples and 3 oranges brought 13 days ago, and one orange bought nearly 4 weeks ago sitting outside from the day of purchase. They still look and taste perfectly fine. Oranges have an Australian sticker, not sure about apples. I also had brought some sabarjilli along with them, they started going bad within 1 week to 10 days. Entire batch of custard apple went bad within 3-5 days.

Internet says this:
> [At room temperature, oranges usually keep for up to one week](https://www.stilltasty.com/questions/index/84)

>[If they are on the counter, apples ripen 10 times faster because the enzymes are much more active at room temperature, so they will keep for a week or two maximum](http://shelflifeadvice.com/content/how-long-will-apples-last-and-out-refrigerator)

So I am beginning to worry if they are using some kind of chemical to keep them fresh longer. Temperature in my area is in the 28-33 range. Considering that people are using formalin to preserve fish ([link](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/6000-kg-formalin-laced-fish-seized-kerala-85161)) and making fake milk with paint and shampoo ([link](https://www.vice.com/en_in/article/9kxx9d/indian-scammers-arrested-for-making-fake-milk-out-of-paint-and-shampoo)), there must be something fishy here also.

5302,"About orthodox Indian teasI write a blog about tea, and related to that two people involved with promoting orthodox, small-producer tea production have recently passed on samples.  One was a vendor, the other not in the industry.  The two versions I just tried were from Arunachal Pradesh and Darjeeling, and the two prior to that Assam, along with a falap (bamboo shell compressed smoked tea, more like a Chinese sheng pu'er or hei cha).

It's not easy to get a feel for ""better"" orthodox tea preference and awareness in India.  Most online discussion stops with comments that people know what Darjeeling scope is, roughly, but prefer conventional black teas with milk and sugar, or else masala chai.  So it's a non-issue.  Does anyone have input beyond that, about how preferences seem to be changing, or related to tea experience outside those two main areas?

I'll be clear about my background; I focus more on exploring Chinese teas and versions from South East Asia (since I live in Thailand now, originally from the US).  I like the character of Indian teas, and make masala chai from time to time, but to me the sustainability / producer welfare concerns are as compelling as the teas themselves.  I don't sell tea, or draw any revenue from advertising, but of course all that comes up in discussions and background descriptions.

We are opening an eatery focussing on wholesome tidbits and sips like fruit juice, smoothie and sandwiches. We would like that our eatery gives out vibes of a wellness cafe. After discussion we have come upon some names  and we have decided that we will pick the one that gets the highest vote  . Please participate :)

1) Nutrilicious cafe/eatery/hub (nutritious + delicious)

2) Pathya ( sanskrit word used in aayurveda meaning wholesome, often related to diet). We will use a slogan ""wholesome sips and bites"" under the name.

3)Food karma (as the name indicates)

4) Food Pyramid (pyramid of balanced diet)

5) wholesome platter (we are not sure about the word platter because our principal menu is juice, tea and smoothie)

6) Nutro bites

7) Nutro Pyramid

8) Healthiterian cafe

Please note that despite mu User name the place is not a 100% vegetarian or vegan.

Thanks 😊

[https://delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/notice/pay-notice](https://delhitrafficpolice.nic.in/notice/pay-notice)

Rant : The whole purpose of issuing a challan is to deter people in committing same mistakes again. But the mofos at Delhi police will issue a challan and will not place any system to inform the person. One of my friend is issued 4 challans of over speeding at same spot on 4 different days within 10 days.

Agree, he should be under speed limit in first place but informing the person on time would prevent next 3 violations.

EDIT : So I got to know that Delhi Traffic police informs about the challan through SMS if your number is updated.

5325,"Economic Shit Storm Incoming brace for impact : What failure of corporate tax rate may imply.Before getting bombarded, let me say that it is what if scenario which is rather pessimistic but a possibility nonetheless, and I vehemently believe that we are facing growth recession if not outright recession as of now. 

1) Lack of new job creation, decrease in purchasing power, negligible increase in either headline inflation or core inflation, 2-3% gdp growth rate, if we calculate gdp using previous base year, has substantiated that we are or are heading to recession. Recession doesn't always mean negative gdp growth rate. 

2) Uncertain and draconian policy : Fast changing policies which have proved to be bereft of commitment by actual spending and pervading religious divide and ideology is eating away a part of budget.


Damocles Sword

3) Infrastructure projects underway, but for whome? Bullet train, statues and home creation, but none of them are infrastructure investment which will help economy at scale and will come out to bite few years later.

4) Migrating tendency : Large mobilisation by semi-elite and educated group due to ease of getting residential cards given that you are competent. It should increase by substantial amount after global economy slow down is over and again will bite back later due to the fact that with lack of skilled man power fewer companies will invest


Deflation & Lack of buffer and misguided policies

5) Corporation tax cut : Current situation is because of lack of purchasing power even among those who are employed and even a cursory glance at past will tell that India has never seen tickle down Impact so I don't expect increase in PP 1) It will fail to attract new investment 2) Goods may get cheaper which will lead to deflation.

6) Possible Deflation : With lack of buffer and policy failure, we will spiral down to deflation and products will get cheaper but people will start losing jobs at hitherto rate.

New minted currency as catalyst to breaking economic cycle and perhaps for even worse 

7) Bottleneck Inflation leading to stagflation : Demand will stay the same or may even increase while infrastructure will be severely lacking and to boost economy, we may see new minted currencies and it will lead to rising prices(inflation) but job loss will still stay the same 

8) Lack of foreign investment : Above should be enough to deter any large FDI flow.

On September 14, 2019, the newly constituted Standing Committee on Information Technology was announced by the Government. The Committee will be headed by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor as its chairperson. The Committee comprises of 31 Members of Parliament with 21 from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha.

## Why are Parliamentary Committees important?

Parliamentary committees are vital aids to parliamentary and legislative processes through deliberations, interactions and debates amongst stakeholders to an issue. Raman Jit Singh Chima, co-chair of IFF provides a succinct explanation on the especially on Committee on Information Technology, ""It plays a crucial role in holding government and other entities to account, opening up the policymaking process on technology issues to citizens and expert inputs, and using its power to call for hearings to also serve as a clear signalling function as to the approach the people of India wish on an issue."" ([**Read here for more**](https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/policymakers-must-engage-more-with-technology-firms/story-A0U7kw59OHCU28QOkTTn3M.html)).

At the conclusion of the year, the Committees even provide reports with findings and recommendations which are shared with the Government and tabled in Parliament providing advisory value. Apart from what it seems as entirely too procedural, the Committee is of incredible consequence as it helps hold the Government to account while also providing a platform through submissions or even hearings, for both industry and the public to engage on significant issues.

## We have a few suggestions.

As this new Committee forms, we have taken the opportunity to write to them on three very particular issues:

* *Transparency and accessibility:* We highlight the need for further public participation through comments and also suggest that public depositions will enable better civic engagement and what better way to increase transparency than to begin telecasting proceedings. Wouldn't it be great to have public viewing of these Committees brainstorming?
* *Unfinished homework:* We point out the need to conclude matters deliberated on by the previous Committee such as the consultation on net neutrality and the need to safeguard citizen's data online, to name a few, which are incredibly important issues that need clear outputs.
* *What's in store:* With technology finding new ways to leave us befuddled, we suggest a few prevailing issues such as a legal framework for surveillance reform, the current state of free speech amongst many others, that need proper attention by the Committee.

We're supremely excited to engage with the Committee in every way we possibly can and we hope there will be fruitful deliberation that will result in better governance of technology while putting the fundamental rights of the Indian citizen first.

So stop fucking trying to address the supply side. Today's corporate tax rate cut does nothing to change the underlying issues.

Reducing individual income tax rates would be better.

Reducing GST rates would be better than this. Reducing GST slabs would be better.

Speeding up PM Kisan Yojana spending would be better. [BTW, looks like after the first installment of PM Kisan payments, there seems to have been a moratorium on further tranches. Fucking idiots]

Making it easier to fire employees would be better.

Relaxing FSI (Floor Space Index) rules would be better.

Immediately selling off Air India, MTNL, BSNL, COAL INDIA, etc would be better.

Allowing for-profit pvt education from kindergarden to post grad would be better.

Allowing PSUs and PSU banks to fail, allowing PSUs to be properly sold off (and not this bullshit of being bought by other govt entities). 

Allowing pvt sector and agri corps to fully invest and create profit from agriculture. Allowing agriculture land to be easily sold of at commercial rates for commercial uses.

So many ways to boost the demand side. You do not need to molly coddle big corporates. Neither does that actually make any tangible difference in today's downturn.

5585,"Need guidance on a career as an HRI did my BE civil engineering in a not-so-good college and only after completion, I realised that I am not interested to pursue it as a career as I am not super interested in it.  


Two weeks back, I joined a shitty company in Bangalore as an HR, with 12k as salary. Work involves finding resumes from job portals, call candidates and schedule an interview.   
Being a girl with a gap to 2 years after graduation and not an MBA degree, this is the only job I managed to get close to where I live. Skipped all those voice / non-voice jobs, because I don't feel good and not feel safe, as they have shifts.   


The good thing about my current company is that I get to talk with a lot of people, improving my communication skills and learn a lot on technical hiring. I feel like I did learn a lot in the past 2 weeks I have been with them.   


Bad things are, micromanagement, the manager wants us to leave office only after he leaves. Sometimes that dik-hed is staying in office until 8 PM. Bad work timing, targets, internal politics, and peanut salary.     


So now I made up my mind to make a career in HR but with a good company. What should I do next to really succeed in this field?   


1. Is MBA or other master degree necessary or I will be good with my BE degree ?  


2. How can I improve myself ? From my current job I am not sure if I will learn much.  
Any recommended sites ? youtube channels, books or courses?  


3. How to improve on my own? How to showcase my ability/portfolio?   
Like software engineers can do side projects and put it on Github for their portfolio, what is the similar thing I can do ?   


4. What other jobs HR can transition into ? (business development ? Digital marketing ? ) . So that I can prepare myself for it if needed.",1568965737.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,6

5640,"Infrastructure for Battery v/s ICE carsPeople think filling your tank with petrol at the station is nice and easy compared to charging electric car. 
But people don’t consider the hidden cost. 

1. You have gasoline/LPG/Petrol trucks that deliver the fuel to the station every single day. 

2. Land! These stations occupy prime land in the cities. Cost of land is added to the fuel. 

Now, compare this to the EV. Electricity can be transferred anywhere through the grid. Currently the electric grid covers all of India. And for the exact reason that electricity is available everywhere we can charge our car everywhere and don’t need dedicated land for that purpose. Charging terminals can be put on a wall at the house, the parking lot at the mall and at the workplace, all we need is a few electric cables and a terminal connected to the grid. 

Even now while charging terminals at the parking lots at malls, office parking etc. are not there EVs can still be charged at homes. 

Now look at the charging times. People keep on saying “Oh noes! It takes 30 minutes to charge 50/80%!” But let’s compare that to the time people spend at filling their cars at the fuel station. Waiting time of at least 5-10 minutes, could be more depending upon the time of the day people choose to fill up their bikes/cars. Another 2-3 minutes to fill up the car and making payments. Add another 5-10 minutes if you have to take a detour to reach a fuel station if it isn’t on your usual travel route. So, that is at least 10-15 minutes that people spend when the fill up their cars. Now here is the real kicker. The car takes 10-15 minutes to fill up but you are also spending your 10-15 minutes while filling up your car with Dinosaur juice. 

While with the electric car all we need to do is plug in the car and leave it either at our home or our office or a mall, where we are expected to spend considerable time anyway. We don’t have to stand alongside the car for 30 minutes and monitor it to charge it. The only occasion when this time should impact us is while we are on a highway and forced to charge the car midway to our trip. 

All in all, electric vehicle charging infrastructure over a period of time will be much cheaper compared to the ICE bikes/cars tank filling infrastructure.",1568999543.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,14

While I've other, who is well known but will likely charge a higher fee. Is there any chance of dentist doing a bad job & screwing me in the long run?
2. Should I pick the local dentist who is nearer, because the better one lives farther, takes around 2hrs to reach his clinic,. The local one is available nearly, but he too visits monthly.
3. How frequently do you have to visit the dentist after braces. And are there any emergencies, or just periodic checkups(In how many days usually)?
4. What should be the approx cost. (Age: 24, City: Indore, Type: Metal Braces).
5. If you are from Indore, any recomendations, and estimated cost?
6. Any other advice?

&#x200B;

TL:DR;  Should I save money by going to a lesser known dentist, or should I pick up the one who is better despite costing more(say 5-10K). Is there any chance of dentist doing a bad job & screwing me in the long run? And why?",1568992508.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,12,30
5672,"While we weren't looking, Fall ArmyWorm (FAW) has been ravaging the country's farm lands. Started in Karnataka, now affecting 10+ states.**TL:DR - Fall ArmyWorm is a deadly pest, which ravages through cereal and fruit farms. They are extremely difficult to control/manage as they do not get affected by commonly used/usable pesticides or conventional farming techniques. They spread like nothing we have *ever seen* and has the potential to put the Food Security of the world at risk**


1 **What is Fall ArmyWorm?** - [Wiki link here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_armyworm)

Below quote is from [The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations ](http://www.fao.org/fall-armyworm/en/)

>The Fall Armyworm (FAW), or Spodoptera frugiperda, is an insect that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas. In the absence of natural control or good management, it can cause significant damage to crops. It prefers maize, but can feed on more than 80 additional species of crops, including rice, sorghum, millet, sugarcane, vegetable crops and cotton. **FAW was first detected in Central and Western Africa in early 2016 and has quickly spread across virtually all of Sub-Saharan Africa. In July 2018 it was confirmed in India and Yemen**.

2 **DownToEarth.org has studied and covered the FAW effects in India** - [Article here](https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/agriculture/fall-armyworm-attack-the-damage-done-63445)

(*DownToEarth is an fortnightly magazine, produced by an India based NGO Centre for Science and Environment*)

> * By the time the infestation was detected, it had already become malignant. Khemo Baghel, a farmer of Bade Chakwa village in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar district, took up maize cultivation for the first time early this year. He dug a borewell and was convinced that the return from maize would be better than any other crop. But hardly had the seeds sprouted, he saw some keedas (worms) slowly colonising his farm. “I detected them one morning. There was no trace of them the previous day. I think they landed at night,” he narrates. Within two months, the keedas had a firm grip on his farm, taking away 30 per cent of his maize crop. 

> * Now agriculture scientists and extension officers frequent Bade Chakwa and neighbouring villages and they too are puzzled. But by now, the outlier has a local name: “American keeda”.

> * In Palari village, the American keeda has damaged the entire maize crop. “I have been farming for four to five years, but have never noticed this insect. **Pesticides are not effective on them**,” says Parmeshwar Pandey.

> * In just nine months since FAW was spotted in India in Karnataka last June, it has invaded crops in over 10 states. As if taking a pre-scripted route, FAW infestation has spread from Karnataka to all southern states; then to western Maharashtra and Gujarat; and now to eastern states

> * Besides advancing fast, the pest is also attacking new crops. Though it is being detected mostly in maize crops—a preliminary calculation estimates it has affected nearly 170,000 hectares (ha) of maize crops—there have been reports from states where it has infested paddy, sugarcane and sweet corn. 

> * **Maize is the third most important cereal crop in India after rice and wheat. It accounts for 9 per cent of the total food grain production in the country.**


> * In Andhra Pradesh’s Institute of Frontier Technology — an affiliate of the Acharya NG Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) in Tirupati — crop researchers are a worried lot as the news of infestation has turned from a trickle to a deluge. It was first identified in Andhra Pradesh in August 2018 when it affected maize growing areas of East and West Godavari districts, Srikakulam and Vizianagaram. **“With maize seed production being a major crop in Godavari district, it can have serious economic consequences. Being a major ingredient for the poultry and cattle feed, production losses in maize could cripple meat and milk production**,” says M John Sudheer, principal scientist at ANGRAU.

35 y.o. guy, married, 2.5-year-old daughter (who I absolutely love).

So I have been working for almost 10 years now in an Sales position, currently working at one of the biggest Adtech companies in the country since the last 3 years. Long story short, I have been cornered by asking to report to a peer who is not good enough (which is a widely accepted fact, apart from 1-2 people who have taken this decision). It is imminent that I have to look for a new job but I have been totally demoralized because of multiple reasons. I had been stuck in this job with no growth. I tried looking out but in some cases, the interview was not successful and other cases, I did not like the company so did not go ahead. I have a home loan EMI which is a huge amount so I cannot just quit. On top of that, I have absolutely lost all motivation to do anything so even getting myself to work is a huge task. I seriously feel I have some mental issue going on (since the last 3-4 years) but honestly, I am so short of money every month that I can't even afford an Uber to work (this in spite of having an above-average salary). The problem is I save every month into SIPs so that my daughter never has any financial issues when I pass away. But the city I live in is costly and every month there are unforeseen major expenses because of which I am in this condition. 

I have contemplated killing myself multiple times (I know there are people worse off than me but that thought does not seem to help me) but just cant get myself to do that either. I have very few friends and most of them are just concerned with themselves (or at least I feel so) and I have a feeling that I am constantly being judged by everybody. Its a very long list of what I feel but in short, at this point, I am extremely demotivated and every day seems like a punishment. Anyone with a similar story?

So, what's the happiest moment of your life so far? What was that one moment when you laughed like crazy/felt elated? I am asking about your moments. So, please filter out 'I made my parents proud'.

Edit: here's a hilarious incident that I would never forget. NSFW (in some sense)

So, I am in a third gen of a family that used to be poor. My grandparents were from a village where having power is an exception and power cuts were the norm. Needless to say bathrooms weren't a thing.

We usually have a separate place to do the thing and a water stream nearby to ""purify"" ourselves. But the place also had fields, greenery nearby and hence it's usually scenic in the morning. I have two cousins of similar age. So it was a tradition to do the deed together (when we were children of course)

So one fine morning, we finished the proceedings. But we decided to play. Since we were of similar age, competition is a norm. So for some reason, we decided to have a long jump competition and for some crazier reason, we decided to jump over the water stream itself.

So of the three of us, I am skinny, one guy is fit and the other is not fat but inherently unstable. Me and the fit dude jumped over the stream well and good. The other one unfortunately..... Jumped over the stream, landed perfectly. However, him being unstable fell backwards in the stream immediately after he landed. Imagine going to the place, returning home with wet clothes and then explaining what happened to the whole family. It was a laugh riot. 

To this day, it cracks me up whenever I think of it.",1568987194.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,120,52

5691,"Where in India can I permanently live for free?I am 31 years old and an Indian citizen. I am, I suppose, privileged in many ways however I do not really feel so.

I have had a lot of dreams brutally crushed and have been in and out of financial ruin for no apparently fault of my own.

My parents were abusive and were poor sometimes and rich some other times. So I have a very conflicted reality. I’ve parr’s ways with them because all they really want is to ruin my already dismal life further (this IS true, yes they are my “real” parents, no not every parent is a gem by virtue of being a parent).

I also suffer from depression, anxiety, OCD, and major trust issues. I have dabbled with psychiatry, meditation, Western medication, Ayahuasca (Psychedelic Ceremony) but nothing has really worked out.

The few romantic relationships I have had have not worked out. I do not intend to pursue those anymore. Or marriage, and definitely not children.

We do not have a comprehensive Welfare State here in India and the pit, if one falls in one, is bottomless. It’s not that great in many industrialised countries either (I have lived in one) but it is still fundamentally better - even if it is its own kind of rut.

Inner peace is one thing but a human does have material needs. 

I am tired of the Catch-22s I’ve had to face in live (I am sure everyone does, I am just less resilient and more inclined to brooding) and my will is slayed.

A management level job requires and MBA, MBA requires money and time, living requires money. 

We have an incredibly unequal and oversubscribed culture and moving out of the country isn’t an option. 

I am very weary of life. There is no legalised rational euthanasia law here that I can take comfort in (you know, if push comes to shove).

I do intellectually believe in Post Scarcity, Transhumanist, technological Singularity which could ease life for everyone on the planet, but that’s too far out in the future to derive any comfort in. 

I’ll do what I am doing, live in rent wherever I am living till I can. 

But I things do not work out I need an out.

Is there a place - a monastery, an ashram, a commune something - where I can live permanently for free with privacy, hygiene, and reasonable comfort? That isn’t very cultish in design and isn’t very theocratic and fanatical?

(I do not own a place, obviously). 

I do not respond well to authority.

I am a productive depressive but endless hoops presented just slays my will a chip at a time. 

If there are better subs to ask this question then I’d be obliged if someone links me to it. 

Naysayers and people asking me to “lighten up”, “chill”, “relax”, “trust”, “believe” could save themselves the trouble of commenting. (Respectfully)

5701,"Did Mumbai smell LPG last night? - A brief write-up about the whys and the wherefores of the incident**Correction : Did Mumbai smell PNG last night?**

[Ofcourse LPG/PNG are odourless. It is the ethyl mercaptan which is mixed with them, that helps us identify a leak]~


* On the evening of 19th Sept 2019, panic started spreading among residents of Mumbai. What people initially thought, was their own/neighbour's PNG line leaking, turned out to be something bigger. Because the odour was not localised to one single house/apartment. It was observed in many areas spread across western to eastern mumbai

* Many residents were now on twitter, talking about what was happening on their end. 

* Complaints were coming in from areas like Chembur, Mankhurd, Govandi, Chandivali, Powai, Ghatkopar, Santacruz and Andheri (to name a few?)

* BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) said they were looking into the leak and had taken counter measures like deploying FireEngines and other emergency rescue vehicles.

* Unverified(without source) reports started flowing in saying BMC declared the leak was from RCF (Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers), which RCF categorically denied ( [RCF Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/rcfkisanmanch) - they tweeted their statement late this morning. Which I found idiotic. It should have been done last evening, if infact there was no leak at their end)

* Much to the surprise of residents, BMC even said the gas leak could have come from a moving vehicle. 

* Mahanagar gas limited, which provides piped LPG connection in Mumbai, also denied any leak.

* Mumbai police handle did not put out any statement (as of late last night).

* Now, the morning after the incident, no adverse effects/injuries/deaths/destruction to property reported so far. So that is good. 



**Question of the hour** - What was the source? BMC is still looking for an answer.

I came across two tweets, which spoke about the possible sources.

1. Algal bloom - toxic accumulation of algae in fresh and salt water sources. It kills marine life along with strong odour sometimes. The low pressure area around arabian sea, resulting in movement of wind, must have brought the odour into the city.

2. The garbage dump at Mankhurd (deonar dumping ground, infamous for having caught on fire in 2016), while decomposing, must have emanated methane (odourless) / hydrogen sulfide / ammonia.




**The leak, if LPG(possibility of which is NIL, since no explosion was reported anywhere), would have caused massive deaths and damages by now. There have been similar incidents in India and abroad** - 

[**2014_GAIL_pipeline_explosion**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_GAIL_pipeline_explosion) - 22 dead, 30 injured. Location - Nagaram in Andhrapradesh.

>On 27 June 2014 a massive fire broke out following a blast in Gas Authority of India Limited (GAIL) 18"" size underground gas Pipeline at Nagaram, East Godavari districtin East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh, India. The accident took place near Tatipaka refinery of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), about 180 km from state capital Vijayawada.

>State Finance Minister Yanamala Rama Krishnudu told reporters that 22 people were killed and many others were injured when the fire broke out around 5.30 a.m. in Nagaram village in Mamidikuduru mandal of the coastal district. The minister said: ""The fire caused massive losses. Coconut trees, other crops, cattle and wild birds in over 10 acres were reduced to ashes.""


[**2014_Kaohsiung_gas_explosions wiki link**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kaohsiung_gas_explosions) - 32 dead, 321 injured. Location - Taiwan. 

>Eyewitnesses reported a smell of gas and white smoke coming out of manholes near Kaisyuan 3rd Road and Ersheng 1st Road in Cianjhen District on 31 July 2014 at 20:46, over three hours prior to the incident. The explosions occurred later at 23:57 on Yisin Road, Ersheng Road, Sanduo Road and Guanghua Road.

>Witnesses reported seeing fireballs soaring into the sky and flames reaching 15 stories high. The blasts ripped up roads, trapped and overturned cars and firetrucks, and caused a blackout to the electrical grid. About 6 km of road length were damaged. The explosions reportedly blew cars and motorcycles high up in the air; some vehicles and victims were found at the rooftops of buildings three or four stories high. One street had been split along its length, swallowing fire trucks and other vehicles.

>Premier Jiang Yi-huah stated that there had been at least five blasts around the city. The blasts cut gas supplies to 23,600 households, electricity to 12,000 households, and water to 8,000 households.

>Firefighters from Kaohsiung City, Chiayi City, Pingtung County, Tainan City and Taitung County rushed to the scene to extinguish the fires and help the rescue efforts. Some of the firefighters also sprayed water on the roads in the hope to reduce the ground temperature. During the incident, four firefighters lost their lives, with two of them going missing; the explosions also injured 22 other emergency workers. The Taiwanese army was also dispatched and arrived at the site within two hours after the initial explosion.

>Emergency rooms in hospitals around Kaohsiung were packed with casualties that night, with most of them having suffered cuts and burns. Some of the injured people had to be carried to hospitals by trucks due to the lack of ambulances. All of the casualties were sent to more than 20 hospitals around the city, including Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Yuan's General Hospital, Armed Forces General Hospital, and Kaohsiung Municipal United Hospitals.

5702,"Rant of my broken heartCurrent state of society and polity is making me sick. Every evening, my father watches Zee News. I mostly stay away in my room. But for past few days I'm on a trip with family and staying in a hotel. So I'm in awkward situation to overhear Zee news while my father watches. TBH my father subscribes to Hindutva and Nationalism since his 20s I guess—when BJP was non existent.

Now to my point, for past three days Zee news is airing same program of Modi's Houston visit ""Howdy Modi"" for 1 hour I guess. Then next program is Babul Supriyo incident in Jadhavpur University. Sudhir states that, Union Minister's life was in danger and anything could have happened. Basically he was saying that Babul Supriyo could have been Lynched. Then he defames the university and students for another 30 minutes. And he didn't ever mention of the case Zee news in involved in after faking the anti-national chants in JNU. I mean every week many are getting lynched, some girl's rape case involving former minister surfaced and Zee didn't even mention it let alone allocating a whole hour. Moreover, in the whole program there was a subtextual reference of Pakistan, of course.

This all makes me sick. The hypocrisy and the ignorance towards the issues of common citizen. In the words of Ravish Kumar, ""Gareeb log barbaad ho raha hai"".  Gareeb log chodo middle class bhi gareeb ho raha. There are droughts, floods, farmer suicides (with no data being released since 2016), unemployed youth, among many other issues ailing this society. We think of these as numbers. But every number has a name and many other names who depend on that one name for food on their table. Think about your family member committing suicide because they can't put food on table. Think about your sibling or yourself struggling to get a job for years now. When will we realize that no politician or party is going to helps. We need to help ourselves.

The problem in my opinion is that people don't recognise that even a Prime Minister is just doing his job like our father, mother or anyone else we know. He's not supposed to tell the history of our nation in a rally or tell you what  kind and degree of economic and social development our nation needs. Citizens should know this for themselves, by reading about and understanding their history culture and social background and then decide for themselves what they as an Individual and and their nation as an whole does need. Then they should vote whoever candidate resembles closest to their aspirations while also considering if your choice would hurt other people's aspirations or life. This called ethical and informed voting. And it is far different from most people do. They just watch news channels and make their choices by seeing what news channels show them. This encourages Politicians to hijack news channels, called embedded journalism, and thus hijack your choice and brain. That's people call a bhakt. But I don't think they're bhakt. They are just not aware enough about the society and nation in which they live.

Update: I think people are getting it wrong. It's not a rant about my dad's views in particular. It's about letting everyone know that no Party or Leader (be if INC, BJP, TMC etc.) has an intent to help uplift Indians. They all have selfish agenda and citizens should vote in such a way that they are forced to help India and Indians develop in order to fulfill their own wishes.",1568997467.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,21,102

5704,"The true purpose of reservations in India is not economic upliftment, but social inclusion. ***For the record, I am a Brahmin (I don't see myself as one. It is merely the word that I use when I fill out any Government form that asks me the question) and I have, in no way, benefited from reservations or affirmative action.***

Reservations in India is a fraught topic and tends to divide people like no other topic does. The vast majority of the upper castes blame reservations for India's inefficient Governance and subsequent lack of opportunities. Many others think it is meant to provide economic upliftment to the so-called depressed classes who have been at the receiving end of the caste pyramid for centuries. Others describe it as a necessary evil that does more good than harm. I take objection to this description of reservation as a ""*necessary evil*"" and as a means of economic upliftment. It is not evil and it is necessary. It does not seek to economically uplift the depressed classes. I will now demonstrate why.

Reservations for the depressed classes (scheduled castes or scheduled tribes and so on and so forth) have been a feature of politics, education and employment opportunities in Independent India. The policy aims to reserve a portion of seats in educational institutions, employment opportunities in Government run organisations and in electoral constituencies for those candidates who are identified to be part of the above mentioned communities. These communities have historically been marginalised and have been downtrodden for millennia. In the case of the Scheduled Tribes (or STs), their predilection to residing in the forests and the remote hinterlands of the Indian sub continent has ensured that they remained outside the purview of mainstream society and thus bereft of the opportunities that are provided by being part of the villages and cities and so on. The tribes of India are for the most part, hunter gatherers living in the remote jungle (such as the Bhils, Gonds and Santhals), or nomadic herders in nature, living with their livestock and migrating from one place to another in search of pasture (such as the Gujjars in some states, though their status as an ST is debatable). Many of these tribes lived only on the margins of human settlements in India and were viewed with hostility and suspicion by most people. The British criminalised many of them by instituting an act called the Criminal Tribes act. Entire communities were criminalised and those who were on the margins of society were further outcast. These communities neither had a say nor were given any kind of justice when their resources (such as forest produce, or land that has historically belonged to them) were extracted (or plundered, if you think that way) by the Government of India in the name of the People of India. Their woman and children have been exploited when they venture out of their remote domains. They have forever been on the margins of society, physically and socially, and have had no voice in the debates of modern India, a country that now counts them as its citizens.

The Scheduled Castes (or SCs) have been treated worse. These communities were classified as social outcasts and were often forced to live outside the village. They weren't allowed to draw water from the same well as the rest of the village, they weren't allowed to visit the temple or take part in the communal activities such as festivals or decision making. They provided an important source of agricultural labour in villages (and still do) and performed menial jobs in the cities that were ritually considered impure or dirty. The agricultural economy would collapse if their labour was not available and sanitation would have been non-existent in the cities without the *Dalits* to clean the toilets and clear the corpses. And yet, they were not part of the conversation when it came to society. They have never had a voice, a say in the decisions that are made when the community gets together and makes a collective decision. They have been exploited physically, economically, and socially by all and sundry. Their status has been little better than slaves. They are an important part of Indian society but have little to no say in the affairs of the country or the state, and yet they are counted as citizens of India.

Why am I telling you so much about how these communities have been excluded over thousands of years? Because reservation is not a policy that primarily seeks to economically uplift communities and give them education and jobs. The purpose of reservation is not economic upliftment but ***social inclusion*** within the mainstream of society, in effect giving them a say in governance and a voice in society. Reservation aims to bring these communities into the social mainstream so that they become part of the conversation and are able to participate fully in society (In politics, in our educational institutions, in employment, in decision making capacities and so on). Without affirmative action policies such as reservation, these communities will forever be marginalised on the outskirts of society. They will be denied a voice and denied opportunities to advance, and denied the right to be treated with dignity as Humans. The harm done to these communities by centuries of prejudice has hardly begun to be redressed by the policies of Independent India. 

It is highly unfortunate that the original purpose of reservation has been warped in such a manner that all and sundry (I am looking at the OBCs and those who advocate reservations for economically weaker sections among the upper castes now) are demanding reservations. Reservation is not about economic opportunity. It is about social justice, and economic opportunity is a by product of social opportunity. Until such a time arrives when these communities are afforded the same social opportunities as the rest of society and are not excluded, reservations are a necessity in India. It is ***not*** a necessary evil. It is ***not*** an evil at all. It is justice.",1568987935.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,54,136

There are clear and abundant examples of what happens around the world when corp tax rates are decreased without a simultaneous effort to tackle the underlying problems of a stuttering economy.

Where the protagonist John Abraham plays K yep just 'K'.  Our protagonist is a chainsmoker who thinks of smoking as a kind of expression but also is someone who doesn't question things, yep like the political situation. He just goes woth the flow and the climax is his two fingers or index and middle are chopped off which he used for smoking and he's in a fire chamber just like the gas chambers used during the holocaust. So any other though provoking movie's or suggestions would be a welcome, and hope we'd have a healthy discourse.

5904,"Aryan Immigration (probably Invasion) theory - a conclusive argumentLet this thread be the exhaustive list of arguments for or against Aryan Immigration (probably Invasion) theory with an authoritative conclusion, whenceforth, no further dispute will be entertained until a newer research comes out.

For:

The recent research on *The formation of human populations in South and Central Asia*, by Narasimhan *et al* has concluded that:

>Steppe ancestry in modern South Asians is primarily from males and **disproportionately high in Brahmin and Bhumihar groups**. Most of the Steppe ancestry in South Asia **derives from males**, pointing to **asymmetric social interaction** between descendants of Steppe pastoralists and peoples of the Indus Periphery Cline. Groups that view themselves as being of traditionally priestly status, including Brahmins who are traditional custodians of liturgical texts in the early Indo-European language Sanskrit, tend (with exceptions) to have more Steppe ancestry than expected on the basis of ANI-ASI mixture, **providing an independent line of evidence for a Steppe origin for South Asia’s Indo-European** languages.   [https://imgur.com/a/1jQagqc](https://imgur.com/a/1jQagqc)  [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487.full](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/365/6457/eaat7487.full)

Having established that steppe pastorals are not the earliest to arrive in india, and that they had 'assymetrical social interation' with the existing locals, we can conclude that the nature of migration was '**hostile**'. Fully fledged '**Invasion**' can be inferred from vedas:

>For fear of thee forth **fled the dark-hued races**, scattered abroad, deserting their possessions,When, glowing, O Vaiśvānara, for Pūru, thou Agni **didst light up and rend their castles**. - [RV Book 7, Hymn 5, Verse 3](https://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/rigveda/rv07005.htm)

EDIT 1:

>Altogether, therefore, the recently refined Y-chromosome tree strongly suggests that R1a is indeed a highly **plausible marker for the long-contested Bronze Age spread of Indo-Aryan speakers** into South Asia, although dated aDNA evidence will be needed for a precise estimate of its arrival  
>  
>\- \[[Silva et al](https://rdcu.be/bRs8W)\]

Is it not as bad as we think and in future, we'll dust it as a blot on a paper or BJP has affected the fundamental fabric of the nation? We know for sure that opposition leaders aren't being arrested blatantly as in Emergency, but I also feel like this is kind of soft emergency which none of the countries haven't evolved enough to deal with.

Simply telling an authentic Indian story or chronicling times in a way that remains compelling through the years such as Garam Hava, Mother India, Haider, Shatranj ke Khiladi, Manto 

Remains charming or emotive such as Anand, Andaz Apna Apna, Dev D, Sholay 

Enduring social message such as Dangal, Taare Zameen Par, Queen 

Or setting a technical benchmark such as Lagaan, Uri, Tumbbad 

All the above movies are 'classics' of course, purely in my humble opinion. 

Also, unfortunately I have very limited exposure to regional cinema but again from the ones that I have seen, the ones that I feel would be classics are: 

Marathi: Natrang, Shwaas, Court, Natsamrat, Tukaram, Sairat

Telugu: Baahubali, Bommarillu 

Tamil: Bombay, Nayakan

5956,"Update on events at Jadavpur University so far today Update on events at JU so far today (as gathered via those on the ground who are not in a space to be able to do this):

ABVP-BJP-RSS have broken Gate 4, and set it on fire along with the board that has the university's name and logo on it and other notice boards. The gates were closed to prevent them from coming in and they broke through. They were carrying trishuls, rods, tubelights, firearms etc. A loaded chamber was found lying on the ground, which, they claimed happened because the safety lock wasn't on. Anyone could have been shot today because they were careless. They've broken and set fire to the union room and all the furniture in it and thrown ACID BULBS inside campus. Tarit-da's stationery shop has also been hit badly. Hara-da's shop as well. They have both managed to escape relatively unscathed, as has Bhoothnath-da, from what I hear.

Babul Supriyo and his goons hit students earlier today. One is hospitalised, countless injured. The student body demanded that wouldn't be allowed to leave until he apologises. He refused to do anything of the sort and his party's goons have been breaking our campus by vandalising every building and department they can lay their hands on, trapping students within them and cutting off the power supply and effectively restricting access to the campus to relief services like the medical and fire safety department.

NOTE: There was NO gherao at any point today.

There was a human chain barricade which the Governor was allowed to walk through as he went in and ""rescued"" Babul Supriyo. When the VC went in earlier to speak to Babul Supriyo and escort him out safely he was rebuked and insulted by Babul Supriyo and eventually fell in the crowd and got injured. He has been hospitalised.

Babul Supriyo refused to move, to apologise to the students for the entire time. Instead he has constantly provocated students by shouting about ""democratic ideals"", the NRC (??!), obscenities and slut shaming female students for the length of their shirts while his guards and ABVP's goons have mercilessly beaten up students indiscriminately with their sticks, bricks and whatnot.

Our campus is in flames. And for no fault of our own. We don't have news on everyone and whatever we do have is coming out in fits and starts via whatsapp and facebook. Someone from CL PG 1 has been seriously injured by a brick that was thrown at him. There's a video going around of him giving an interview (even before any medical attention could reach him), to one of the channels of the Times network detailing who did what to him, dropping the names of BJP and ABVP. You will probably not see this on your TV screens.

The news being broadcast on national media has already has already started twisting and turning these truths to demonise the students (buzzwords like ""pro-Naxal students supporting azadi in Kashmir"" / ""Maoist aka Fascist"" are already being thrown around on Twitter by right-wing ideologues) and make victims out of Honourable MP Babul Supriyo and his men.

This propaganda machine is already in force. Just heard that female student who went to get money out of an ATM at 8B and was cornered by a mob of women who took away her phone etc. and made her apologise on video about the day's proceedings.

Why indeed was a member of parliament packing such heat and accompanied by such a large contingent of such violent manpower if he was originally there for innocent reasons?

The students of Jadavpur (and this was an open body of students from all streams, departments, batches, not all of whom were necessarily card-carrying members of the political parties on campus) have done nothing but engage in peaceful sloganeering and protest.

Many other students are still trapped in the carnage that is still going on in campus right now, without electricity or any respite. There are all kinds of rumors flying around about who or what the next wave of attacks is going to comprise of.


None of this will be forgotten.

Edit: Imgur was not working properly. So I had to use an alternative. I hope it's allowed. Here are [the pictures](https://postimg.cc/gallery/2ooid3qu2/f0c6dc74/). And sharing the videos are a little tricky since they are mostly in the form of Facebook uploads. I can DM the links for the people interested.

Edit Edit: I have found an India Today coverage that shows the students' side of the issue. Here's the [video](https://streamable.com/skhtz) of it.

The top import of India is petroleum, there has been a push for all electric vehicles and even tax cuts to promote the same. This would lead to decreased imports hence improving the economy. 
Another thing is the NRC which are being compared to concentration camps! Non registered people are essentially draining the resources! And I don't understand how  taking a step in this direction is in anyway wrong!

6267,"[RANT] How do you deal with the daily frustrations of living in India? I just want to give up and leave. I made a huge mistake moving back to India.These are my experiences and advice for any NRIs or OCIs who've drunk the cool-aid and believe the lies that Mudi peddles while abroad. The india of your dreams does not exist. It never did. You'll perpetually be disappointed when it comes to India. Outside of a very tiny bubble, India is a festering shithole. The masses is India get to decide how India will progress or regress, not the educated and affluent urban elite. Your voice will just get completely drowned out. The benefit of being part of this elite is you don't have to experience the shithole-ness of India for the most part. 

India is for the most part a festering shithole. If you are an NRI or a member of the privileged Indian community it is possible to live in a mostly insulated bubble where you can separate yourself from the stench (which is true for any 3rd world country to be honest).

But I think it's important to recognize the rot, the ground reality of India. Unfortunately most of the people who live in a bubble seem to think India is doing just great, and there are people who just don't have any exposure to the developed world to realize how bad things really are on the ground.

A lot of people seem to think corruption is a problem that can be fixed by just going after big ticket scams and prosecuting a handful of individuals in politics involved. The reality is corruption is endemic and most systems are completely broken. Corruption exists at every single level in almost every single industry and sphere or life in India. There just isn't any easy fix to the level of dysfunction India has, I suppose some smug idiots want to feel better about themselves by saying #IndiaSuperpower2030 and the like.

A few days ago I stumbled on a comment elsewhere on this website where someone mentioned the cold reality that Indian women are at the highest risk of getting burned alive in the entire world. Yet another Indianism that even I never really though too much about. A few years ago I learned about the open defecation problem.

I saw a comment the other day about marital rape (which still isn't illegal by the way) with a meme comment about open defecation. What meme'ers don't realize is that India is such a cesspit that women are actually at a risk of rape because of open defecation. Let the implications of that sink in for a moment.

The social rot and dysfunction in India is just unending, so maybe people just want to bury their heads in the sand and carry on as if everything is okay. India as a whole isn't going to change any time soon.

Yep, you can regularly see people going on a rampage with vandalism and murder. Sometimes it escalates into full blown riots with mass killings and mass rapes. A godman gets convicted for rape and these subhuman apes go on rampage to defend a rapist and murderer. This is the reality of India.

You can try to rub this sort of thing into the face of deluded Indian nationalists, but honestly even that is a waste of time. Honor-based ethno-religious chauvinism in India is very strong, and this too won't change. They'll bitch about you being racist of course the reality is that their honor is being undermined.

There are some very simple things that can tell you what India is about:

1. The traffic. Everything about traffic in India screams a total disregard for fellow citizens, disregard for rules and orderliness, and a total lack of civic sense. Indian roads, speed bumps and the moronic use of police barricades (presumably to make collecting bribes easier).
2. Filth, littering and sanitation. Probably the less said the better. Not even going into the topic of open defecation, just look at littering in privileged neighborhoods and how nobody bothers to clean up after themselves in malls.
3. Coins being the same size. Something so simple, yet it tells so much. [A tourist visiting India commented about this at the end of his video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPne-q4ynts)
4. Water from taps is unfit for human consumption. Probably the easiest sign that you're in a shithole.
5. Milk is not safe. Food in general is not safe in India - you can fall ill and government health inspectors are a joke.

Indians still seem to live in the pre-independence era, where they were treated as second-class citizens who had no right to complain, and had to yield to the whims of their masters, the British. Common citizens are treated like dogs both by companies and by the government, and they accept it with no compunction.

Yes indeed. Much of India still lives in the middle ages - a feudal, regressive, tribalistic society where concepts like human rights, justice, equality, protecting the most vulnerable citizens and democracy are all mostly irrelevant. What matters is the honor of the tribe - tribe in India's case consists of community, ethnic/linguistic group, caste, religion and region. As long as this honor is not hurt everything is permissable. This is why India is the honor killing capital of the world.


I moved back earlier this year. It was extraordinarily painful - like a crash landing into an alternate reality. Don't let anyone fool you into moving back by talking about spirituality, humanity and the fun you'll have by being with friends and family again. Unless you are very wealthy (and often not even then) and extremely well networked, everyday life in India can be very hard, in ways you cannot visualize. Things barely work. Get ready for incessant powercuts in the peak of blistering summers, unless you can shell out the five lakhs or so for a powerful generator. Banks services, government services, paying your bills, buying groceries, traveling the shortest distances, trying to get your kids into a halfway decent school, finding a service of any kind - in other words, every day normal activities - are all activities fraught with uncertainty and the prospect of being cheated or asked for bribes. Don't even get me started on the filth. It's everywhere, and no one cares. Everyone adds to it with merry abandon. Waste collection and disposal is dismal, even in nicer neighborhoods. The rivers and waterways are dying, choked with filth and industrial effluents.

There is tremendous competition for resources, for jobs, for everything. I mean, life-and-death-type competitiveness. Because, sadly, this is a country where your life literally depends on whether you can cut some other poor sod out of the running. You could be a nuclear scientist super specializing in building deep sea reactors, and you will still have to compete with 300-400 candidates (minimum) for a lousy job. And the one with the best political approach wins.

Even with all this, the worst perhaps is the ugly attitudes of people. The caste system, raises its ugly head in thousands of big and small ways. The class system pretty much dictates how you will be treated. Elite Indians have no respect or time for someone without visible wealth and status. If you don't have a good amount of money, get used to people treating you like crap, stonewalling, being cold, malicious or utterly indifferent. The elite classes in India really occupy their own physical and mind space, in which ordinary people do not impinge.

People don't respect the concept of personal space. At all. Insofar as a queue forms for anything, don't be too startled if people are stuck to you like glue. If you ask the person behind you to take a step back, you'll get a glare and a look that says 'This person is crazy. What the hell do they mean step back!' They may even start fighting with you. There is no concept of privacy.

There are large swathes of India that are not safe for women. So if you like to go out with friends in the evening, as all normal humans do, this is a huge factor for concern.

We won't talk about pollution today. That's a topic for a different rant. But know this - if you suffer from any kind of respiratory illness, urban India is not the place for you.

I also suggest you take a long holiday in India, i.e. live like a local for six months. It'll cure you good.

Totally fucking disgusted. The system in this entire fucking country is designed to hinder progress and frustrate the living fuck out of anyone.

I can't wait to leave. What a shithole.

6288,"Words of Freedom by Bhagat Singh: Book Review&#x200B;

The book would also serve a very good means of waking us up to the  realities of our nation. Have we in all these years proven the sacrifice  of our freedom-fighters worth the efforts? Are we doing something for a  better future of our nation? Or are we still stuck in the webs of  religion, caste or location, which divide us and make us weak? In these  pages, Bagat Singh puts his views very strongly. He also challenges  those (Congress members) who were apparently soft on the British  policies and believed in small incremental gains towards the freedom.  His ideas on religion are also very strong and provocative, but  well-grounded. Here is a sample of some lines from the first article: 

**“While we Indians, what are we doing? A branch of a peepal tree is  cut and religious feelings of the Hindus are injured. A corner of a  paper idol,** ***tazia*****, of the idol-breaker Mohammedans is broken,  and ‘Allah’ gets enraged, who cannot be satisfied with anything less  than the blood of the infidel Hindus.” (P-7)** 

**“The conservativeness and orthodoxy of the Hindus,  extra-territorialism and fanaticism of the Mohammedans and  narrow-mindedness of all the communities in general are always exploited  by the foreign enemy.” (P-9)** 

**“We want people who may be prepared to fight without hope, without  fear and without hesitation, and who may be willing to die un-honored,  unwept and unsung.” (P-10)** 

(From manifesto of The Naujawan Bharat Sabha, founded by Bhagat Singh in 1926 in Lahore) 

(I think his idea of freedom-fighters to be ready to fight even  without hope points to the eternal teaching of Lord Krishna in Gita. Although he was atheist he used to carry small Gita and Biography of Swami Vivekanada)  

Reading Bhagat Singh’s letters and speeches to the British, I  couldn’t stay without being in awe of his intellect and brilliance! I  think if the British gave him a fair trial, he would have got himself  free, given the way he explained the matters and debated in the court.  But alas, the British were bent on hanging him and ignored crucial  evidence and facts, and went about their own determined ways. Bhagat  Singh asked to be shot dead by a gun rather than being hanged, but no  surprise that the British didn’t want to grant him his last wish too. 

Sardar Bhagat Singh’s story is worth being read, told and sung with  all our heart, until each Indian counts one’s nation above one’s other  priorities. It also points towards self-reflection to the communities  who count some other nations and their foreign beliefs above our nation,  or those Indians who harm our nation’s prospects in the name of  business and trade.

I was outside at the time and asked her to contact me later. So she called me again today. When I asked her where she got my number from, she is not replying. On repeatedly asking, she said some database (but was very vague about it). I started asking her multiple questions about the disease and treatment and all she said she will send me pictures and documents about it, but was once again, very vague. On asking her more questions about the hospital, she kept saying they are legit and the child needs help. When I bluffed and said that since I am a journalist, let me do some background check and get back to you, she sounded a little concerned and said okay and asked me to call back when I can.

Now I have been doing some research and found a website and all for this, but there is absolutely no buzz on the thing they want to the fact that it seems made up. I found something about the child she mentioned and apparently the surgery was scheduled for yesterday, so dunno why she is calling me today also. I found a similar letter of appeal from the doctor she mentioned by name, but for another child. I don't know, a lot of things about this whole thing seem fishy.

1- quit job and prepare for govt sector jobs . Ideas of govt job keeps attracting me . I don’t like uncertainty and long work hours of private sector . But the competition keeps holding me back . I am scared of not being able to do anything in 2 -3 years and then starting life again from scratch . 

2- Continue in IT sector - I don’t like constant upskilling , long work hours and unpredictable life here . Although I can upskill right now when I am young what about when I get old  and become expensive 

3- Opt for masters and try to settle abroad - This option will put a dent in my family finances for sure and I will have to take a loan . 

4- MBA . I am confident I can get a good B school for sure but not IIM  definitely not old ones due to score in 12th . I don’t like how bad reputation is of MBA . Everybody says they just teach common sense and how to bullshit . On top of that it’s expensive. I will be spending 15 plus lakhs for sure .",1568908982.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,46,27

6355,"Future of the EconomyFor starters, I want to be clear that I don't have any profession knowledge of economics after 12th grade CBSE. But whatever I say, has been admitted by renowned economists around India both in the opposition and the government. If we compare the current economy of India to that of 1967, we find that there are shocking similarities, the agriculture sector is suffering, manufacturing industries both small and medium scale are running out of funds, the tertiary sector has an acute imbalance towards production and employment. This frightens me because we all know what Indira Gandhi resorted to, when the economy crashed around that time. I just want all of your thoughts on whether this comparison is accurate or not and if it is, then how will it all play out and what all can we do.

6366,"TIL that Indira Gandhi buried a time capsule in 1973 called KaalPatra in Red Fort complex.The government was keen on documenting the first 25 years of the country — its developments, struggles — in the [capsule](https://smedia2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/1977December/india-650_032615044652.jpg). 
It also wanted to manuscript important events in history, along with contemporary achievements. Time frame of the capsule was 1000 years. 

Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR) was given the task of drawing out significant happenings from the past. A professor of History from Madras Christian College, S Krishnawamy, was to get the manuscript ready.

The manuscript was believed to be misinterpreting historical facts and it was believed that the whole exercise of planting the time capsule was Gandhi’s way of exalting her and her father JLN's stature while simultaneously undermining efforts of other leaders in nation building.

The capsule was finally dug out by Janata Party government in 1977. It's contents were never revealed to the public.

In 2013, in response to a RTI petition, PMO informed that it has no records of the infamous time capsule.

6578,"Why shouldn't we buy expensive smartphones.An Economic Analysis

The costliest phone in the US costs 1000$ but some variants exceed that limit.

Let us assume that the normal flagship phone price be around 900$ which everybody buy. These are also subsidised by the carriers in the US.

Purchase Power Parity says that the purchase power of Indians is about 17.5 Rupees to a dollar. Which means something which is expected to cost a dollar in the US, should cost 17.5 Rupees in India. This is computed through taking in costs of food items and other basic amenities.
70/17.5=4
Which means that the cost of living in the US is about 4 times that of India. This gives a rough idea about local salaries, rents, etc.

Now, if a US citizen is paying at most 1100$, this should mean we should not be ready to pay 275$. I understand the cost of technology really depends on the material and labor cost, as well as the R&D which is done in the US. So the phone costs same everywhere (except the taxes) and this is not a rant on phonemaker's cost. Rather, it is a rant about us overspending.

Now the US prices are tax exclusive, I will add 15% buffer and 15% more for cushion. This works out to 32.25%.
All of this works to about 364$ or about Rupees 25.4k.

Now, there are many assumptions I took. The tax bracket of 15% is quite high. 1100$ is also a high assumption. 15% cushion might be low.
All in all, 20-26k range could be assumed.

I am not saying anybody paying more is an idiot. If they want the best, and have money to spare, good for them. What concerns me more is the amount people are shelling out for smartphones, and don't even earn that much. Especially with smartphones not getting outdated for more than 4 years now, and with companies like Xiaomi, cheaper phones are getting better. My Mi 3 lasted for 4 years and it was bought in 2014. I can only assume that smartphones these days are more futureproof.
My mom's iPhone 6S Plus is a 5 year old model, which works flawlessly.

An average user buying iPhone has INR 9.5 lakhs salary as per Purchase Power in the US as per some report (I will link if you want).
This will also include shit heads who buy it while being poor, and crazy rich.

Maybe we can save money elsewhere or upgrade late. It's tough these days, with crazy marketing and new phones coming out every week.",1568830015.0,#ffb000,Business/Finance,dark,51,45

6582,"I am in a fixI am father of 2 kids, one son(12) and a daughter(9). We live in a joint family, with my mother and father(he is in a govt. job, and stay away in a stretch for months). Me (Businessman) and my wife(Teacher) are working and stay most of the day at our work places. These days the exams of my kids are going on, due to this they come early than my wife from school. Somehow my mother abused and kicked my son, today. I know these kids become pain in ass sometimes, but still they are kids. My son have written a letter to me in this regard, naturally, my wife is angry too. My kids told me , the moment they are alone with her(my mother), she does a volte face, and becomes harsh with them. These things have happen before, but I never talked with her. I fear, if I raise this with my mother, she will deny and start tantrums like not eating food, not talking to kids, keep sulking and other small things.This will lead to toxic environment in our home. My mother is very immature in attitude, can pick a fight any time. Today when she was shouting at my son, he hide under the table, at that time she kicked him. This is hurting me, and more over I am unable to think clearly. My father will take side of my mother, if I talk to him. My brother( he lives in same city but separately), I can't think how will he react, if I discuss with him. I am not depended on my parents, but I don't want to leave them. How to approach my mother, and what are the options I have?. Please help me to handle this situation.",1568822362.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,41,60

6585,"Do we seriously have the time and an economic backup for a war?Many news channels and BJP leaders have been beating the drums to ""reoccupy"" POK. Pakistan is not going to hand it over to us ofc. So will there be a war?


Seeing the economic status of our country was it wise to integrate Kashmir ? Which as we know was done by force and against the will of kashmiris through so many lies spread across the campaign and implementation.


Now as occupying Pok is the next agenda, on what bedrock presuppositions is India moving so comfortably knowing it fill further impact the state of the present economy and bring instability and insanity amongst its own citizens?

Don't misquote me I have full faith in the Army, but is it the right time? 

Will the development in kashmir ever occur? Will companies ditch bright budding states like the ones in South and pounce in Kashmir? 


The governor of J&K came out and said that modi told him to develop kashmir to such an extent that the other side would willingly want to join India without a war.


Aren't these white lies so easy to spot? Why does the media think they can easily fool us? Doesn't it show how the current media views the nation thinking it can woefully delude us with lies ? 


Even after subramaniam swamy comes out in offense, tweets , speaks on Quint and other sources about the downfall, the minister of defense now hopes for a 10 trillion dollar economy?

Work life balance and 4. so that I can work o my hobbies viz ekectric guitar, photography and travelling

The government exams which I think tick the boxes for me is IAS, solely ( Though I will sacrifice my hobbies for that obviously as the responsibility would be much greater in magnitude). The backups which I think would work well are

1. UPSC CSE( IRS , specifically because it is all in all a desk job in my estimation, also is a great backup if I attemp the CSE again the subsequent year)
2. UPSC IFoS, for obvious reasons
3. SSC CGL( I have heard ministry of external affairs department has a few desk jobs. Also, ASO)
4. RBI Grade B, I heard that bank exams are mostly riddled with casteist policies such as late promotions and the like

What do you suggest? I have an aptitude for the social science subjects in general and psychology, philosophy in particular. In addition to that, I like to think that I am fairly decent in analytical reasoning and the rest of aptitude reasoning tests and even if I wasnt I could well develop and sharpen them as I still have two more years",1568802294.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,1,7

This incident brought up a few questions in my mind regarding the physical fitness test for government/private jobs.

1. What if I was diagnosed with a much severe or a chronic condition, does that mean I can't apply for a job anymore?

2. What if i had no idea I had such a condition but found out during the fitness test?

6876,"What are the most needed reforms for India?When I see around myself,I find that people are going through worse problems which are ignored by our government/Society. 
I.E. Domestic violence and parents who beat their children till they pass out.
There's laws for those problems but needed to reform in some ways too 



I mean we all are trending big issues and cheering when it gets solved but what I do think is there's reform needed in small scale level too which actually can change our lives.
I.e. I'm not a bit against discrimination of 370 (and I totally support it) But It won't affect our daily life that much (Maybe in future but not as much as Strict law or something concrete against domestic violence and all stuff)  



We should care and debate about big issues but we should also think about other reforms which are underated but we actually need them. 

On 5th September everyone remembers teachers and all, Politicians talks about how they're important for society but when it comes to salary, I've seen teachers who gets <5K , Some schools are appointing undergrad as teachers! What they'll teach our children. I guess end of day it'll be more harmful then not learning some specific language. 


So What are the most needed reforms for India but it's getting ignored?

6879,"Thoughts on Mi Smart Water PurifierI am about to buy a new water purifier, so far I have not used any water purifier  at home, I get drinking water delivered in cans. 

What is your opinion on buying Mi Smart Purifier? 

These are few issues I have in mind, 
1) The recovery rate is <= 33% (for every 1 liter of drinking water there will be 2 liters of waste water), is this same other brands?

2) I am not  a great fan of smart technology showcased, I might not even use it

3) filter prices 1299/- for PPC Filter, 899/- for PAC filter, and 1799/- RO filter. I am not clear on when will these filters need to be changed, mi did give some approx liters for each filter, but not sure how accurate they are.

4) what about the other parts? If any of other parts like TDS sensor, or UV lamp or some other part fails will it serviced? Will it be at home or should we take it to service center 

5) output rate is .13L/min, making it 7.8ltrs per hour,  where are kent claims it to be 20L/hr

6) I dont have any municipal water connection, will it work well with  bore water, and I am not sure of the value but, in the locality I live in the water is hard water.

7) price wise MI purifier is 11,999/- which approx 40% less than competitors 

8) MI water purifier doesn't have UF, what is the role of UF?

9) attractive thing is the DIY, it is very easy to change filters is the same in others",1568812131.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,10
