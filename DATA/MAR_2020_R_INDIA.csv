Here's what a lockdown means:

You stay at home, and you stay safe.

Here's what a lockdown does NOT mean:

You give a free pass to your government.

&#x200B;

Question, question and question some more. Now is the time to hold the government accountable even more.

Not only for how it's tackling COVID.

But also because the powerful of any sort want you to not pay attention to them or look closely at their actions. Emergency of any sort is a perfect cover for this.

57,"Covid19 in India: Hard times are ahead of us, 3D Printed PPE face sheildsI believe hard times are ahead of us, the numbers on the TV for active Covid19 cases although rising but are still really low compared to what other countries show. Not knowing the real numbers is more scary to be honest. Which means once government starts testing there would be a huge surge in active Covid-19 cases sometime coming week or next week.

I know our PM urges us to stay home, and our managers expect us to sit and WFH but we and including our managers are facing this situation at this scale for the first time. So being techies and young we need to bend the rules a little.
It is time to take a step no matter how small to safeguard our health care force and we can't completely rely on government to take care of that. 

Deep down we know world is going to shit right now and, so will our country and our people.

I am a bit confused on some of the allowances in the offer breakdown - I have been offered a base salary and along with that I get house rent allowance, special allowance, vehicle reimbursement and internet allowance.

1. For house allowance - do I have to submit the rental agreement to the employer to claim it? Or do I have to submit it to someone else i.e. when filing taxes end of year? Does it get deposited as part of salary each month or is that directly given to the landlord?
2. Do I have to do anything to claim the special allowance or is it automatically deposited into the account along with base salary?
3. How do I claim the vehicle and internet allowance - is it similar to housing allowance where it comes in as part of salary or does that go to companies directly?

87,"Why the Tablighi jamaat has less to blame and the Indian state more to blame for the spurt in coronavirus cases due to the congregation than you thinkThe event took place from March 13th to 16th. As of March 13th, there was no information about coronavirus cases being detected from the congregration that took place earlier in Malaysia's Selangor. 

(Source: Google search for ""tablighi+jamaat+coronavirus"" for articles that appeared before March 13th [[link](https://www.google.com/search?q=coronavirus+tablighi+jamaat&tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A%2Ccd_max%3A3%2F16%2F2020)])

It was only by March 16th that information about the cases in Malaysia started pouring in and it was on March 16th that Delhi announced a ban on religious congregations. But by this time, these 3000 odd people had already been assembled in Delhi and come in contact with the international attendees, who presumably had brought the coronavirus. So, it was not criminal negligence or stupidity that made these people have this congregation but, simply, lack of information.

Which now brings me to the second point I want to make. After March 16th, the primary response of Indian state was to enforce the Delhi government's order by getting this congregation to dissipate, which given the information coming from Malaysia was absolutely the incorrect call. All of these people should have been tested for coronavirus and quarantined immediately. Instead, they were forced to return to wherever they came from and two weeks later we are spending our efforts tracing the tracks of all the people who had attended the congregation and all the tens of thousands of people they may have come in contact with during all this time after they left.

In India, as we grow older and start working, we often forget about our old hobbies & the things which we used to enjoy when we were younger. 

This lockdown will last a minimum of 21 days, and everyone needs to find quality activities to fill their schedule with & things to enjoy with their families.

* Home workout tutorials for Cardio, Yoga, Strength, and flexibility.

* Guides and apps for managing anxiety and social isolation

* Community chat to discuss & engage with

* Unbiased, scientific news

* Learning resources

In many publications,even for submitting you have to buy their subscription which costs about $5.Huge competition,I must say.I think,this is one of the few times Google didn't helped me to find what i wanted.

The only option remains survey,which pays extremely shitty pay and is total time waste.I mean finding something which ""pays"" is next to impossible, atleast that's what I see currently. No matter where i try,there is already a crowd out there waiting for any job. Many platforms simply don't pay Indian writers citing that their platform is technologically incapable as of now.They can only pay selected countries writer,as of now.

290,"Vodafone Didn't Provide Me the Talktime Balance As Per the Plan and Now Refusing to Help!On 30th March, I did a recharge of ‚Çπ49 on my Vodafone number, which is supposed to offer ‚Çπ38 secondary talktime balance:

[Plan Details](https://preview.redd.it/acp3kjk606q41.png?width=1060&format=png&auto=webp&s=22a5e96865c12ded7b943d0d5d8aa1c5d7a4d9e0)

&#x200B;

But, I was astonished to see that¬†**no talktime balance was credited to my account!** As you can see, **I have only¬†‚Çπ3.75¬†left in my main account balance**¬†and ‚Çπ0 in my secondary balance instead of ‚Çπ38:

[Balance](https://preview.redd.it/bgjuaphj06q41.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c1e1060aff1890d8d3e2932dc36c30cb2b9f226)

&#x200B;

When I called their 198 support, they informed that they activated certain ""service"" on the same day I did the recharge. But, didn't tell exactly what service despite repeatedly asking them to tell.

When I resisted that I didn't activate any service and asked why it was activated without my consent, they told stubbornly that \*I\* did it and they don't activate any service without the customer's consent. When I asked them to cancel it and refund the money back, they refused and said that it cannot be cancelled because I consented them to activate it.

I wonder why does the service cost exactly ‚Çπ38 and why it was activated the same day I did the recharge! Sounds something is fishy inside the company.

At this point, I thought to email the Appellate authority.

But, as expected, they didn't help either. This was their reply:

[Appellate Helpdesk's Reply](https://preview.redd.it/xn2h8hxk06q41.png?width=1042&format=png&auto=webp&s=50dcf9796515d45739cfb8b85af93d1722cc9bd1)

Yes, this was their reply even after telling everything in detail. They didn't even go through in detail to check *why* it was deducted and how I could be helped.

**It is essentially a fraud,** because they didn't provide the service they intended to provide and now refusing to help me out either. I wonder if due to heavy losses, they want to recover the money by doing frauds like that.

Due to the current crisis, I can't even port out to another operator. So, at this point, I feel really helpless.

I posted it on Twitter, but nobody from their team has reached out to me yet - probably due to the ongoing crisis:

Community groups across the world like OSCMS (Open Source COVID Medical Supplies) which I am a part of are helping people get access to designs. Please share the links in the comments with them so they can get connected!

I'm specifically focused on masks and face shields as they:

A) Decrease community transmission by limiting the amount of virus a sick or asymptomatic person sheds

B) Forces people to be more aware which means they are more likely to follow medical guidelines

C) Gives India more time as India is still (thankfully) at the early stages of mass community transmission and if you care about people you want to make sure we can slow and decrease the amount of destruction this will create!

Medtronic recently made their PB560 mechanical ventilator open source and we were looking to use their design, simplify it and make some very simplified prototypes which could be used in an Indian context. I am an engineer involved in the manufacturing industry with experience in electronics and pneumatics so I think we could potentially do it. Their data dump is still incomplete so I still don't understand it completely and while I now understand how it works, I am still confused by how exactly the controls are being handled. In this context, I have a few questions for doctors who use these ventilators:

1. When supplemental oxygen is used, is the oxygen % set in the ventilator or from the hospital oxygen line?
2. Does anybody have an idea on what is the oxygen pressure in the hospital oxygen line usually?
3. What are the measured feedback values which are absolutely needed? As far as I can see, the Medtronic ventilator measures the patient inspiration pressure, exhalation pressure and inspiration flowrate. Are these sufficient? Are all of them needed - would it be safe to omit any one of them?

449,"An extremely personal rant.I know right now the world is going through a pandemic and this doesn't matter even a tiniest bit but I have no one else to talk to anymore and I just need to get it out. Because it's really fucking with my sanity. It's okay if anyone doesn't want to read this, I just need to get it out. This will be extremely long.

I (27F) have known my best friend H (27M) since I've been 8. I grew up with him. Same school, same friends, same college. We live 5 minutes away from each other. I've always thought of him as a brother. As a matter of fact, all of our friends also viewed us as siblings for all intents and purposes. We have another friend, N (27F) whom we've known for 18 years. H and N are childhood sweethearts. A lovestory made for the movies. Always together, shy glances, understanding each other silences. It was a fairytale.

Unfortunately, they broke up when they turned 18. H carries a lot of abandonment issues because his father was not great and divorced his mom when he was 4 and also because they had to depend on their relatives while he grew up for financial assistance. So he's always had a lot of issues and some of them came into play and they broke up . N started dating another guy for the next 3 years but came back after that to H. They got back together again. 

N's father was not keeping well and she wanted to get married to H before he passed away. H, because of his issues, refused because he didn't think he was financially all that capable of taking care of her and also because he thinks he has nothing to offer her because he has a broken family. He told her that he can't promise her anything right now. N asked if she should wait. H said that he can't ask her to keep her life on hold for him because that wouldn't be right. N then decided to get married to her ex boyfriend .

H was devastated, ofcourse. This was when i was there for him. I was always his constant in all this drama, and he in my life. We've always been there for each other, grounding each other. I gave him a shoulder to crry on. Met him daily. Talked about his feelings. Tried to cheer him up. And in all this, we kissed. It was weird, almost taboo. Because i thought of him as a brother. And we tried to fight it. But it felt right. Maybe for him it was a rebound. I don't know. This happened in 2017. And we kept carrying on and off for all this while. Now we did everything that was possible except have sex. I don't know why we never went there but we just didn't.

In Jan 2019 last year, N came back. She wasn't happy with her husband, said she made a mistake, that she didn't love him. She reconnected with H. H and I, we never were in a relationship. For us, there were no promises or anything . We were friends first and foremost and that is what we wanted to be our entire lives. We thought this thing would probably work itself out of our system in some time. But even after that, we talked daily. Texted all the time. Met 3-4 times a week. So i fell for him. And when N came back and they reconnected, I became possesive.

I asked H if they were in contact and he lied. He lied everytime and i found out the truth everytime. I still kept on giving him chance after chance. But i got severe trust issues. I probably should have left then but that meant having to end not only our relationship but 20 years of friendship and i didn't have the strength to do that. I kept spiralling and checked his phone and he would delete most of his messages but forget to delete call logs and we'd have a fight about that. He kept on lying and lying and my behaviour kept on getting more unhealthy and toxic.

In September last year, he asked for a break. I freaked out. I was already getting bad panic attacks and anxiety at the thought of losing him and i couldnt take the idea that he'd leave. So i chased after him. I told him to please give us another chance, just the friendship. That i dont remember a time in my life when he wasn't there and i dont know how is survive without him. I chased him for 4 months. Called him and begged him and cried and shouted . Nothing wworked. I finally gave up on 31 December. During this while, if i somehow found a way to not contact him for 8-10 days, he would text me himself to ask how i was doing and that moved me back to square one and i started chasing him again. It became a vicious cycle.

During Valentine's, I somehow stopped myself with great difficulty to text him. But he texted me in the evening saying happy valentine's with a heart emoticon. On 15 and 16 Feb, we went to a mutual friends wedding. N was there as well. And i dont know what trip of self destruction i was on, but for the first time in 3 years, i had sex with him that weekend. My first time. I was a virgin. After it was done, i went to the washroom. When i came out, he wasn't there. I looked for him in other rooms where 4-7 of my friends were lazing about. He was on a bed beside N holding her hand. He'd just fucked me not 5 minutes back and here he was on the bed with her holding her hand. I lost it. Complete nervous breakdown. I shouted at him and then 2-3 of our friends came to know that we were together. 
No one had any idea for 3 years. We had promised each other we won't tell anyone, that we'd take it to our graves and i broke his trust. I shouldn't have. People didn't understand. Because we've been saying we were like siblings for 2 decades. For them, it was almost incestuous. H told me that this was the grave of our friendship. That we were over, never to be spoken in the same sentence again. That I'm a bitch, that my depression was an act for sympathy, that I enjoy being unhappy in life and just make everyone around me miserable. I felt horribly guilty. I did t know what to do. I went after him and kept apologising , saying that i fucked up. He got physically aggresive then. Started pushing me very badly because i didnt give him the personal space that he asked for. I probably should have.

I called and texted him for a week after that. I think I'm suicidal. I told him that as well. Told him not to do this to me, not to abandon me. He said he can't help me, that he's sorry but he is going to look after his peace and he's done with me. That he doesnt regret losing me and will never. That he had sex with me under coercion . It was forceful. And during this while, i came to know H and N have downloaded Viber and are talking there secretly as none of our friends are on that app and they're also video chatting each other all the time. 

I had a fight with N and told her that it seems like she's taken over my life. H and my other friends as well who won't even talk to me anymore or involve me in anything that's happening. All of us are under quarantine and they play online games and video chats and I'm not a part of any of it at all. I've been completely left out in the cold. N went and told H this and he called me yesterday. And he said some really really horrible stuff. That I'm the biggest suffocation of his life, that he hates it when I'm around him or when i call him, that he wants me to stay away from his life, that I'm a dead weight and that I'm the reason people are talking about him and N having an affair. That I'm maligning his name and hers and that I should just keep my mouth shut. The fact that he thinks that I can ever say anything wrong about him just near destroyed me. Everyone's been talking about the both of them because it's very clear what is happening. I just shared what i was going through with a few friends and he got to know it. So now he's putting everything on me and saying that I'm the reason people are thinking all of this nonsense. I kept on explaining and justifying bit he didn't listen. He just kept on saying really really cruel things about me as a person and how he just wants me to fuck off from his life and about how I'm mentally sick. I've gotten several anxiety attacks since then. I literally can't breathe. All i keep thinking about is the cruel stuff he said and crying about it.

I'm losing my mind. I think I will either get committed to an institution or do something to myself. I don't know how things got so bad, how he hates me so much. When at one time i was all the peace he looked for. I wake up and my heart rate is off the roofs. I break down in public places. I cant meet my friends because H is always there with N and they're even more cosy now. And when i see them, i break down even more. I don't know what to do. I'm so fucking lost. I have no hope of things ever getting better with him and I've never imagined my life without him. I don't know how to go about living anymore.

And I know, I KNOW, all of this sounds extremely pathetic. But it's just really fucked with my mental health. I should move on. But i have no idea why i want to salvage it. And like I said, I'm sorry about ranting about inconsequential problems during such a time but it's been weeks and all my friends have completely abandoned me and no one will talk to me at all. I have no one to share things with, so I'm putting it out on the internet to virtual strangers. Maybe it will help, maybe it won't. I just couldn't keep it inside anymore.",1585764469.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,22,31
450,"A friend in a WhatsApp group chat dug himself into a hole while defending police brutality in IndiaThought I would share this amusing instance from yesterday. I usually try to stay away from these conflicts as I've lost a friend in the past due to political differences. But this was too much, so had to speak up.

Someone shared a clip of a policeman mistakenly beating someone else just because he was wearing the same shirt as the guy the cop was chasing. This friend stated that he deserves the beating as he was outside as well.

I tried to talk some sense into him, stating that he could be out to buy essentials, and we shouldn't judge without evidence, but the friend was adamant. A long debate followed, where he blatantly refused to acknowledge all of my points that included a lady doctor being slapped by police in Delhi, a cop hitting a doctor in Tamilnadu and then telling him why didn't he inform him that he was a doctor before he was beaten, and a constable named Rajvir (now suspended) destroying vegetable thelas in Delhi. 

He had two simple answers to my points:

1. Police are standing in 40¬∞ outside for us, so we need to support them NO MATTER WHAT.

2. Why didn't I raise my voice on (insert an issue that fits his narrative)

I told him clearly that I support cops as long as they are properly punishing curfew breakers without exercising brutality and sadism on doctors, people going out to buy essentials, zomato delivery boys, poor vendors etc.

An hour after the debate was over, he posted a clip with tons of laughing smileys. The clip showed police stopping a couple and revealing that the pillion rider was a boy who was under burkha (the rider told the police that ""she"" is his cousin, before the reveal. They were hit with the stick lightly before the video ended.

I watched the clip and found out that it was from Pakistan, as could be seen on the licence the boy showed to the cop. I told my friend that this is definitely an offense and the PAKISTANI policemen are doing an incredible job by punishing them. Then I thanked him for sharing the clip so that police from our nation could learn a thing or two from it.

He didn't respond after that. This guy absolutely HATES Pakistan and his FB is filled with anti-Pak and anti-Muslim posts. I wish I could see his face when he realized that he shared a video from Pakistan. His intention was to clearly show us how Indian police are doing a good job on many cases (and they do, I believe not all of them are brutal sadists), but didn't notice that he was unintentionally praising the police of a nation he hates from the bottom of his heart.",1585751662.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,19,142

495,"What's with the weird authentication mechanisms indian banks use?So I have a fair number of US bank accounts and the way they work is that when I log into my account online, I enter my ID and password and if it's a new device, they either -

1. Send me a code to my email or phone number (this is given as an option)
2. Tell me to enter the 2FA code from an app like Authy or Google Authenticator.
3. Tell me to enter the answers for one of the security questions I have on my account.

This process is similar even when I download the app on a new device and try to login.

Now coming to my NRI account (Axis) and my father's indian bank account (some rando account), this is what I've seen -

1. Try to log in using the website. Enter my ID and password and then it tells me to download an app (I guess this will be used for generating the tokens).
2. I download the app and enter the token being showed here on the website. Now I get another code to my email that I need to enter in this 2FA app. I do that and now it sends a message with some code automatically from my phone. Now since this is a US number, the message fails to deliver and I'm stuck with the process. I have my father's indian phone number on the account and he's not picking up, so I'm stuck until the can do this process for me.

Two gripes I have with this seemingly retarded implementation.

1. Why not just implement the TOTP based 2FA and let us use apps like Authy and Google Authenticator.
2. When you are already verifying me by sending a code to my email, why do you need me to send a message using the number registered on my bank account? What do I do if I want to install this on a device that doesn't have cellular support (like a tablet)?

I don't know if I'm missing something, but can someone explain the reasoning behind this and the fascination with text based OTP in general? Thanks!

However, this is being blown out of proportion. The current administration was looking for a scapegoat and they found it. We've all seen photos of 10s of thousands of migrants crammed in delhi bus stand. We've seen large public gatherings hosted by BJP themselves (MP govt topple victory party, gaumutra party, ayodhya CM event and many others). On top of that, the failure of central government to plan for anything is shocking. They now have the perfect opportunity to blame Muslims as the originator and spreader an of COVID-19. Godi Media is firing on full cylinders. Be careful about what you see and blame all culprits, not one.

590,"Amit Shah is responsible for the Nizamuddin blunder. Infection rates are going to explode.He is the home minister, he allowed this to happen. When the police was just next door to this muslim venue. Amit Shah is using the corona virus to create another hindu muslim war. You can see all BJP and RSS members blaming muslims and not the event. All efforts by the government is to blame the virus spread on muslims. Amit Shah is willing to let hindus die of this virus just to paint muslims as the bad people here. 

This entire thing would not have been possible if the police did their job, which is controlled by Amit Shah and they allowed this religious gathering to happen. And now Amit Shah is trying to blame muslims, it looks like it was planned out, the home minister would obviously have been informed about this gathering of hundreds of foreign muslims in the capital city, if the virus was spreading Amit Shah should have stopped this from happening on February but he did not. He wanted a full muslim group to be present in Delhi . The government is putting indians in danger and playing with the lives of the entire nation by playing this dangerous games. Amit Shah and his vendata to kill muslims will drag india down. This incident will explode the infection rates but in the end Amit sha and his BJP/RSS bigots will then target muslims and attack them. 

Tl:DR Amit Shah is using the Corona virus to build an anti muslim narrative allowing the virus to spread and putting innocent hindus in danger.

Isn't Amit shah a Persia by origin, this explains his hate for muslims.",1585715061.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,10,0

656,"Coronavirus lockdown: Tipplers in Kerala with withdrawal symptoms to get special passes to buy liquorSpecial passes will be issued for tipplers in Kerala to buy liquor but on doctor's prescription that they are showing withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of alcohol in view of lockdown over novel coronavirus spread.

A decision allowing the purchase of liquor from the Excise department in a ""controlled manner"" was taken by the state government to ""resolve"" what it called many social issues including suicidal tendencies and frustration among people who consumed alcohol regularly.

However, the medical fraternity was up in arms on Tuesday against the government order.

The Kerala Government Medical Officer's Association (KGMOA) has decided to observe April 1 as 'black day' in protest against the order issued late on Monday night.

Dr Vijayakrishnan G S, General Secretary of the KGMOA, called the decision a medical blunder.

The Indian Medical Association(IMA) also flayed the Left government's plan to supply liquor to addicts based on prescription, saying it was not ""scientific"".

Three men in Kerala have committed suicide after allegedly showing alcohol withdrawal symptoms within days after liquor stores shut the doors following the 21-day national lockdown that came into force last Wednesday to try halt the spread of COVID-19. Similar incidents have been reported in other parts of the country including in neighbouring Telangana and Karnataka.

Kerala has the highest per capita consumption of alcohol in the country. The sale of liquor in the state has continued on an upward spiral despite the prohibitive tax on legal alcohol and the many dry days.

The state had a record Rs 14,508 crore liquor sales in 2018-19 sold through the Kerala State Beverages Corporation (Bevco), the state-owned liquor retail monopoly, compared to around Rs 11,000 crore in the previous year, according to official data.

Victoria (2015)- Raw, gripping and some certain innocence in this movie. While the entire movie is shot in one take, it feel like you're actually there, watching everything unfold. 

Columbus (2017)- Relevant drama, real people, real situations, and real issues everyone can be forced to deal with. 

Moor (2015)- A heart wrenching story about corruption, family and one's desire for a better life. And the cinematography is just wow.

Bioscopewala (2017)- Based on one of our most favorite childhood story ""Kaabuliwala"" by Rabindranath Tagore, but the twist is just wow. The direction, cinematography is brilliant and so is the acting. 

Triangle (2009)- Have you ever watched a movie so thrilling and so filled with mystery that you spend next few days thinking about what could have been happened if it happened some other way? No. Then watch it. 

Sin Nombre (2009)- One of the most powerful, enlightening, depressing and yet, strangely uplifting films I've seen this year. This also shows the grit and the beauty of Mexico. Realistic and melodramatic.",1585682806.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,4,12

It was the one thing that had me occupied when I got diagnosed with depression couple months back. However, lately, it's creeping into my work life making me less functional and more anxious and immobile while working. Feeling like a failure, which spirals in worse thoughts.

So I've been thinking to take a break, but I am afraid I'll be kicked out of the job. I am unsure of how my bosses will recieve a leave application on the grounds of mental illness. Are they in their rights, legally, to kick me out? Or am I protected under some law? I don't plan to take a break for more than 5 days. 

If they are in their rights to kick me out, I'll stick to working. Would be really helpful to have some advice on how to cope while working.

691,"The plight of daily wagers shows how wrong Indian society is. Instead of giving people fair wages, we are now donating to ""feed the wager"" campaigns as if they are some animals needing help.No where in the civilized world can you get a human to do stuff for you, 12 hours a day, for less than Rs. 300.   
The people working as masons, painters, fabrication welders etc. are all paid less than the minimum wage in most cities, despite being quite skilled at their work. Same goes for maids and cooks in most parts of the country. Someone I know hires a full time maid for 20k in Mumbai, with food and lodging included. But many don't get that much, especially in smaller cities and villages. Security guards even in places like Gurgaon and Delhi earn less than 10k a month.   
Growing up, it was common to see and expect a slum in the vicinity of a new apartment complex because that is where the ""bais"" and their ""car-washing"" husbands stay. That has not changed at all, it has worsened now and slums are home to many more professions (including TEACHERS of all people). 

We often hear people say ""life in India is really good because you have a maid, a cook and a driver for daily life"". This is because these folks never got what they deserved. They are exploited and without contracts. 

I find it incredibly insensitive to see campaigns like ""feed a daily wager"" as if they are zoo animals. No one gives a shit about their well being and fair pay when they should. The ""good life"" in India is because the middle class and the rich just want the wagers to survive like animals. Nowhere in the world would this same middle class with their level of income, even if they earn in USD, get so many human services for such cheap rates. 

I believe this is happening to white collar jobs as well. For all the ""no-skills-in-graduates"" bullshit, many graduates even from good colleges almost work for free and have to depend on their parents. 

TLDR: Indians brag about having maids and cooks and cleaners as a quality of life enhancer. Truth is that they can afford them ONLY because they are being exploited. The current campaigns to ""feed the wager"" could have been more sensitive to their plight and focused on creating a formal, contracted workforce of helpers, and unorganized sector employees.",1585707261.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,122,312

704,"Questions from an American who's been to India (long)For anyone who will tolerate it, I have a bunch of questions about how India is weathering this situation, and how it differs from what we're going through in the US.  Any answers are appreciated!

1)  How are people getting food?  There have been news reports of the police being allowed to use violence on people leaving their homes, and on food delivery drivers, so how is anyone eating?

2)  Are there still shanty towns for the poor?  How are they coping with this?  From what I recall, those areas don't have pantries and fridges that they could stock up in a time of quarantine.

3)  In your opinions, does the average Indian believe this is a real thing, believe it's exaggerated, believe this is a government conspiracy, believe this is end times?  How does the average Indian redditor differ?  I don't follow this page often, so I have no idea.

4)  Has there been a reasonable transition to working from home for those in amenable industries?  Who is considered an ""essential worker"" there?

5)  Are people who require treatment receiving it, to the best of your knowledge?  There were also reports of hospitals turning away presumptive COVID patients, and I have no ability to discern what's being blown out of proportion and what's true.

6)  Do you feel like this is helping to unify the country, or is it exacerbating tensions with various groups?  

7)  Are people wearing masks when they're out?  Are they allowed to go out?

8)  Is the pollution diffusing with the quarantines?  

9)  Is tech so widespread now that you feel that the remote villages have an idea of what's going on?  

From my end, I'm in Ohio, USA.  Our state shutdown earlier than most, as in the schools were closed, work-from-home orders were placed, and bars and restaurants and religious gatherings were shuttered.  We have many cases in our hospitals, and many outside, but our system hasn't been overwhelmed (yet?) due to early action.  Stay safe all!",1585695278.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,35

Hope you're doing well.

I realize there are a few out there, such as Perfios, but I found none of them quite upto the mark.

I'm thinking of creating a mix of Mint and YNAB (not sure if you've heard of it) myself, and thinking if anyone else would like to use it. I've observed Indians are usually reluctant in trusting a third party with their financial data, don't know how much truth that belief carries.

What do you guys think? If I do create something really secure (I guarantee this), would you trust me with your data? How much would you pay for the service?

After graduating last year I did some social work in eastern Europe for a couple of months, came back to India, it took a while but I found a job. Bosses were kinda toxic I left that company in a month, trust me, I couldn't have stayed. They ended up not paying me, I sent a legal notice threatening legal action, no dice. I thought forgiveness will liberate me and not exonerate the perpetrator, so i moved on

. Found this fantastic job a couple of months later, brilliant pay for a starter, and now here I am, me and 2 more new employees laid off. I don't know what to feel about this, I don't know if I'm inherently a good person but I really try to be better everyday, have no bad intentions for anyone,  even those who wronged me. I know I'm still privileged af compared to what others are going through, and my heart bleeds for them. I wish god helps them before me coz they need it more. But that doesn't change the fact that I feel like complete shit and worthless right now, thoughts like if I didn't take that trip I'd be employed somewhere for a year now, but that trip was genuinely the best weeks of my life.

At Morning during Breakfast he says these Muslims will kill us all, they should be thrown out of this country in response to the Nizzammudin coronavirus case in front of my 10 yo sister and me, first time I heard it so directly this hate against the Muslim by my father and then he began saying all sorts of things, their religion teaches terrorism, they consider their God to be the only true God and it orders them to kill the Kafirs, I said that it's not the case many Muslims aren't like that and some specific Muslims believe that and many Muslims are good and most of the Muslims are the ones killed by terrorism in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria etc.


   When I was seeing NDTV at 2:00 pm he said everyone knows if coronavirus cases rise in India then India is gone, Ravish Kumar isn't saying anything new and he is spreading negativity and he is supported by the JNU intellectuals and gets money from outside India for spreading this negativity and all, these people all are all anti- India, you should watch Zee news that guy there is the best and shows real news. I told him he was in denial and loves Zee news because it shows what you like and not the facts, I didn't argue with him and so I didn't said anything else.


Now my father is a hypocrite, smokes cigarette 5-7 times a day but says how can you play games and thinks he is correct all the time but gets super angry at very small things talks about negativity lol, typical middle class you know some family stuff which is why I didn't wanted to argue with him, I just want to finally move out from my house, but this quarantine sucks for me.",1585650292.0,#ddbd37,Politics,dark,39,77

üëâ **Why is there such a difference between the Government's numbers and that of sites like covid19india.org?**

The [government](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) only updates the numbers twice a day (look for the timestamp) and is often behind covid19india.org which updates throughout the day based on state bulletins. The government's dashboard only lists the *active* count. Add that to the deaths, discharged, and migrated figures to get the total (or confirmed) figure which should tally with the figures from other sites such as covid19india.org.

950,"My rant about masksYou know even surgical masks need meltblown filter. It is the main element which is in scarcity.

Also enough with the ' masks not mandatory ' bullshit. This is just a hoax perpetuated by governments to hide the shortage. A month ago they were saying that you don't need masks. Now they are saying to use cloth wrap or surgical masks as they are now being mass produced and we have not that much shortage. These so called experts on tv are just paid shills. 

Just use a simple reasoning. If only the infected need to wear the mask then why is every govt. official wearing it. Are the all infected? No. They wear it because they interact with random people who MAY BE INFECTED. Same is the reason why I wear mask when leaving house. I'll be meeting random people like, shopkeepers, pedestrians, guards, employees, rickshaw/auto walas etc who MAY BE  INFECTED.

Also the reasoning that people wear it wrong is pretty stupid. I knew a person who applied sanitizer and then rinsed his hands with water. Does that makes the sanitizer useless/inefficient. Did I told him to not use sanitizer because it doesn't work. 

Nope, i just told him the proper way to use it. People don't know hoe to use PPE properly because NOBODY FUCKING TOLD THEM HOW TO USE IT.

A simple 30 sec ad thrice a day can solve this stupid issue.


The SARS-COV-2 is 0.1 micron in size. N95 Masks are rated for 0.3 microns. If someone infected sneezes near you and you inhale the same time you have a 20% chance to contracting it even with the  n95 masks because the smallest airborne particles which resides in air for some 40-50 seconds can pass through it.
Surgical mask will only trap finer mist droplets.
Cloth will only stop large droplets. Cough or sneeze on a paper and you'll see droplets. Cloth will only stop that. Everything finer will get through.

P100 is the shit we need. It's rated for 0.1 micron. Sadly we can't make it right now in bulk. So that's only reserved for elites.

https://www.google.com/search?q=p100+mask+particle+size&client=ms-android-asus-tpin&prmd=sivn&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi2s-T_kMToAhVYb30KHXjFAaoQ_AUoAnoECA0QAg&biw=424&bih=720#imgrc=kx2V6PaEfxuOaM


Another thing to add here. Manufacturers have government at their priority.They won't release a single mask if the government tells them not to. Only the excess ppe gets released to the market. So yeah if you are lucky to get a quality face mask, buy it. Virtue signalling won't save your life. You can survive this pandemic with a 10-pack. Even if this shit lasts 5 months, supply runs twice a month will take two masks, meaning you can live for 5 months with minimal risk to yourself, even if you dispose it every time you use it. 10 masks won't even last two days for a doctor. I think you'll be helping the doctors more by not getting yourself and your family infected by taking every possible precaution you can rather than donating them a chump change of masks and leaving yourself vulnerable and getting infected and then sucking up other important resources like ventilators, icu, their time etc

Don't worry about doctors and healthcare professionals. They have government by the balls. There have been multiple threats to government that they'll resign if not supplied with proper ppe. They have leverage over govt. They CAN demand things.

You can't.

BJP will put forward a strong ""personality""/""face"" - this cannot be beat by an amorphous coalition - they too will need people to lead from the front, not decide leaders after post-election squabbling. 

But at the national level, the only secular hope is a multi-party coalition. Who is the best PM and deputy-PM (yes, I think this job will need to be reactivated to keep all coalition partners happy) choices from the current secular parties that could come together to form a national govt?

Doing my basic moronmath. Please feel free to correct.

Looking at Italy with about 1 lakh people roughly counted as  infected and death of 11000 with a total population of 6 crores. If India gets a infected population of 20 lakhs and and 10% die that's **TOTAL  2 lakh  estimated deaths for India .**

&#x200B;

So with a regular death rate of 6-7 lakhs per month in India can majority of corona deaths be just be brushed under the carpet??

&#x200B;

There is no testing being done, will we just live in a false sense of security looking at low numbers. At the end of the lockdown will people start imagining that the lockdown worked?

&#x200B;

**Edit: Sorry people, I dont mean to sound HEARTLESS**. I was just wondering if the government can build a false narrative and mislead people. I am also fucking stressed.

**Question**\- ""Does eating yoghurt and sitting under sun help reduce the effects of Corona Virus""   
**Answer by Dr Prabhat Agarwal of SN Medical College, Agra** \- Yes, by sitting under sun increases Vitamin D, and eating yoghurt, improves immunity, and doing these things will **reduce effects of Corona Virus**""

  
Imagine if anybody reads this, he will think, oh a doctor is saying this, so maybe social distancing is not so important, eating well is more important.

1122,"A long read but definitely provides much food for thought! Would like to know your thoughts on this.A comprehensive summary and analysis by Jaideep Varma. 

""If you're one of those who cannot bear an alternative opinion, please don't burden your dainty mind further. But if you're fine with wading into a fresh perspective that has no pretensions of being the last word, some of you might just find this constructed case below worth your time. 

It seeks to examine if there has been an international overreaction to Coronavirus, entirely in synch with the polarised world this virus was born into. 

Let's proceed fact-by-fact. (All stats from the public domain; have aggregated to actually provide a conservative estimate. References in first comment). I've tried to simplify this as much as I can, for easy comprehension. 

1) 
The following are the fatality rates of Coronavirus in different age-groups: 

0-9 yrs - 0%; 10-19 yrs - 0.2%; 20-29 yrs - 0.2%; 
30-39 yrs - 0.2%; 40-49 yrs - 0.4%; 50-59 yrs - 1.4%; 
60-70 yrs - 3.8%; 70-79 yrs - 8%; 80+ yrs - 15%. 

So, even an infected person of over 80 years has an 85% chance of survival. It is important to understand that Coronavirus affects mostly people with pre-existing conditions, which is why the fatality rate really starts notably increasing from the age-group 50-59. 

(Also, the rumours about more men dying are true; the proportion is roughly 70:30. Given that this is a respiratory disease, this discrepancy has been linked to smoking by some experts, not to any specific targeting by the virus).

2) 
The following is the approximate outcome for infected people: 

95% infected people need 2 weeks to recover with no medicine, from home. 
5% need hospitalisation.
2% need ICU.
1% need ventilator.

So, the vast majority of infected people can just recover by staying at home, with no medicine. Even seemingly well-educated people don't seem to grasp this properly. Please hold on to this fact. 

The big concern for authorities is for a large number of cases to be in that 5% when there are fewer hospital beds available, and especially in that 1% where there is a considerable shortage of ventilators.  

3) 
In warmer countries, for some reason that is still not clear, the fatality rate is considerably lower than other places so far, and the overall fatality rate of about 4.5%. 

Brazil: 2.7%; Malaysia: 1.2%; Thailand: 0.4%; Saudi Arabia: 0.3%; India: 2.3%. (The two outliers are Indonesia and Philippines with 8.4% and 6.7% but experts have stated these figures have emerged due to very low testing in that part of the world; more testing would lower the fatality rates considerably). 

Low testing is a big problem in India as well. However, there are no reports of people with symptoms crowding hospitals as there are in many other countries. And it is important to understand that if there are indeed many latent cases as is feared, that would actually bring DOWN the fatality rate. 

Death tallies can't be faked and it is hard to hide the dead - that is the key number, and that is 20 over ten-odd days. Even with limited testing, the average number of new Indian cases is in the region of 100-120 a day; it has been like that for a week. Which means there is absolutely no evidence of exponential community spread till date in India. And that has so far been the case in all of the warm weather countries. 

4) 
In human history, untreated illnesses and unvaccinated viruses have the following as fatality rates: 

Rabies - 99%; AIDS 80-90%; EBOLA 87%; Smallpox - 65%; Bubonic/Pneumonic Plague 52%; Tetanus 50%; Cholera 47%; TB 43%; Chickenpox 30%; Typhoid 15%; SARS 11%; Spanish Flu 10%; Zika Virus 8%; Yellow Fever 7.5%; Diphtheria 7.5%; Coronavirus 4.5%; Measles 2.5%; Swine Flu 2.1%. 

So, Coronavirus has among the lowest fatality rates in history.

This is the first virus to travel so far (199 countries) in this new world, polarised more than ever before in human history by social media and mobile technology. A global virus in an intensely globalised world should not be a surprise at all, spreading during peak travel season, both, domestically in China and internationally. The virus itself is more contagious than most other viruses that came before, but not by such a great margin. 

There have been many pandemics in human history, many of them far, far worse than this one (in terms of fatalities). But the reaction worldwide has been fraught with anxiety and panic in the face of the uncertainty of having no cure yet. 

Incidentally, uncertainty is a condition that people in this new world (mobile social media) deal with far worse than any previous generation in history - this has been well documented and discussed in recent times. Has that had a greater say this time than the pandemic itself? 

5) 
WHO estimates deaths arising from common flu to be between 290,000 to 650,000 people every year, at a fatality rate of roughly 1%. Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 so far in about four months, with very limited testing in many parts of the world (truer testing would lower its 4.5% fatality rate considerably). 

Also, two recent studies done in Italy comprehensively show that ""less than 1% of the deceased were healthy persons, or persons without pre-existing chronic diseases."" Which means, in the face of so much focus on Coronavirus, it is not clear in many places ""who died FROM the Coronavirus and who died WITH the Coronavirus"". 

Incidentally, between the five winter seasons in Italy between 2013 and 2017, there were 68,000 deaths from common flu. That means an average of about 4,500 deaths a month during the winter season (where February is the peak month). This has very emphatically been a trend in the last decade in Italy anyway - of elderly people dying in droves from flu during the winter months. Does Italy's death toll of approximately 9,000 in three months due to Coronavirus seem high in light of this? Especially when the Italians themselves are not sure in many cases if the patients are dying of Coronavirus or merely with it. 

The US, who have just overtaken Italy on number of Coronavirus cases, have an even more sordid record when it comes to the common flu. In the 2017/28 flu season, the US registered 61,000 deaths from flu. That's an average of over 10,000 deaths a month! In the 2018/19 flu season, there were 34,200 deaths - that's 5,700 deaths a month. So far, there have been about 1500 deaths from Coronavirus in the US. 

It is worth repeating this - the Coronavirus has killed about 27,000 in four months, while an average of WHO's tally of common flu deaths every year is about 39,000 deaths PER MONTH and critically, within EXACTLY the same patient base. And recent studies in Italy have found that it is not entirely clear if many of the patients actually died from the Coronavirus. 

This is a huge point that will no doubt be explored in great depth by the medical fraternity in months to come. But it is worth thinking about this - what would happen if there was intense 24-hour media scrutiny worldwide on the common flu deaths - at the rate of about 39,000 a month worldwide ? What would it do to our minds? If we discount the absence of uncertainty (as common flu has prescribed cures, which is why the fatality rate is low) would it not lead to a similar brand of panic that we see now? (This disproportionate panic is apparent in the smallest things; like, despite WHO and the American Surgeon General categorically saying that masks are useless unless a person has definite symptoms, there has been a frenzy for them.) 

Obviously, this is not at all a case to downplay the Coronavirus pandemic. It has to be combatted, and the key ways are well-known by now - social distancing, regular hand-washing, quarantines, and closing down travel. A lockdown in places where there are signs of community spreading is definitely desirable. Even as a precaution, this is a good option, for a limited period.   

Beyond dispensations and politics, this is about worldwide frenzy and alarmism, accentuated by a mainstream media that comprehensively leans towards worst-case scenarios in the name of erring on the side of safety. And many people are unable to adjust their mind to the fact that those are worst-case scenarios and that ""experts"" in most fields do not even agree with each other, and so get stuck on pessimistic, and often outlandish views as the most credible one (which in turn gets perpetuated). It is a perfect pointer to our times how so many react violently to that singular view being questioned, and alternative views derisively dismissed without its facts examined at all. (This does make one wonder about climate-change alarmism as well. For example, it is worth remembering that before William Nordhaus won the Economics Nobel in 2018, climate change anti-alarmists were equated with climate deniers.) 

But here's the kicker. Why is it that the far higher death tallies of flu in recent years, in exactly the same patient group as that of Coronavirus, never got the kind of attention that the Coronavirus tallies have received? Could it have something to do with the largely modest economic and social classes getting affected by the common flu? And the travelling/ jet-setting classes of people who are affected by the Coronavirus? Couple this class consciousness (and the blatant sacrificing of the worker class in some countries, like India) with the fear mongering that the political class relies on to subjugate the masses, at a time when leadership standards all around the world are at an all-time low than ever before in human history, and we have a lethal combination. 

Yes, Coronavirus has changed the world but is it because of the pandemic itself or because of how all of us have responded to it?""",1585649944.0,,Coronavirus,dark,6,1

1124,"Is this crisis finally exposing the relation between caste and inequality?This is the most sustained critique I have seen so far grounded in a critique of caste and inequality:

""...Dalit man had to be content that his Brahmin overlord allowed him certain social ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù ‚Äì he could walk up to his porch ‚Äì that his community was deemed unworthy of. It was compensation enough, gratitude enough.

""It is a similar sentiment, rooted in upper caste, upper class Hindu privilege, that animated the clapping and clanging of utensils with which Narendra Modi‚Äôs ‚Äújanta curfew‚Äù climaxed on Sunday.""

""... the Brahmanical conception of ‚Äúservice‚Äù. That ‚Äúlife must be devoted to selfless service, without desire for its fruits‚Äù, as Ramesh Gampat puts it in Sanatana Dharma and Plantation Hinduism, and, crucially, ‚Äúwithout agency‚Äù.

""Deploying the same language of service and sacrifice \[...\], he only had vague promises to offer the poor and marginalised who will bear the brunt of the lockdown. 

The central government is working with states and civil society groups to lessen the suffering of the poor,‚Äù Modi said, as if he were doing charity.""

""A civilised and actually meaningful way of showing gratitude to essential services personnel ‚Äì and the working class generally ‚Äì would be to provide them living wages, safe working conditions, strong labour protections, and dignity. Not a cacophony.

1262,"How badly will mobile phone industry in India be affected by GST from 12 to 18 percent during recession.Government raised the taxes of phones in India from 12% to 18% and now because of coronavirus, it's inevitable that a non essential sector such as mobile phones will have significantly lesser demand.

Add the fact that people will have a lot less purchasing power because of business losses, lost jobs, etc.

I'm no economist but higher taxes during recession seems like a recipe for killing the industry.

Rupee fell down to 75 per dollar which means every 10000 rupee sale fetches companies about $10 lesser than it used to.

Imported phones will now be priced at 28% duties(same as before), 18% GST (up from 12) and Rs. 75/dollar (up from 70/dollar).

This means iPhone 11 pro which costs thousand dollars changes from :

Old : 70k + 30k tax = 1 lakh

New : 75k + 34.5k tax = 1.1 lakh

This is an extra 10% net burden on the consumer during a recession. That's significant enough to matter.

Worst case for India could be 1 out of 3 people get infected, our health system collapses, most of the doctors are infected, most of the MPs are infected and 2/3 population just dies and turned in to a fossil fuel. Later On, china sneaks in from all sides and occupy the country and become a giant super power in south. This will take about an year to happen or may one and half year.

Best case scenario, we get to a maximum total 4000-5000 cases, contained within the reach of health care system capacity.

1356,"Do you feel coronavirus saga will define a generation?All the questions and topics here have been practical and related to politics. So I have a query which is rather philosophical in its approach:

This virus has had a traumatic effect on us as a species the likes of which I doubt have ever been seen. Bigger than even WW2 in my opinion. It is ironic since just two months ago I got obsessed with world war 2 and read and researched everything I Could find. The great war changed human psyche in most parts of the world. There are some amazing books--especially ones that tacked the battle of Berlin(random suggestion- lib. gen. rus Cornelius Ryan and Anthony Beevor's books on the final battle which ended with Hitlers death). When the battle finally arrived many berliners were stunned to do anything. Walking around corpses who they talked to a day before, everything was a daze and just breathing was a priveledge that made them smile. It changed the psyche on an individual and collective level. 

This Convid came out of nowhere and left us stunned. The world is locked in and there is palpable fear. What makes it shocking is how just 2 weeks ago evryrthing was so routine. Last month this time I was chilling with my joint pondering which game to play on my PS4. And now it looks like the apocalypse. My house looks different the same locations look surreal. It's like I am in a daze. 

what do you guys think the future is gonna be like? 
Just imagine the day lockdown ends. Taking the bus and trains again. Going to the saloon. Talking to colleagues at work. I can sense it will be surreal on a collective level for all of us. This is collective trauma that the berliners felt when the war reached home but magnified several times for the enemy is the same for all of us. 

What will be the future once (hoping) things resume? Will there be a renewed kindling of all people or we will revert back to the same baloney we were used to?

Surely globalization as a concept will take a hit. The economic recurpussions will be immense. But on an individual level will things be the same as they were pre corona? The frailty of our existence is looking at us squarely in the face.",1585578620.0,,,dark,8,19

When there are some stuck without homes and nowhere to go. I love the way some elites are positing their fitness videos on the social media. When there are 1000s of migrants walking 100s of miles and this is not for exercise. I love the way people are posting their favorite recipe pictures on Instagram. When there are people sitting in the middle of the roads eating whatever is handed out to them out of kindness. I love the way people screamed and shouted at the airports when they were quarantined for a few hours.Wonder how many of them were herded together and sprayed with chemicals. There are two different Indias that we live in. One for the rich and one for the poor. Sometimes, we are unable to see beyond our life, our world, our zones of comfort. I know we don't do it deliberately, it's just that we don't realize what we are doing because we haven't seen the India of the poor. We have been shielded away from it. Forget about understanding, we can't even empathize with that India. The India of the poor. Hopefully, some day we will be able to look beyond these boundaries and recognize the other side of India, which is starving and fighting for their lives, even as we show discomfort of being locked down for a few days.

1386,"Time For Our Religious Leaders To Give BackIn these challenging times, so many celebs and enterprises and humanitarian orgs have come forward to donate their wealth or their time. Everyday working class people are donating to the PM relief fund and yet the institutes that took funds from everyone as ""chadawa"" are missing. 

Let's use this time to at least spread awareness among our families about the true pillars of our society. We don't need fancy temples asking people to donate their lives savings, operating under the guise of NGOs, and then shutting their doors when humanity needs them; if we give, it should be for the betterment of the weak and feeble, not to people who offer spiritual guidance to only who can afford it. Not to those who prey on the weakest and often shame them into giving more than they can afford to. Let's mount pressure on all these institutes to give back their years of accumulated wealth by keeping track of those who do and those also who hide behind ""trusts"" to say their hands are tied. 

I am not eloquent and also not aware of the names of most of these institutes, but those of you who are, can you help with compiling lists (irrespective of religion) and circulating this info in Hindi and other regional languages? Let's build towards a more progressive India, one that still leans on its scriptures strengths but does not submit to ignorant drainage of the economic resources. That asks for delivery on promises made.

I have no political or religious motivations to post this. While I identity as a spiritual agnostic, my family does not.

1416,"Sandesh, roshogolla: Bengal sweet shops to open from Tuesday amid coronavirus lockdownA  dessert or a sweet dish is a must after a Bengali meal. Keeping in mind the sweet-tooth of the people of state, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has decided to relax the lockdown rules for the sweets industry.

From Today onwards, sweet shops will remain open between 12 pm to 4 pm to cater to the cravings for something sweet --- maybe a cottage cheese sandesh or syrupy roshogolla -- after a hearty meal.

But why was the chief minister keen on opening the sweet shops?

Apart from her understanding of the Bengali taste buds and the fetish for sweets, Mamata Banerjee is trying to help milkmen and people involved in dairy businesses.

Mamata Banerjee received information that cottage cheese (chhena/paneer) was going to waste after the lockdown and that milkmen were throwing away milk in drains.

With sweet shops being affected by the lockdown, the cottage cheese and milk industry are suffering losses. Hence, Mamata Banerjee's move could be an initiative to help these people carry on their trade.

However, according to political pundits, this initiative will go a long way politically too as it showcases her love for the people of her state and everything that matters to them.

Computers have always been my passion since I was very young and I have a big interest in the field of cybersecurity which is why I plan on doing masters. My bachelors curriculum is not upto date with today‚Äôs standards but I understand that they have to teach us the basics of everything so we can get a grasp on the bigger stuff 

I plan on doing my masters in Germany because it fits under my budget and I‚Äôve talked to my parents and relatives about this and they have agreed but all I‚Äôve heard so far from them is why do you want to do masters, it doesn‚Äôt hold value 

Experience is the only thing that matters ( I don‚Äôt know how true is this because I‚Äôm still studying ) is what they keep telling me. They tell me that within 5 years of experience in my field I can earn more than what I can with my masters degree 

My family is very money oriented which I believe is a good thing in a way, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm the same. I do know that money is very important and if I‚Äôm well paid then it‚Äôs more than enough for me, I don‚Äôt want to show off my riches to anyone 

I guess I‚Äôm looking for people with somewhat similar experience or who are working professionals in computer science to give me advice on what to do 

I don‚Äôt know why but my family telling me that masters is not really of any use is holding me back from doing pursuing it 

Any advice is appreciated ! Thanks",1585585830.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,6,4

> If PAN and Aadhaar are not linked before March 31, then your PAN will become inoperative. Earlier the rules did not clearly define the term 'inoperative'. However, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) in a notification dated February 13, 2020 clarified the meaning of PAN becoming 'inoperative' and how to make it operative once again.
> 
> According to CBDT, if PAN becomes inoperative with effect from April 1, 2020, you will not be able to use your PAN to conduct financial transactions wherever quoting of PAN is mandatory. Some of these financial transactions include opening of a bank account, investing in a fixed deposit, filing of income tax returns etc.
> 
> Further, once the PAN becomes inoperative, it will be deemed that a person does not have a PAN. However, in case PAN becomes inoperative, then it will not affect the financial transactions undertaken by an individual retrospectively. This is because Budget 2019 presented in July, amended the law on the same. Prior to the new law, if PAN is not linked with Aadhaar, then it would be deemed as PAN would become invalid and this would have impacted the financial transactions undertaken by an individual retrospectively. To protect the validity of such transactions, the law was amended.

IMHO, the administration was aware of this trust deficient and knew that a lockdown in phases would lead to people trampling each other to -  stock supplies/commute to their hometowns. Therefore, the only possible version of the lockdown that resembles a lockdown is a lockdown we are witnessing.

A lot can be said about a system when it experiences stress. But, one the thing that will torment the souls of millions is Labour Laws and the absence of a safety net for vulnerable citizens. I hope, our people never experience the clusterf\*\*k of a healthcare system we have in place.

1562,"Full text of Rahul Gandhi's letter to PM Modi calling for a ""nuanced approach"" to the lockdown>Hon‚Äôble Shri Narendra Modi 
>Prime Minister of India 

>Dear Prime Minister, I would like to convey to you my solidarity along with that of millions of Congress party workers at this time of immense humanitarian crisis. We are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps the government is taking to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in India. 

>The world has been forced to take immediate, severe measures to contain the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus and India is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. I must urge you to seriously consider the potentially devastating impact a nationwide lockdown would have on our people, our society and our economy. 

>It is critical for us to understand that India's conditions are unique. We may be required to take different steps than other large countries who are following a total lockdown strategy. The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the Covid-19 virus. 

>It is important that the government consider a more nuanced and targeted approach that takes the complex realities of our people into consideration. Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young the dangers of their proximity to older people.

> Millions of India‚Äôs elderly live in villages. A complete lockdown and the resulting shut down of our economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents, grandparents and the elderly population. This will result in a catastrophic loss of life. 

>We must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. The financial package announced by the government is a good first step. But speedy delivery of the package is important. Please announce and enforce a clear roadmap with dates for its implementation. Large population centres will require equally large, dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators. It is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the necessary equipment as fast as is humanly possible. At the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out and get an accurate picture of the virus‚Äôs spread in order to contain it. 

>The government‚Äôs sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. Thousands of migrant workers have been forced to leave their rented homes as they are unable to pay rent. It is important that the government intervenes and provide them money for their rent immediately. Factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk to their villages and are stranded at various state borders. They are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. They are struggling to seek refuge as they march to reach far-away homes. It is important that we help them find shelter and inject money directly into their bank accounts to help them survive these arduous next few months. 

>It is also critical that we set up a defensive wall around our key financial and strategic institutions to protect them from the shock wave that is bound to come as the true impact of the virus and our economic shutdown hits us a few weeks from now. Our informal economy and immense network of small and medium businesses and farmers are going to be vital to any rebuilding effort. It is crucial that we engage them in a conversation, build their confidence and protect their interests with correct and timely action. 

>We stand together with the government in fighting and overcoming this tremendous challenge. 

>With best wishes, Rahul Gandhi

Before I go further, I‚Äôd like to re-iterate again that this is just a thought & there maybe several ways to improve upon it.  
  
Firstly every citizen should be liable to pay direct tax. If it‚Äôs a farmer, poor person, any working adult should pay a measly suggested sum of say ‚Çπ10 **per fiscal year** as their share of tax.  

How would this help?  
  
First things first, we are too large a nation not to collect any direct tax from the vast majority of the people. I understand rich people pay more tax but only so much tax can be collected from them. I think the government may have stretched their limits here because increasing any rate on them would eventually funnel more money through their backdoors (black money, foreign tax havens).  
Also, it‚Äôs no hidden fact that the majority of black money is generated from agricultural activities which are not liable to report any income since they are fully exempt. Politicians & Rich businessman funnel a lot of money through this buy showing part of their income from agricultural land.  
It would also help the government to identify beneficiaries of their schemes because there will be somewhat accurate picture of the people who paid tax and are the benefactors of their scheme.",1585545137.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,10,11

It didn't help as they kept on calling me and harrassing me over calls to recharge. I tried everything to make them to stop calling me, sent out mails, tweets, calls everything bit nothing worked. So, I had to block all the numbers they called from. Eventually everything stopped.

- Fast forward to March 2020 -

I got a sudden mail from their legal team that says they are going to file a case if I don't return the router. The problem is that I had shifted my house since then and the router is lost. Anyways In their mail there is a doc which needed to be filled for pickup. I filled that form in order to negotiate with the pickup partner for the router.

- I found private data breach -

In the Google doc that I've filled my information I've found that if you go to edit response you are able to read all the information of all the people who've filled that form. It is just lying there open to all. It contains addresses and phone numbers of around 700 users. I think that this is private data and no company can make it public like this.

So the question is what can be done from my end so that I don't get sued?",1585558043.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,19,28

 Unfortunately, they came  begging on my door today, begging for water. Any guesses, what progressed? 
My uncle shooed them away since it's quarantine and these people are supposed to be getting stuff at their houses.
So in name of quarantine, I believe the  thing my so morally righteous uncle did was to tell someone thirsty to  get off his property since they should have been getting supplies at home. 
When asked from my dear uncle, why would they  even beg for water if  it was available to them, his response was if they would have given their address to him he would have made sure that they got the supplies.

Not sure from other's perspective but from mine it was absolutely horrendous to shoo someone away like that .

1655,"Don't prove social media and messaging platforms to be the next deadly thing during coronavirus crisis!Don't prove social media and messaging platforms to be the next deadly thing during coronavirus crisis. I've witnessed a lot of misinformation about the crisis since the last 72 hours, instead of pointing fingers at each other, let's talk some sense here! 

Rumors and misinformation are causing a lot of unnecessary chaos, misunderstanding and unwanted fear amongst already panicking general public! Our healthcare and emergency services are already getting burnt out and these rumors make them lot harder to work for you! Sharing wrongful information and videos can make it go viral across platforms, manipulate the algorithms and direction of the news. Furthermore, these rumors may start to outperform the real news.

If you really want to share some information or videos about coronavirus, it's a humble request to follow these simple steps:

- It's important to know the facts first, but also understand how those around you get the information. Be patient, kind and fact-based.
- If you are the original source of information, think logically if it's the right thing to do and check for facts if you're not sure! Provide all exhaustive details as possible which includes day, date and time, location, names with valid and genuine reasoning. And for god's sake PLEASE STOP politicizing the posts and cause religious outrage, and I'm looking right at you keyboard warriors, just stop ranting let's put science ahead of that nonsense!
- Before you share something on any platform, ask yourself if it‚Äôs constructive for everyone who might see or hear it. Even if you intend to share something with only your friends and family, they might share it as well, and their followers might share it too, then again, can possibly change the direction of the news! 
- Check the source and the source's source for their authenticity, because regardless of whether the information came from your family member, friend, a public official, a celebrity, take the time to analyze it before passing it on or accepting it as fact.
- And even if you think their heart is in the right place, be sure that their information is coming from sources that have a track record of honesty.

The reality of the situation gives us a deep insight into how the majority think with a lack of thought and introspection.
We're all in this together. It's our basic duty to ensure we're all making the sensible decisions and not allowing rumors to take the seed, everyone‚Äôs lives depend on it, thanks!",1585547298.0,,Coronavirus,dark,0,11

There are manual ventilators where people manually pump air, this has been used in emergencies like hurricane Katrina.

I was thinking, since India has such a high population, why don't we test a large group of people, those who are negative should be isolated so that they don't get Corona. These large group of people should be trained on how to manual ventilation, estimates should be made how many people would be required to ventilate a person 24*7 in rotational shifts. 

Once shit hits the fan, these teams can be deployed, when one person gets tired another takes his place.

These people can be isolated from the person they are ventilating, for example if the person is in a railway coach isolation ward, then the manual ventilation device can be outside the boggy and only the pipe carrying the air can go inside.

We can use our large population dividend to our advantage.

1736,"Ur fascism and its parallels with HindutvaWas reading Ur fascism by Umberto Eco during quarantine and found similarities between the characteristics of eternal fascism he listed and Hindutva movement, current and former. It might look like a stretch as we are far from and may never be near the extreme elements of fascism as history knows it, but its worth to see parallels, even in soft form. For many Hindutva proponents, Modi is India, or being Hindu is being Indian; just like previous authoritarian stage we went through, Indira is India.

https://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf

>Fascism  was  a  fuzzy  totalitarianism,  a  collage  of
4different philosophical and political ideas, a beehive of contradictions. Can one conceiveof a truly totalitarian movement that was able to combine monarchy with revolution, theRoyal Army with Mussolini's personal milizia, the grant of privileges to the Church withstate education extolling violence, absolute state control with a free market? 

Eco's 14 general properties

>1.""The Cult of Tradition"", characterized by cultural syncretism, even at the risk of internal contradiction. 

The call for unity among all caste of Hinduism yet there are contradicting instances of casteism in itself.

>2.""The Rejection of modernism"", 

Disdain towards modern medicine, history and technology to see them as something West took from centuries old knowledge in Vedas. Esp in this time, Modi pushing for AYUSH placebo at time of Corona.

>3.""The Cult of Action for Action's Sake"", which dictates that action is of value in itself

Support for demonetization, mismanagement of economy and now the migrant condition during Corona.

>4.""Disagreement Is Treason"" ‚Äì Fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action

Anyone who disagrees is an 'antinational', 'libtard', 'Pakistani', 'presstitute'. And of course, contempt for intellectuals coz 'Hardwork is greater than Harward'.

>5.""Fear of Difference"", which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.

Hindutva disregards everyone other than Hindus as rightful owners of Indian subcontient, coz its not their 'pithrubhoomi'. And in Hindutva history reading, the invasion foreigner angle stops with Mughals, or rather Muslims, and strangely excludes British coz they found them as allies against the 'real invaders'.

>6.""Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class"", fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.

Superpower 2020, Rupee will be powerful than dollar etc. etc. Plus, on the social anxiety side, constant pedalling of a future with bigger influence of Indian culture on world.

>7.""Obsession with a Plot"" and the hyping-up of an enemy threat. 

Pakistan! No Muslim is a true Indian coz their great grandfathers voted for Muslim league. Also 'Urban Naxals'.

>8.Fascist societies rhetorically cast their enemies as ""at the same time too strong and too weak."" On the one hand, fascists play up the power of certain disfavored elites to encourage in their followers a sense of grievance and humiliation. On the other hand, fascist leaders point to the decadence of those elites as proof of their ultimate feebleness in the face of an overwhelming popular will.

Some similar arguments that seem to be cope for insecurities among Hindutva proponents here - Hindus are a stronger, older, tolerant and majority against Muslims here. Still they ruled us in past, destroyed templed and now enjoy privilages as minority. Still Hindus are surviving, world is adapting old knowledge in vedas. We are CEOs of biggest corporations in the world.

>9.""Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy"" because ""Life is Permanent Warfare"" ‚Äì there must always be an enemy to fight.This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.

Hindu India and Muslim India argument here. Since one can't get rid of the enemy, they should dominate and ostracise them.

>10.""Contempt for the Weak"", which is uncomfortably married to a chauvinistic popular elitism, in which every member of society is superior to outsiders by virtue of belonging to the in-group.

Caste elitism, worlds oldest civilization, poor people deserve this, they are making India look bad by walking during Corona etc etc

>11.In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm.

Bal Narendra, 56 inch vs Pappu

>12.""Machismo"", which sublimates the difficult work of permanent war and heroism into the sexual sphere. Fascists thus hold ""both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.""

Couldn't find parallels as such. But the over masculinisation of Hindu gods, like image of Lord Vishnu from lovable Makhan chor to battlefield Gita one comes to mind. Also, women are considered to be the forebearers of tradition, anyone who goes against is name called and shown as 'moden woman' who is influenced by the west.

>13.Selective populism - For  Ur-Fascism,  however,  individuals  as  individuals  have  no  rights,  and  thePeople is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Sinceno  large  quantity  of  human  beings  can  have  a  common  will,  the  Leader  pretends  to  betheir interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called  on  to  play  the  role  of  the  People. 

everything is for the greater good

>14.Newspeak

New vocabulary like mentioned before to silence criticism and fake news factories with various tiers of shit to propagate the propaganda and attack any form of dissent.

**Tl;dr**

Multiple press reports have emerged on ""lists"" of persons placed under quarantine who are suspected to be infected with Covid-19. Many of these lists have been circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, primarily those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. The circulation of this information is a ¬†breach of personal privacy and is exposing such quarantines to second order harms. To address it we have urged the Ministry of Health; Ministry of Urban Development and Housing; and ¬†the National Real Estate Development Council (NARDECO) to urgently issue advisories. ¬†  


**Time to stop, spy the neighbour!**

It is day 6 of a national lockdown to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Repeated calls are being made public officials to maintain social solidarity and offer support. This spirit of social cooperation is jarring to the indiscriminate sharing of lists of persons who are suffering from Covid-19 infection; or, are suspected of being carriers; or, fall within a risk category due to recent travel. These lists of persons are being principally shared through digital means. This increases the field of dissemination of personally identifiable information and can lead to acute harm. 

Several press reports have emerged that such lists are being circulated on social media and WhatsApp groups, principally those formed by Resident Welfare Associations and Group Housing Societies. Further compounding this problem is that many of these lists seem to have been compiled by departments in State Governments and published on websites or, ""leaked"". 

These lists are not uniform and while may not contain the name of the person do contain personally identifiable information such as the addresses and the relatives of such persons. It is enabling discrimination, denial of essential health care and food items and even leading to instances where persons placed under quarantine are being placed under pressure of eviction by landlords and apartment societies.

We placed reliance on specific provisions of law including the Supreme Court's 9 judge bench privacy judgement, provisions of Indian Medical Council Regulations and the Information Technology Act. Here much of our thought has been shaped by the leadership of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan that[**has written a representation on March 23, 2020.**](http://phmindia.org/2020/03/23/jsa-statement-on-breach-of-confidentiality-around-coronavirus-cases/)

Beyond a breach of law, is a poor public policy choice at the time of a pandemic. Sharing of information weakens social solidarity that is needed to counter this shared and unprecedented social challenge. It is literally turning neighbour against neighbour. 

We believe that state responses can be crafted while protecting the fundamental right to privacy as guaranteed under the Constitution. In our constitutional framework, one of the core values to advance the aims of social justice is of, fraternity. This value in ambedkarite thought has been [**explained by Shiveshwar Kundu**](https://roundtableindia.co.in/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=9561:ambedkar-s-tryst-with-fraternity&catid=129&Itemid=195) as, ""\[c\]entral to this idea of fraternity is the *notion of friendship*."" By releasing such lists containing personally identifiable information, this notion of social collegiality is replaced by private vigilantism. It undermines the founding ethos of our republic is beautifuly contained in Narsi Mehta‚Äôs poem [***Vaishnav Jan To Tene Kahiye***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaishnava_Jana_To) that was often sung as a hym by Gandhi jee as a call for practiced empathy.

I have been a member of this community for so long and I love this community for its progressive thoughts. I wanted to get something off my chest and also ask you folks' opinion.

I have held this off inside me for too long but today want to put it out. My father is a narcissist and manipulative person. He hasn't worked in his entire life and has only done few menial jobs for very less time. My mother has struggled hard to raise me by securing a government job with her father's and brother's efforts.

However, father has been abusive and manipulative to her and she has put up with it because of Indian society, chaar log kya kahenge bla bla. I hadn't recognised this before or tried to ignore it thinking it will be ok later and also I stay away from them since I work in a faraway city and visit them once in a while.  This time due to corona effect I had to travel since I stay alone and can't cook for shit.

Today morning again he started with his bullshit about some silly reason to her and I couldn't hold any longer and got into an argument with him to defend her. The shouting match prevailed and neighbour could hear us. After this, I realized that this is not good so I sat and tried to reason with him for almost three hours and also apologised for shouting at him. But he got only defensive and never discussed his actual feeling out but instead started blaming me and my mother about everything. It's strange that he doesn't even recognize that it is her and to some extent my hard work that is putting the food on the table.

I don't know how I will continue for remaining 15-16 days like this and how to help my mother also. Any thoughts and suggestions are greatly appreciated. Thanks for reading the long post.",1585554976.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,34,35

1. Thousands of untraceable immigrants. 
2. Very low rate of testing.
3. Nature of disease to grow exponentially.

The only solution at this stage is 

1. to provide masks and gloves to every single citizen of the country

2. let them continue working, making social distancing a rule 

3. isolate people above 60 to not let them come out till there is a vaccine or medicine or sufficient no of ventilators.

I work in the medical field myself, though in an administrative position more than healing, so i can tell you the lock down did have some benefits, but i see no realistic way to fix things after it is finished?

&#x200B;

Would the government extend it more?

I personally don't think that's realistic as well as India as a country would not manage, not due to social needs, but for personal ones, as in food and supplies that are dwindling for those in need, as not everything can be delivered, and some of the things which are essential for some people are not considered as essential by the government.

&#x200B;

Some people like the cab drivers would defiantly not manage after this ends if it is extended.

What we realised was that it takes atleast 5 people 24/7 to look after a patient and to keep the household working. I was looking after my father 24/7; everything related to his medical care, visiting doctors, purchasing medicines, administering medicines, looking after oxygen cylinder and supply, washing him etc. My Mom was looking after his food and cleaning the rooms and clothes, my sister was looking after purchasing groceries and anything related to household items and also looking after her kid, her husband was working and was the only source of income, we has a housemaid who cooked for everyone else in the house and was helping my sister.

This is what it looks like when there is a terminally ill patient in the house. My father passed ways after almost 2 years of struggle. By that time I was almost bankrupt, not to mention the mental and physical toll it takes on everyone in the house.

Anyway, the reason I mentioned this is because with the COVID-19 pandemic there will be two categories of sufferers, those who have COVID-19 with underlying health issues who are in danger of losing life, and the others who are not COVID-19 affected but still are suffering from serious illnesses such as ILD, COPD, Cancer, HIV etc. How are the patients and their families coping?

Clearly the central government has failed to team up with many states to provide reliable source of essentials, which will soon make the situation very difficult, once majority runs out of food and essentials.

On the other hand, alcohol and cigarettes are not covered under essentials, even though we have one of the biggest consumer market for such things. Lot of people, including daily wage workers are highly dependent on alcohol. Problems arising due to withdrawal symptoms in addicts,  will only weaken our efforts to push down covid 19, as they will flood outside to either get alcohol in black market or go to the hospital because of withdrawal sickness. Also this could become one of the leading causes for domestic violence. Countries like US, Italy and UK included alcohol in essentials.

I by no means want to imply that the lock down was not necessary, because it is the only way to stop a virus pandemic, but could it have been planned better? YESS!

even though the PM apologised for his actions, it does not change the fact that millions are still without shelters, food and daily wages.

Understood that we are a developing nation, and we had to take drastic measures to tackle covid 19, however I would like to get honest opinions and future projections about how the current situation may pan out.

1861,"Frustrated at not being able to get liquor during lockdown, 2 commit suicide in KarnatakaIn continuing cases of tipplers in the southern states ending their lives due to non-availability of liquor during the lockdown, two men committed suicide in Karnataka's Dakshina Kannada district.

The two suicides were reported in Kadaba taluk on Saturday, police said.

Tomy Thomas (50), a rubber tapping labourer in an estate at Kutrupadi village of the taluk, was found hanging at his rented house on Saturday. Thomas, a native of Kottayam in Kerala, had joined at the estate here a month ago.

Local people said he was desperately moving around in the last few days asking about places where he can get liquor. He had also not reported to work in these days. The body has been kept at the mortuary of a hospital at Deralakatte.

In another incident, a 70-year old man, belonging to Kodimbala village in the taluk, allegedly hanged himself from the branch of a tree near his house at Nakur.

The deceased has been identified as Thomas, who had left his family here 30 years ago and had been working in Kerala. He had returned here only a few years back.

Sources said Thomas, an alcohol addict, was having health problems related to withdrawal. He has been living on pavements at Kadaba without going home.

Kadaba police has registered cases in connection with the two incidents.

Incidents of tipplers committing suicide have been reported in Kerala and Telangana in the past few days. Two men ended their lives in Kerala today while a 50-year old daily wage worker jumped to death from a building in Hyderabad on Friday.

1879,"Why are we not testing to our capabilities right now? Only 35k tets done for 1.3 billion people.I recently came across a post here in which A screening doctor said that only 2-3 out of 200 people were being tested. I can only think this is due to lack of testing kits.
 But all the countries which have successfully controlled  this pandemic have carried out large scale testings early on.

Come on take a minute and laugh at these joke of numbers
India( 1. 3 bil) - 35k tests
South korea (51 mil) - 316k tests
Germany (83 mil) - 200k tests
Norway (4.8 mil) - 50k tests
India has done less no. Of tests than Norway

I live in a small town - Samastipur, Bihar and we just heard that people that are found as suspected cases can't even be tested here. And they are sent out to other cities for testing.

I'm just scared that even if my family is in quarantine
(except my father who's in a bank, and he has to go every day), due to absence of these medical testing facilities along with items like masks and sanitizers
I can't keep my family safe.

And it scares the living shit out of me

3. Companies to move away from the idea of internationalisation. This is where employment in India can get a very bad hit.

1921,"Spare a Moment for Sorrow - Amid the chaos, take time to grieve our collective losses. (Worth a Read)Not Mine. Taken from [Source](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archve/2020/03/the-grieving-world/609013/)

If you have ever lost someone you loved, you know the feeling of seeing the world through a bank teller‚Äôs glass. You observe other people laughing and enjoying their day, but you are apart from them, separated by a thick, bulletproof barrier. You wonder how they can savor that plate of pasta or play music that loud, given what‚Äôs happened.

Normally the experience is isolating, but in our new coronavirus world, we‚Äôre all on the same side of the glass. Every day, we are in contact with the suffering of others. Even if you don‚Äôt know anyone who has died, or have a loved one who you are worried will die, you have read about the growing number of deaths in America. If you are like me, your mind can‚Äôt help but imagine the people at the other end of those numbers. Today a woman became a widow. A daughter never got to say goodbye to her father. A son answered his mother‚Äôs request for a blanket, the last words she would ever say to him. For many thousands, today will be one of the hinge points of their life; everything will be defined as either ‚Äúbefore‚Äù or ‚Äúafter.‚Äù

The blast radius of a single death is bigger than we might think. There are the neighbors who burn a candle in the window in solidarity with the family fretting the phone call that might come in the night. There is the retiree who has lost a bridge partner. The nurses and doctors fighting this virus have to shoulder the emotional load for every call to frantic relatives looking for a sign of hope. They also have to deliver the bad news.

Death and suffering surround us all the time, but typically the mourning are not in danger of being trampled by public debate. These deaths are now front-page news, fodder for Twitter fights or cable pundits. And many of us are distracted, enraged, scared, or just doing what we can to manage a full plate of immediate worries. But in this period, we should spare a moment for sorrow and grief. This is the human thing to do; it is what following through on the pledge to be in this together actually means.

If we spare a moment, we give our neighbors the simple communal feeling of being seen in their loss. If we spare a moment, we minimize the risk of sending a public signal to those who have just lost their world that the rest of the world is indifferent to their suffering. If we spare a moment, we acknowledge that the national push to find solutions and get back to normal at some point, as reasonable as that is, is impossible for many.

Ideally a public figure would use his platform, as heroic leaders have in the past, to set this tone. In the absence of that, perhaps we can all use our platforms, whether they be Twitter or the family text chain, to say what I have tried to say here: that we feel your loss and sorrow, even if words are too clumsy. And when words fail altogether, a moment of silence can say You‚Äôre not alone, even in a moment of deep loneliness.

The test of a time like this is that it either drives us toward our common humanity, or it drives us apart. Let it be the former.",1585491536.0,,Coronavirus,dark,0,15

What people fail to realise in India as seen with the Delhi elections is that we pay taxes for a reason. Every Indian irrespective of his income slab pays taxes, directly or indirectly.

2003,"A simple cocktail recipe to lift your spirits this lockdown.So I'm a big proponent of drinking Jagermeister like a snob rather than a party shot. I'm not a fan of uncultured swines downing it in nightclubs or making jagerbombs.

I keep a bottle at all times in the freezer (yes, the difference between refrigerated and sub-zero Jager is heaven and hell).

My usual style of drinking it is pouring it in a whisky/small glass completely filled with ice. The advantage of that is that I get a super-cold but reasonably strong drink which mellows down with each sip over an hour.

Today I tried experimenting with a basic desi cocktail and the result was pretty good, so I thought that I'd share it with you guys.

Ingredients:

Rose syrup, Jagermeister (obviously), a lemon and ice.

How to make:

The cocktail is very simple and the order is largely unimportant, so you can change the quantities around to get a result that you like, but here's what I did:

1. Pour 10ml of rose syrup
2. Add 30ml of jager
3. Mix it with 30ml of cold water to balance the sweetness of the syrup
4. Pour mix on a glass filled with ice, and sprinkle a lemon on top.

Notes: I think grated ginger would also be a good addition to this mix. I've also considered switching the rose syrup and lemon with thandai syrup and seeing how that goes.",1585484938.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,5,11

My sister who is in shutdown back home with my family gets a text from her bank at 12:12 am that her account has been debited with a transaction for 4 lac rs. Upon checking her online banking we find out that its a online transaction for a e commerce website from the US - AAFES ( kind of like the army canteens in India)
Axis bank is completely unreachable through any of their channels - online chat, toll free number or even their fraud report portal.
The police though cooperative even past midnight were helpless and asked us to go to the cyber crime tomorrow morning.
Now here‚Äôs the situation-
My sister just lost a very large amount from her hard earned savings
The bank is unreachable 
Police have bounced us off to the cyber crime
And to top it all off, tomorrow is going to be interesting with all the restrictions because of the shutdown.
I know it‚Äôs a waiting game now, but just feeling helpless and frustrated.
Interrogated my sister and turns out she has not shared OTP or any other details, also we did not get any pre transaction alerts - so we don‚Äôt even know how the scammers pulled this off. Also, they shopped on a website exclusively for US army personnel. 
No idea how they did this, or what our options are, hopefully the bank will be cooperative tomorrow morning.
And for the scammers - no amount of expletives do justice to how low they can fall by stealing from others, especially in times which are tense and stressful enough. Seriously, who thinks this is a good time to steal ?
Anyway, rant aside, if anyone has any advice or helpful tips on how we can retrieve the money - please please let me know.

It has a huge amount of poor people who also bring huge labour thanks to these people we get our food,supplies they unload/load things,drive them to us and what not.


There seems to a thing going around people are thinking after lockdown ends corona is over! this is the biggest problem it will be utter chaos the sheer number of people will make it impossible for the police to deal with when the lockdown does end. How are poor people even being quaratined are you telling me we do have the infrastructure and personnel to quarantine them? they will all stashed into a big hall probably with no proper food,water and toilets no  electricity. But the media will show a few photos showing they are doing well.


Usa and china two hugely populated countries in usa the virus is spreading at a ridiculous pace and china is reporting there are no new cases which is the biggest bullshit these countries cannot deal with this even with huge infrastructure and personnel.


In India there are 125 police for 1,00,000 so 125 police for 1 lakh people go look at screen of 125 people and then look at 1 lakh one also many of these 125 police serve vips... other numbers on google said there 1 doctor for every 1457 citizen.. we have a 1.3 billion people do the math and how many of these server our vips do the math.


Things like repair shops being closed hurts a shitload of indians now if u have a wire burn in your home and you lose electricity you are done.. no mechanic to repair it gl expecting a government employee to fix a wire in your home if your pressure cooker breaks u now have to use gas for cooking rice which if you use cylinder will run out in a month. Lockdown or no our healthcare will collaspe a huge amount of poor people will die and suffer and then die or have permanently damaged lungs. Our supplies which we are getting are simply not gonna last.


There were reports of 1500 clusters(satsang) then 20000 then 40000 and then it hit slums with a population of 1 lakh then seprately poor migrant workers are migrating all over the place without them you wont get any supplies at all people don't grasp this. 


We didn't even hear how badly things are going in china because they suppress everything they could have served us as advanced warnings during lockdowns but now our mistakes will used by other populated countries to avoid disaster. Then we have lairs people with symptoms who will ignore them and carry on spreading their virus everywhere until its too late. People here on r/india think china handled its lockdown perfectly and nothing went wrong.

The only thing to hope for is our medical professional survive without them there are always other diseases which will kill you. Now it's like being thrown into a pit of lions if you have good immune system which is kinda genetic luck based and a good lifestyle plus low pollution which we lack.

So, this rules out businesses like consultancies, service providers, and its likes.

Now that's done.

#### What should I do during COVID-19?

As founders, we have innate nature to find problems and fix them. The current scenario might drive you to do this more. Here is a hard tk swallow truth. Firstly, you don't have access to the kind of resources needed to tackle this pandemic. Secondly, the next best thing you can do is keep your eye on the goal and make sure this pandemic doesn't kill your business. We spent our resources and it did very little. Rather it didn't have as much impact as we had hoped. |<We scrapped the project. Be swift and decisive.>|

#### If you are running on fumes with very little cash left then you are likely looking for ways to keep your business alive. What will happen to a startup after this pandemic ends?

Other than raising funds or loan, you should look into merger with another firm of similar size. This will enhance net value as a merger should always have one outcome viz **sum is greater than the parts**.

If this seems impossible in the current situation then you can align your ship with big guns that are most likely to benefit from acquisition of your business.

I hope you don't have to go for either of these. But as a founder one has to hope for the best and prepare for the worst.

#### You may want to persevere. It is hard to build what we are doing. What do we do?

You need to clean your workplace. Fire anyone that doesn't add significant value. Find just the skeleton crew that will keep you lean and afloat. Anyone that is not putting every last cell of their body to keep the startup afloat should be let go. There shouldn't be anyone at this stage that is not putting such effort.

But what's done is done and there's no use debating it further, atleast until all of this blows over.

What I am worried about is people feeling like they are being repressed against their best interests and retaliating en masse.

Currently, the people are ignoring the Lockdown due to two reasons.

1. They don't understand the seriousness of the situation. 

2. They don't have enough supplies and/or are worried about their survival

The Police cracking down on them using violence might instill the idea that the Lockdown is implemented not for their benefit. A lack of certainty about essential commodities adds more fuel to the fire. Reading about the situation in Goa, I couldn't help but feel that the people are on the verge of their breaking point. And if the situation in the Hospitals reaches a point where, like in Italy, the Doctors have to choose whose life to save, I can't imagine how the people would react.

I don't mean to cause unnecessary panic or worry to the people reading this post.

Buying Furniture- High initial cost, packing and moving (might be reimbursed by the company) or hassle of selling it while shifting.

Renting- Not sure about furniture rental and 3-4 year rental costs might be high.

Furnished house- Premium of around 3-4k/month over an unfurnished house. Comes to 1.1-1.5 lakhs for 3 years.

There's also an option of a semi-furnished house. Why appliances/furniture would you say is worth buying, and which ones would you consider worth renting/demanding (in furnished house).",1585474151.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,5,7

I'm terribly bored and was brainstorming ideas for maybe launching a new startup once India is out of this crisis. So after mulling over a lot of ideas I discovered that India does not have a sneaker rental platform at all. I'm wondering why isn't it there? Sneaker renting allows a LOT of people outside the dedicated sneakerhead community to try on hyped sneakers for just a temporary time( maybe for a party or to impress a date?) at just a fraction of the cost of purchasing a new pair of sneakers only to wear it a few times and then let it sit and collect dust. So I'm wondering what if such an e-platform existed  for renting sneakers?

What happened in Bangalore on Wednesday:

1. Video surfaces of two youth beating two cops on the road during the lock down, everyone bays for their blood and call to hang them in public for beating cops on duty. Media runs amok saying such people should be made an example of, don't spare them, the usual media mileage.
2. Youth arrested immediately, Police Commissioner says they were performing wheelies on empty roads and attacked cops when stopped. Sent to jail under stringent sections. Rowdy sheets opened against them, which means their future is screwed.
3. Day later, video surfaces on Facebook showing what happened *before* the youth attacked the cops. They are seen been kicked around by the cops, feet stamped with police boots, pockets emptied, all the while they're pleading with the cops to let them go. This video is shot by someone from a balcony. Obviously something triggered them to fight back.
4. No media attention to this video, no explanation from cops. The youth in jail, obviously beaten to a pulp by the cops. Future gone.
5. On Thursday: youth taken to scene of crime for re-creation of events. Apparently they attacked a police woman with stones and had to be shot in the leg!
6. Some folks on FB are trying to bring this to the notice of media and higher authorities to get them some justice.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_number_of_military_and_paramilitary_personnel

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_enforcement_in_India

Even if you assume that all police officers are deployed and 50% of our non-police forces are tasked with duties, that still leaves us with enough forces to double the number of troops on the ground without breaking a sweat.

These troops could be tasked with ensuring the smooth functioning of the lockdown:

1. Management of inter-state migrations during the lockdown
2. Door to door supply of rations
3. General policing duties in areas with an absurdly low police:population ratio.

Many organisations are also run on a semi-voluntary basis, i.e. there is no fixed salary. So other than logistics and organisation costs, there would be no significant increase in the burden of the exchequer.

https://www.coursera.org/degrees/bachelor-of-science-computer-science-london

I'm very into startup so I gave up University to code. Currently, I freelance and I'm working on my startup which I'm very very passionate about.

Job wise, I hate it. Freelancing sucks, to be honest.
But it's better than working for a company. I never will like working for someone, that's very obvious to me. 
But money-wise, I get paid well.

My parents keep pointing out that I don't have a degree.
I have heard it so many times even though I make in 1 month what my dad does in 4.
It's embarrassing when they mention it to people that I'm close to mid-20s son who doesn't have a degree.
Sometimes even taunts me that a degree was hard so I couldn't handle the pressure.
Truth is I knew what I wanted and I went for it, just dropped out to pursue it. 

So I was thinking of taking part in this course. The price seems reasonable to me.

This degree timings seem like heaven. I could spare that time and still work on my startup and freelance.
But this is a degree just for the sake of getting a degree.
I'm not sure if I should go for it or I'm just wasting my savings.

2229,"Harrassed by Sector 99 Mohali landlord's sister who wishes death to my familyThis goes back to november, but since the lady who rented out her brother's flat had harrassed me so much I am making a public account of it. She has threatened to fabricate stories, wished my parents were dead. She abused me for 2-3 weeks straight and I have decided not to stay quiet anymore as she is vindictive and I believe very jealous.

The  12 month lease was under my father's name as he was the sole tenant. Payable according to the rent were: monthly rent (13500 rupees), electricity and water. There was no mention of any maintenance. The  building was under Puma  realtors who absconded and the owners who took possession of the flats were tasked with maintaining it. Soon there were all kinds of meetings, elections amongst flat owners  to form a committee, and implement mini money making schemes amongst themselves.  For example, Puma realtors left an unpaid electricity bill of 13 lakhs, which gave impetus to side money making schemes in the guise of ""repayment""

My father paid half the year's maintenance unknowingly, as this woman(Amarjeet Raina Bujrall) would send a utility man to collect money each month (about 2500 rupees I believe).  My father thought he was paying tip/bakhshish to the garbage man, guards for their roti/paani.  Instead he paid half a year's maintenance in cash, unknowingly.

Rent was only late  1 month by 2 weeks, because I was traveling out of India and had to send someone physically to the bank, as the account only accepts direct deposits (NRO/NRI account).  The time the rent was late was also when there were floods in Punjab. Her

At some point this lady started pestering my father to vacate the flat as she wanted to take tuitions there. She began badgering him to leave 3 months before the end of the lease. He is a patient with a long lasting condition and her constant badgering was not good for his health.  She would repeatedly call him and talk about his mental state, pushing him. He called me up  more than once and I decided to move him immediately because at around the same time she started insinuating what would happen if he died. I packed and moved him and left the keys with the guard. The flat was fully cleaned and pictures and a video were taken .

I did not inform her, because of her toxic behavior and extremely abusive tone. Her husband and her are bankrupt I believe at this point.

The  rent, electricity and water were fully paid.  She bought up maintenance  and upon  re-reading the lease I let her no that maintenance was not part of the lease. She even wanted 5 rupees per transaction for the money that was deposited as rent! At this point she starts attacking me personally, wishes my family ill and goes to the police station and makes an inspector call. I told the inspector if she has a case, she should get a lawyer. Her vitriol on whatsapp at this point had been going on for 2- 3 weeks.

Couple of things:

1. She has repeatedly threatened me which leads me to believe she will try to sabotage my work/life by fabricating stories. She 'gaslights' and has zero qualms about lying
2. I am a Canadian. She has also threatened to sue me in Canada. I have informed the border control as nobody goes on a tourist visa with the intention of suing. Also I am not even on the lease.
3. Her brother or she has given NO receipts. I have bank deposit slips. Are they evading taxes?
4. I have messaged her on whatsapp of March and let her know that her abuse and threats will not remain in private anymore. Abusers get away with far too much in private. And she's somehow led herself to believe that she's ""morally right""
5. Her abuses are the typical jealous woman kind. They center around my work, how much money I make, my family's health, marital status etc.  She also takes special interest in belittling my elderly father.
6. She is not very intelligent and doesn't have the capacity to understand any reasoning. ABSOLUTELY DUMB. She is the one who made the lease in which no maintenance is mentioned. I tried to reason with her, but have of March let her know that her abuse/threats won't remain  private
7. Some of her abuses:

* Calling my father ""Gursikh Parkinson's"" (because of parkinson's disease),  being derogatory to my parents
* Calling me a bitch
* Calling us absconders, freeloaders
* Telling me she will go to any lengths to harm me
* Stating that the rising corona cases in USA  are high and implying that I should get corona (as I sometimes visit there)
* Her immediate neighbors have insinuated that she is abusive to her kids and other people's kids. So abuse is probably all that she knows.

She does NOT have the money for a lawyer. Going to the police is free. However, never underestimate jealousy and vindictiveness.

What are some other steps that I should take to protect myself? I have put up a public record of her behavior to safe guard myself since I do take threats seriously",1585505772.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,11,22

I am currently pursuing my Graduation in the USA. 
As you might be aware, it's difficult to live here owing to the current conditions with the corona Virus thing.

I wanted some guidance from my fellow Indians living in the States. 

My roommate is working off campus in a liquor store. Don't know what type of people he interacts with daily. I requested him a lot to refrain from working for atleast a period of 1 month or so. But he is not willing to listen. I am afraid he might catch up the virus, which can indirectly affect me too.  I don't have any friends near by with whom I can shift with either. 
Its been a bad situation and he seems to be much money oriented(given that off campus working is not allowed for International students). 
What can be done in this situation? I am not jealous that he is making money, good for him. I am worried with the virus situation.

If you ask experts, even the best case scenario they're giving is that of at least July/August and there are no guarantees even after that. The trouble is that this virus has moved beyond the point of containment now, so we have only three options available:

1. Wait for a vaccine or cure (which is still years away from materializing).
2. Create herd immunity among Indians by letting the virus loose and infecting at least 2/3rd of our population (that way, the problem will be solved but the cost will be millions of deaths which no government will allow).
3. Keep on practicing social distancing until a vaccine or cure comes out (because otherwise, corona will catch you the moment you step out and we're back to square one).

There are practical limitations to how long we can follow point 3. The rich will have no problem but what about the poor and middle income groups? At some point, sheer bread earning is going to become a problem, how can we earn our daily life sustenance if we're stuck at our homes?

What can the next generation of entrepreneurs do to make our fundamentals and basics strong? And by fundamentals I mean absolute fundamentals. Like clean water, electricity, food supply network, medicine, hospitals and infrastructure (roads and trains) and education in every single village.

We won our independence more than 70 years ago, and have for too long relied on foreign countries to uplift us and our economy. It‚Äôs time we take action!

2438,"Misconceptions about South Korean approach to COVID containment (as compared to India's).Firstly, I am Indian and have lived in Korea for ~5 years. In this threat I want to draw attention to differences in Indian and Korean approach to COVID containment. I am doing this because I have seen lot of whatsapp forwards and talked to few friends and relative who think that Indian approach is more or less same as South Korea.

Before I get started, I want to clarify I am not criticizing any of two approach. This is comparison with respect to what is currently considered best practice. I understand circumstances limit how well it can be copied in India.

**Testing**

India: Must be international traveler or have come in contact with infected person. Recently, pneumonia cases are also allowed to be tested.

Korea: Anyone can get tested. If you have any symptoms, you call a number, they direct you to nearest center. A doctor check you and if symptoms match, you get test for free. Additionally, if   you come in contact of any infected person, you get test for free. If you are just worried and want to get tested, you pay ~120$.

**Treatment Cost**

India: I have no information on this.

Korea: ~40$ if you have national insurance. ~1400$ if you don't. All citizens have it. ~50% foreigners have it.*

**Shut Down**

Korea: There is no broad shut down. Large gatherings (events, protest, etc.), religious congregations and karaoke are banned.#

India: Ya all know.

**Delivery**

India: Shit show.
Korea: No limitation what so ever. Encouraged.

Personal comment: Why the f govt. cares if someone want to order non essential stuff from amazon?

**Tracking & Isolation**

India: Wholesale isolation of anyone and everyone. Release excel files and put stickers, broadcasting the isolation of person/household.

Korea: If you are coming from COVID infected area, you must isolated for 14 days.^ If someone is found to be infected, his movement are traced and made public. If you live in same district or have visited it, you get message informing you off same. You can check the same online for each individual patient. 

**Business**

India: Shut down everything with limited exception.

Korea: No restriction. If someone is found to be infected, it is shut down for disinfection and things are back on soon.

**WFH**

India: Idk how common is this

Korea: Encouraged but not very common. Schools are closed, university is online.

""It is quite disturbing to see videos and reports about people still not fully complying with the all India lockdown!,"" the 35-year-old star said. 

Concerned with the increase in the number of positive coronavirus cases in the country, the actor added, ""as conscious citizens of the nation we should be extremely responsible and should take care of each other to fight COVID-19.""

""This is not the time to be irresponsible because such actions will put the lives of many in danger,"" the 'Shubh Mangal Saavdhan' actor added.

The National Film Award winner also urged everybody to stay indoors till the said lockdown period and to take care of themselves and also the close-ones.

""We shouldn't be rash in our behavior because it will put our lives and lives of countless many in peril. I urge us to stand united and ensure we protect India and Indians,"" he concluded.

Like Ayushmann, many Bollywood stars are currently practicing self-isolation in view of the 21-day-long government-imposed lockdown.

Mostly you here people who's mother tongue is Hindi or related language pronounce it as Kannad. But Kannada (‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°) im Hindi is Kannad (‡§ï‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§°‡§º). So many people who pronounce Kannad do so because that's what they think is right. 

And tbh it's pretty common all around the world. French, Spanish  and German is actually Espanol, Francais and Deutsche in their own native languages. 

That doesn't mean you shouldn't inform the people who pronounce it as Kannad. But i really get suprised when ppl get all defensive or even snobbish when someone calls Kannada as Kannad.

2525,"Hi, I watched a Khan Academy video and tried to calculate the actual infected people in India. Info from Worldometers and who.Disclaimer: I'm not a statistics person. This information could be wrong.

I'm fed up with the government hiding the actual figures, luckily I came across the Khan academy video where he tries to calculate the actual cases in his county. Video in question: [https://youtu.be/mCa0JXEwDEk](https://youtu.be/mCa0JXEwDEk). I did try to go through the medium article linked but found the video easier to understand.  
Anyways here are a few assumptions I've made.  


|Assumed Parameters|Value|Unit|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mortality Rate|1|percent|
|Time from Infection to Death|20|days|
|Doubling time|10|days|

&#x200B;

Morality Rate: let us assume 1%, so if there are 100 infected people one person will die. 

Time from infection to death: I've taken a conservative value of 20 days

Doubling time: This the number of days taken by the number of infected people to double. e.g. Assuming a value of 5 days. Say on day 10 there are 12 infected people, then on day 15, there will be 24 infected people. This again varies by country I've taken a conservative value 10.  


So the first death in India occurred on 12th March. So considering the 20 Days from infection to death and a mortality rate of 1% there should be at least 100 infected people on 21st Feb. During the same time, the total reported cases in India was 3. Now we can use basic math to calculate the possible infected cases in Inda. We can also vary the assumed parameters.

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Here are my results:

 \+ Mortality rate: 1% 

\+ Time from infection to death: 20 days

\+ Doubling time: 10 days

\++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

 \+ Mortality rate: 2% 

\+ Time from infection to death: 20 days

\+ Doubling time: 6 days 

I think this the most accurate representation, because WHO suggests that mortality rate is 3-4% it is 5% in UK, India has higher population of young people so 2% seems good. The next thing is given the high population and poor hygiene, 6 days of doubling time seems like a good figure.

2538,"Does anyone know how the PMNRF that we are all donating to (Prime Minister National Relief Fund) is utilised?In last year alone, PMNRF had a surpluse of 570.68 crores in 2018-19. As per the FAQs section, these funds can be utilised for medical assistance, floods, drought, terrorist violence and other unforeseen occurrences. Indians who are either affected by these calamities or who require financial aid for treatment of major diseases at Government/PMNRF empanelled hospitals can partially defray the expenses. Has anyone ever directly benefited by the scheme? Funny, FAQ Q18 reads as 'since a large number of requests are received seeking financial assistance for medical treatment, it is not possible to accommodate all requests due to limited resources.'
Limited resources? They had 570.68 crores in surplus from just one year? 
Also it is mentioned that the balance amount(which are significant surplus since 2011-12) is ""invested"" in various forms with scheduled banks and other agencies to ensure long term sustainability. So, about 75% of last year's funds are ""invested""?
We keep getting posts on r/india of doctors working with limited resources and have a lack of proper protective equipments. Why haven't been a lot of these funds transferred in times of crisis or better, for improvement of healthcare facilities? 
Does anyone know about how these funds are disbursed? Is there any answer to why such a huge amount is kept reserved? Has anyone ever directly received financial aids from this fund?

I am not even sure if I'll get the student visa and even if everything goes well, I might have problems finding a part time job in Canada/Europe or maybe I am wrong?

All over the world, governments have failed and private companies are now having to innovate and solve their way out of this.

Watch how the poor have to walk from cities to their villages to survive. Watch how they had to literally starve during Demon.

So nobody really knows when the pandemic will end but one this is for sure that when it does end the economies of the countries are going to be in the shitter. It‚Äôs going to take a huge toll on the resources and thereby lead to resource shortage. In this scenario do you people think the countries will go to war over resources? I‚Äôm sure most countries who have somewhat a strategic thought have already thought of this and perhaps are bracing for the impact. While the country is suffering now it is also important for it to stock itself as well if the possibility of war is real. So it makes sense that sooner the country deals with this the better it might be prepared to deal with the next tragedy in waiting. 

I just want to know what people here think. I‚Äôm trying not to make this post political cause the spin will be different but please understand most of the countries have right wing leaders who have a horrible human rights record. I‚Äôm not speaking all the countries but most like America, India, Brazil, most middle eastern nations etc. then we have the China Russia and Korea.

While looking for data sources, I realized that every similar project including the Wikipedia entry on this subject uses different conventions and different cut-off times to record the case numbers for every date. So I wanted to maintain an archive of the latest available case numbers from official sources (like MoHFW) only for each date, as much as reasonably possible.

Here is the result of this attempt: **[indiacovid19.github.io](https://indiacovid19.github.io/)**

Every entry on this page has a reference link as supporting evidence that points to an archived snapshot of the source of the numbers used in that entry.

   * So I would like to request you all to kindly call up the zoos in your area and inquire if they are well stocked. 
   * If they are not, please inform here (and on Twitter if you're active there). 
   * Left to itself, the government has higher priorities and will not bother about the animals. The matter can be brought to the attention of decision-makers and awareness raised, if necessary. 
   * I hate imprisoning animals in zoos, but I'd hate even more for them to starve. 

&#x200B;

* I have often seen street dogs, pigeons, cows, etc. roaming around looking for food, but unsuccessfully. 
   * So if there are animals around you that are going hungry, please do try to give them some food. 
   * Just some leftover rice will suffice for most creatures to survive. 
   * The situation is not so bad that we cannot spare a fistful of rice to save others from starving. 
   * Even for people who hate street dogs and pigeons - practically, a dead animal is a huge  public health and hygiene risk during these times, since no one is available to bury the carcass. 
   * Please raise awareness on this point among your friends, relatives, social circle, etc.

# Q. Why I'm against a re-run of Ramayan and Mahabharat?

Let's start with this 1-minute clip from ""Shut up ya Kunal Episode 6 - Ravish Kumar""

1-minute clip: [https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD](https://imgur.com/a/btZMFpD)

**Crowd manipulation** is the intentional use of techniques based on the principles of [crowd psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology) to engage, control, or influence the desires of a crowd in order to direct its behavior toward a specific action.   This practice is common to religion, politics, and business and can facilitate the approval or disapproval or indifference to a person,  policy, or product.  

Sorry to say but I'm against every re-run or any show be it Ramayan or Circus starring Shah Rukh Khan. While you are busy watching these shows you will cry when Lord Ram is left stranded in a jungle and when his feet will hurt after walking so much but you won't pay attention that the poor are stranded on the roads and they have to walk hundreds of km without any food and they are crying because they know they are gonna die. People are accusing China of hiding the actual number of casualties, Well you have no idea what's coming your way. This is the reason why Supreme leader is coming daily and doing stupid live sessions to keep you engaged.

# Q. What's the psychology behind India-Pakistan and Nehru debates?

 Let me introduce you to ""BIG LIE"", A psychological trick.

Hitler's psychological profile:

>His primary rules were: never allow the public to cool  off; never admit a fault or wrong; never concede that there may be some  good in your enemy; never leave room for alternatives; never accept  blame; concentrate on one enemy at a time and blame him for everything  that goes wrong; people will believe a big lie sooner than a little one;  and if you repeat it frequently enough people will sooner or later  believe it.

The above quote appears in the report, *A Psychological Analysis of Adolph Hitler: His Life and Legend,* by [Walter C. Langer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Charles_Langer) 

>Never to admit a fault or wrong; never to accept blame;  concentrate on one enemy at a time; blame that enemy for everything that  goes wrong; take advantage of every opportunity to raise a political  whirlwind

This is why the Supreme leader never accepts a mistake and keeps pressing on Congress and specifically Congress for everything. IT cells never allows you to cool down. 

# The questions you should be asking: 

1. Why we are not ready to tackle COVID-19 when we had months to prepare? 
2. Why people are stranded on roads?
3. Why doctors don't have PPE kits?
4. Why permission to make COVID-19 test kits was given to a company from Gujrat instead of other 18 companies who claimed to manufacture these kits at a lower price.
5. Why Prime Minister missed the key points in his speech when he announced the Lockdown which created Panic in the country? 
6. Why they gave you only 3 hours to prepare for the lockdown why an immediate press conference was conducted? 
7. Why Centre allocates ‚Çπ20,000 crore to develop Lutyens‚Äô Delhi amidst coronavirus crisis? 
8. Why we have not conducted enough tests? 
9. Why  Adityanath Govt Uses Epidemic Diseases Act to Arrest CAA Dissenter?
10. Why Dalits in Modi's constituency are eating grass in this lockdown? Why they don't have anything to eat?

2969,"This is how losing a war feels likeI am a doctor. I am currently posted in the 2nd line of reinforcements waiting to be deployed when (not if) the front line falls. We have completed our retraining, attended numerous debriefs, attended workshops on quarantine for yourself and family and discharged most of our inpatients and our wards are converted into isolation wards. Our posting to virus wards has been chalked out and plans for our own quarantine set. Now we just sit and wait.

Currently the cases are being managed by internal medicine and pulmonologist as the front line and other hospitalist like us are waiting in reserves.  The wait is a nerve-wracking one. We know that the numbers by the government aren't accurate and the wave will come anytime anyday. We are constantly checking the dashboard for the new cases trying to predict when that might be. It's terrifying especially when we have stopped most of our daily/ routine work (only emergencies are working) and have all the time in the world to think and ponder. 

The lockdown that was implemented was a good idea but it's just delaying the inevitable. Stopping a virus with Ro 2.5 (approx) is like trying to stop wind, you can slow it down sure but not stop it. Hospitals are trying to get PPE (it's ok atm Atleast here) but when push comes to shove it will be like Stalingrad where conscripts were thrown in front of machine guns without rifles or ammunitions. Testing is also very inadequate similar to what a war time goverment does to keep the morale up by not reporting bad news (which I am sure isn't their intention here). Testing criterias are ridiculous and labs don't test unless you follow them to the letter (their hands are tied). Outbreak in this country most likely won't be like Italy or the US. We don't know how much worse this may get here. Given the population density god help us. 

We are starting to have desertion amongst our ranks. Some have tried and got certificates from other doctors stating to have pre-existing conditions and won't be able to work. In response the Administration has appointed medical boards to look at such cases and decide the risk accordingly.

I have never read any memoirs of someone in a losing side of the war. It would have really helped to know how they fought this hopelessness and gloom that has disrupted our lives. We are constantly hearing  horrific stories from American and Italian doctors in internet and it feels a window to our future in coming days or weeks. I can't talk about this with my parents. I have decided to keep them in dark about this as much as I can. They are constantly checking the numbers in my city and hospital. I think they also know what's coming.

I can only hope for general winter (Indian summer in this case) to stop this overwhelming force or a successful clinical trial that could atleast give us something to fight with.

P.S: 
1. I honestly believe that the government did the best they could, not only ours but across the world. This is just too hard of a foe to best.
2. Sorry if this is too pessimistic I am trying share the experiences of me and my colleagues some predictions about near future which I hope isn't correct.",1585387294.0,,Coronavirus,dark,104,1024
2970,"Yesterday, many Indian retail traders got caught trading on the wrong side after Nifty opened 3.56% gap up ? Why did that happen and can you avoid it going forward ?Yesterday, most of the big and seasoned traders of Indian Stock market were either selling puts or buying calls at the market open expecting the market to go up. As these big traders have huge fan following on various social media platforms so when they shared their market analysis many small retail traders followed them and got trapped.

This is post is just to warn small retail traders who blindly follow big traders and try to copy them. The experienced and seasoned traders have their risks calculated behind every trade they enter into and even if the trade goes wrong they have firefighting skills in order to exit at breakeven or with minimum losses.

I would say that instead of blindly following others spend time in enhancing your trading skills and observe live charts daily to sense the market moves on your own. When you know the reason behind a trade entry then you will be more confident about it instead of taking a trade posted by someone else.

I am also a retail trader just like everyone else out there. But I trade based on my analysis and to give you yesterday's example my analysis was saying there will be correction at the market opening and thus exactly at 9.17 AM I posted below tweet from my Twitter account.

https://preview.redd.it/dorscic86dp41.jpg?width=598&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7a842da909215c271e429d6436ea55e2b18f3247

Moreover, at around 9.43 AM I was bearish on the market and had published another tweet related to #banknifty futures which is as follows.

https://preview.redd.it/zrne0sk96dp41.jpg?width=600&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=510aec46730cc23deb31462ac968ea6cec72d0d4

**What did market do after this ?**

\#BankNifty futures faced resistance 3 times from the exact same level (21057) which was posted well in advance and corrected more than 1300 points from there.

https://preview.redd.it/b85lscna6dp41.jpg?width=596&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c1e9d42262aab1cf0c5e9d037eead16cbe0f22e

This post is just to motivate small retail traders that you can be independent when it comes to analysing the markets. You just need to put in good efforts to attain right knowledge.

This is my first post on reddit and I don't know how it works out here.  Keep learning.

What would you like to tell your fellow citizens to do differently after all this lockdown ends? 


For starters, hmm I would suggest everyone to take this time to clean the locality around you, pick up all sorts of trash or fix anything that‚Äôs broken, and try to maintain the cleanliness once everyone is out there again. I would want all you guys to have stricter morals where you guys not only pollute but also take the initiative to stop others from polluting. Our India is finally breathing again after all these years, so let it breathe for longer now. And also maybe have better driving manners too!

3019,"How can I (and everyone else) help, in the war against coronavirus?Apologies for the pessimism and the wall of text, this is something I've been thinking - we all know that coronavirus is here. It's not a short term annoyance, it's a disaster of unimaginable proportions. People are going to die of coronavirus, jobs will be lost, people are going to die of starvation, the economy is going to get royally screwed, and so on. There's no getting away from that.

There is no vaccine right now, and most estimates I've seen predict that the vaccine development is a year away, if not more. And till a vaccine is developed, we are not going back to normalcy. Not even close it. And perhaps, not even after it.

So, here I am, locked in my room, working from home in a profession that does pretty much nothing to contribute to the coronavirus efforts (I am an algorithmic trader in the financial markets). I consider myself fairly well educated and intelligent, but I feel useless right now because I have to sit and wait while other people fight this war. And I'm sure there are many people in a similar situation as myself. So my question is, what can I (and we) do? 

Some things I thought of:
1. Obviously, I must do my part to stop the spread - viz, practice social distancing and taking precautions. I do that, religiously, and also ensure that my mother as well as others in immediate family follow all the guidelines.
2. Contribute to the welfare of underprivileged people. I have ensured that our maid, driver etc all will be paid salary even though they're not working right now. I have also told them to follow all the social distancing and taking precautions aspect, since they were taking it not very seriously (hope that has changed after Modi's announcement). However, I feel.i can do more, but I don't know how since I can not directly donate foodstuff and medicines, and I do not know which NGO/charity I can trust to do that effectively and efficiently (any suggestions here are welcome).
3. Spread awareness. I have tried to tell all the people I communicate with (all of whom seemed to be taking this much more lightly than I am), to be more and more cautious. I cannot enforce this on them like I might, say, on my mom. But I do what I can. Also, I have become active on my family WhatsApp groups for the first time in years - I am trying to call out dangerous misinformation which can cause people to become complacent. Also sharing latest, trustworthy updates.

What else? Is there anything else I can do here? I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot of things, but already this post is too long. Hope I haven't come across as self-indulgent or egoistic. Thanks",1585379563.0,,Coronavirus,dark,1,2

Also, honestly, all of us took a lot for granted, didn't we? We had normal lives. Going out for dinner, fancy food, smokes, Chai, hanging out with people, all of that.

Feels like we really took our normal lives for granted and now that feels like a luxury. Like personally if you ask me, if anyone ever makes plans again, I'm never saying no or canceling on them. I definitely am going to be grateful every single time I get to go out and hang out at the places I usually go to. I still have a regular supply of smoke and if I wanted, I could even get my greens. But it's not the same and it's not as fun as smoking at the tapri with a cutting Chai in hand. 

Also, I can't help but think about the regular faces I used to interact with on an almost daily basis while I didn't even know their names. You probably know people like that too. I really hope everyone makes it.

Most of the IT companies did start allowing Work from Home (wfh) for a majority of their employees. But some were left out from this under the pretext of essential work for banks such as Wells Fargo. They were forced to work from Office and only after much hue and cry and police raids did they allow the employees to take the desktops home as late as 24th March. This has opened a scope for the spread virus since the virus can still be transmitted amongst employees with out the employee showing any sign.

It has also come to notice that unofficially many employees were threatened of pay cut if they are unable to take the desktops home in spite of 24th Mar lockdown.


The pertinent question arises as to what happens when these employees and their families are found to be infected..? Will they have complete access to health care under company policy? But then, what about their family?

How will they manage their expense if there is mass lay-offs? Given that they are considered too rich to receive ration from govt and too poor to receive grants in the form of bail-outs.

Signs are not encouraging, given that top officials of [corporates](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2020-03-25/billionaires-want-people-back-to-work-workers-aren-t-so-sure) (including retired) are not providing encouraging statements (though overseas it will have rippling affect in India) & many companies [like this](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/coronavirus-impact-future-groups-kishore-biyani-in-a-difficult-situation-as-lenders-invoke-shares-report-5070601.html/amp) are already finding excuse of pre-existing loans which signals deferment  of salary pay, for many if not all.

Steps by RBI seems [encouraging](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/rbis-3-month-moratorium-on-term-loans-credit-card-dues-emis-included-interest-to-accrue-on-outstanding-portion-of-loan-5080581.html) but it still leaves a gaping hole in the pockets of the professionals.

#####Precautions for prevention of Corona Virus
^Currently ^there ^is ^no ^vaccine ^available ^to ^protect ^against ^human ^corona ^virus ^but ^we ^can ^reduce ^the ^transmission ^of ^virus ^by ^taking ^following ^precautions:

* Do
 * Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub
 * Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze
 * Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell
 * Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell
* Don't
 * Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean

#####How to Quarantine Yourself via [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html)
^If ^you‚Äôre ^returning ^from ^an ^area ^that‚Äôs ^had ^a ^coronavirus ^outbreak, ^or ^if ^you‚Äôve ^been ^in ^close ^contact ^with ^someone ^who ^tests ^positive, ^you ^may ^be ^asked ^to ^isolate ^yourself ^at ^home ^for ^two ^weeks, ^the ^presumed ^incubation ^period ^for ^the ^coronavirus.

^It‚Äôs ^not ^easy ^to ^lock ^yourself ^away ^from ^your ^family ^and ^friends. ^These ^are ^the ^basics.

1. **ISOLATION**: If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don‚Äôt have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it‚Äôs absolutely essential. Don‚Äôt take the bus, subway or even a taxi.

2. **MASKS**: If you must be around other people ‚Äî in your home, or in a car, because you‚Äôre on your way to see a doctor (and only after you‚Äôve called first) ‚Äî wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.

3. **HYGIENE**: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven‚Äôt just washed them.

4. **DISINFECTING**: Don‚Äôt share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.

5. **HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS**: When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you‚Äôre touching anything that might carry the patient‚Äôs bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.

3123,"Narendra Modi Likely To Declare A Emergency In India Under Article 360*It's a whatsapp forward. Wanted your opinion on this matter.*

Let us first understand, what is Article 360.

Article 360 in the constitution of India is for imposing a nationwide financial emergency in India.

Financial Emergency (Article 360):
Article 360 states that if the President is satisfied that a situation has arisen whereby the financial stability or the credit of India or any part thereof is threatened, the President may declare a state of financial emergency.
During the period such Proclamation is in operation, the executive authority of the Union extends to the giving of directions to any State to observe such canons of financial propriety as may be specified in the directions, any such directions may also include:
A provision required the reduction of salaries and allowances of all or any class of person serving a State or the Union.
A provision requiring all Money Bills or other Financial Bills to be reserved for the consideration of the President after they are passed by the legislature of the State.
A Proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
A proclamation issued under Article 360 will remain in force for two months unless before the expiry of the period it is approved by both the Houses of the Parliament.
Once approved it remains in force till revoked by the President.
No emergency under Article 360 has been issued so far.

India had been going through one of the worst phases of the financial crisis in its 72 years of history, India‚Äôs top 3 rating agencies like Fitch, Moody‚Äôs and S&P have already reduced India‚Äôs growth GDP to the lowest marks much before corona.

Now, this corona epidemic would have a long lasting & frightening effect on the Indian economy which might push India almost 70 years back similar to the partion era. Let‚Äôs connect the dots altogether.

1. The reserve bank of India has already made a war room with 90 people keeping an eye on the Indian economy which has never been done earlier in the entire history of the reserve bank.

2. Foreign investors pulled out 1.08 lakh crore rupees from Indian market in just 15 trading sessions

3. Almost 80% of the Indian companies are asking their employees to work from home, many companies including go air & air india have asked their staff to go on unpaid leaves, most companies have also terminated several employees.

4. Almost 80% of the major financial centers of the country are in lockdown including Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Lucknow, Kanpur, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Chennai, Kolkatta, Gurgaon, Noida, Ahemdabad, Surat.

5. US Dollor has the all time highest value against Indian currency, at the time of writing this article 1:53 AM midnight 23 march 2020, 1 USD was equal to 75.62.

6. Corona cases in India at the time of writing this article has reached 415.

7. Several sectors including hotels, restaurants, night clubs, bars, airlines, BPO, tourism, entertainment & Bollywood, auto-mobile, aviation, hospitality, apparel, consumer durables and electronics, Poultry and Seafood, construction, transport, railway are worst hit by this epidemic.

8. Several associated sectors also had a huge impact on their revenues like oil-petrol, security service industry and many others whose revenues are directly & indirectly dependent on the above sectors.

9. Coronavirus infection is spreading like fire and Indian agencies would not be able to control it in the near future, if by any chance, it enters into the fourth stage, which it is most likely to enter due to citizens ignorance, it would be the worst crisis in the entire history of Independent India.

10. Right now coronavirus is only among rich & elite who are able to handle the financial burdens & have multiple resources in terms of healthcare, work, financial savings and can still to self isolate & prevent it from spreading but Once it enters into people under Below Poverty Line, it would almost be impossible to control it and a large chunk of India‚Äôs revenue would be invested to handle the situation.

11. The reserve bank stored funds including the contingency funds & emergency funds have already depleted after RBI gave multiple chunks of large money to the current government.

12. Several Private & government banks in India have the highest NPA and loan defaulters doesn‚Äôt seem to be in any mood to be paying it off soon.

13. The share markets of India, including the National Stock Exchange (NSE) & Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) are continuously falling.

Connecting all the points from 1 to 13

One can easily understand that fighting coronavirus & controlling the economy of the country almost seems impossible for the current government.

We still hope for the best and wish all the luck to the government and its agencies to curb the situation.

If no steps would be of any help to control the economy, Narendra Modi would have no option but to impose the financial emergency in India under Article 360 and the country would go in its worst and most dreaded recession of all times.",1585325879.0,#ffb000,Policy/Economy,dark,14,8

My symptoms aren't really unusual  just an itchy  throat and malaise with a slight increase in body temp.  I'm in the process of talking to the health officials and getting tested  today. My parents have been constantly facing the taunts of the society  members of the apartment despite our complete seriousness and  compliance regarding this matter.

I am not sure if this post violates any guidelines or if there's a seperate thread going on regarding this..
But here is the thing; I am very sure you must have stumbled upon some news of how the poor and daily wage earners are hardly hit because of this lockdown. I think it's our responsibility to take care of these people during this hard phase that they are going through.
Here are some links to NGOs working to feed these hard hit poor during the lockdown. I am not sure if the help is actually reaching upto them or not but I guess it's not the right time to sit back and judge. If possible please donate to these campaigns-

3182,"India was late to react.Here's why I think India was late to react to COVID 19:

1Ô∏è‚É£COVID 19 entered India relatively late. China, US, EU, UAE & SEA had already been infected with it. 

2Ô∏è‚É£Hence, we can't claim that we reacted promptly. Had India been infected in January/ February, we would not have taken it seriously just like the above countries.

3Ô∏è‚É£ India should have not allowed NRIs from the infected countries in February.

4Ô∏è‚É£Also there was no strict checking at the airports for tourists and NRIs and no compulsary quarantine for them.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Home Quarantine stamp was a poorly executed and a soft measure. These guys should have been quarantined in hospitals.

6Ô∏è‚É£ India should not have evacuated people from infected countries. This was purely a decision based on emotions. Not good.

7Ô∏è‚É£ Indians should not have played Holi this year. This was tweeted by the prime minister. But nobody took it seriously.

8Ô∏è‚É£ Government should have deported the 16 Italian tourists who were infected. This was reported on 4th March.

9Ô∏è‚É£ Government started with sanitization, curfews and lockdowns only after WHO declared COVID 19 as a pandemic.

1Ô∏è‚É£0Ô∏è‚É£ Airports should have been sealed much earlier. Probably in mid February.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial cases in India were reported in Kerala. These were people who had travelled from Wuhan, China. It was really stupid of India to bring people from the most infected place on the earth in India.

Nevertheless, government & health officials are trying their best to get rid of this by 14th April. Let's hope for the best.",1585337460.0,,Coronavirus,dark,20,40

The thing is I'm pregnant and due to the lockdown I didn't visit my regular clinic for sonography. At The current clinic, the doctor is using my father's name in the form instead of husband's because apparently in Maharashtra different surnames for husband and wife leads to problems during form verification.

3286,"How do you guys deal with this situation emotionally?I'm not that great at expressing my mental state, but this is the best I've got. I don't think I've been this depressed ever. It's not because I've been asked to sit at home, but because I've come face to face with the kind of world we live in.

So many people around the world are suffering due to negligence and ignorance of a few powerful people (maybe in some cases the people are responsible for their own suffering, but thats not the point). I can't even imagine what the people (patients, medical staff, families) in the most affected regions are going through and I don't even want to.


Even here at home, so many poor people are affected due to the lockdown - hungry, tired and helpless. I know a lockdown was absolutely necessary, but was this the best way we could have gone about it? And the police beating up people just because then can?  Most of us are comfortable in out homes, going on with our lives in the best way we can. But every time I look at any sort of news, I go back to wondering if the poor people are doomed forever for a life like this? What are those Swiggy/Zomato delivery guys, the Uber/Ola/Auto drivers, the office security and food vendors and so many others who provided me a short but important service going through now? I can't even step out to see if I can help anyone because I fear getting beaten up. And I don't even want to talk about those guys trying to use this crisis as a way to make some money (including my Apartment Association - like WTH guys?). It's like for every reason to be grateful for, there are 2 reasons that make you feel sad.


Am I just overthinking this? Are we just supposed to accept that the world is bad, the people will suffer no matter what and continue on with our lives? How do I make peace with whatever is happening everywhere, especially when you can't get distracted by your usual day-to-day stuff?",1585370155.0,,Coronavirus,dark,3,4

3321,"My cousin is a sexual abuser. Do I confront him?Should I forgive my sexual abuser? TW: Sexual abuse/assault

Hi reddit.

For context, I am 20F and my cousin is 28M now. I was 15/16 when this happened and he was 24. I live in the states, but my family is really indian (culturally) so I thought I would get the best opinion here. 

I've made a post about my sexual abuse story: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sex/comments/dlq0s1/was_i_molested_by_my_cousin_i_dont_know_if_i_am/). I would suggest at least skimming over it but it is not necessary. Long story short, when I was 16, my cousin snuck in the room several times at times and touched me inappropriately (boobs (fondling and pinching my nipples) and my hip (I think he tried to touch my ""area"" but  I started getting more aggressive and he stopped, but he might have when I was sleeping). For those of you asking why I didn't stop him after the first time, I was scared of not being believed but I did tell him to stop several times and he wouldn't. Anyway. Recently I have been doing a lot of emotionally processing and healing, and this trauma is at the root of most of my mental health issues. I was extremely angry and resentful towards him for 4 years (rightfully so) but it took a huge toll on my mental health and didn't allow me to heal from this. I'm conflicted because he is not a ""bad"" person. Yes, he did a monstrous thing but he is not a monster and that is making this so confusing and even more difficult. Our family is very close so I've been around him A LOT these past few years, and we've had a lot of great moments together and I *almost* forgot what happened for a split second every time. I want to forgive him, especially for myself, but I don't know how to do that. Personally, I know that I need to have a conversation with him about this but I don't know how to bring this up. I don't even know if he remembers or if he will admit to it, but I think I'm prepared for both of those outcomes. My question is, is he worthy of forgiveness? I know it's a healing process for me, but does he deserve to know that I have forgiven him? Also, how would you go about this situation? Any and all advice is appreciated!

Kerala's genuinely well planned measures & steps are being undermined by the photos of Malayalis *still* queueing up at state sanctioned, social distance practicing, liquor shops. (i may be teetotaller who can't relate to the same, but it's theoretically the same as buying vegetables) The ""Doobaii Gellf"" stink of racism & Communism bashing in the messages is inescapable. 

Ajay Bisht's trips to temples for prayers HOURS after the PM's speech are not nearly being highlighted & circulated enough. The messages should start off with your garden variety WhatsApp forward language but it needs to starkly point out the contradiction of actions vs words. 

There are still educated folks, senior management members belong to high profile organisations (with actual power to direct their company policies), our parents & elders who are still insisting on the harmless nature of WhatsApp forwards & their (usually subtle but not any longer) propaganda. Uncles gloriously sharing insane conspiracy theories about Chinese biological warfare & economic Trojan wars ***sent from their iPhones***


And if it comes to it, the best / worst ploy I think of:


""All Chinese manufactured mobile phones have steps to  capture your data & share it with Chinese Government who can track & infect you with Corona"" 

Whatever makes them stay the fuck away from their phones, the better. Diabolical maybe, but it will only help in underlying the false hyperbole of the messages that they send.

Ideally having an honest conversation in person, on the phone & calling out such deep seated biases & obvious plot holes in the sham theories should suffice - but sadly it still falls short.

And this needs to be done in multiple languages as well - Hindi, Marathi, Telegu, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam et all.

There is a whole new wave of messages bashing UK, US, China yet to arrive.

With ""Ramayan"" being broadcast again - you can only assume the levels of Hindutva propaganda that's being readied by the IT Cell.

Not to mention, with more positive cases of Corona Virus infections surfacing in the past 2 day - new fluff pieces will be deployed to divert attention away.

While our medical community & Healthcare staff members wage war in hospitals and clinics - we self anointed keyboard warriors too need to step up and contribute in a small way to ensure we fundamentally improve & eliminate this rabid Fake News infection by the end of the lock down, in 3 weeks time.",1585331796.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,7,24

More than 1 lakh people are stranded at the UP Delhi border. Who the fuck will look after them if they contract the disease? Who the fuck will care about them? 

These people are at many times the only breadwinners of the family. Can we be so ignorant, that we readily allow entire families of poor to get destroyed? Some  owners of factories, contractors have simply haven't paid these workers and simply turned a blind eye towards these people. 

People like you and me have plenty of surplus money and resources. There are people who literally completely depend on their next month's salary to run their houses. How do you think would they manage?

Government just abruptly closed down the entire nation. What arrangement did it make so that the poor reach their homes along with their familes safely? It is not as simple as booking a cab or renting a car for them. People are literally walking miles and miles to reach home. Why aren't these people being given masks, being scanned or being disinfected? People are being brutally tortured by the police. Don't they deserve spending this dark and difficult time with their familes, in their homes?
Try to imagine the immense fear and desperation and the helplessness of these people.

Everybody is praising the Indian government on how efficiently they brought an early lockdown. They don't realize what the poor are going through, simply because the society doesn't care about them.

Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren‚Äôt that many but they‚Äôre increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn‚Äôt. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‚Äòflu clinic‚Äô and don‚Äôt even see the face of the screening centre. I don‚Äôt know whether the government can‚Äôt afford the testing kits or it doesn‚Äôt want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won‚Äôt test them. They‚Äôre frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor.

Lakhs of migrant labourers have been left stranded. They have no way to get back to their villages. They can't stay back. They have no money to feed themselves. They have no option but to head back home by foot as they can at least manage to get some food back in their native place.

This mass exodus of migrant workers is what happens when a government is myopic to the point of blindness. A proper plan could and would have prevented this. A proper stimulus package planned in advance, and not one quickly put together in reaction to this, should have been there. This mass exodus has many, many, many problems surrounding it. For one, can you imagine people turning into nomads overnight when food and water that's usually available everywhere is missing thanks to a lockdown? Can you imagine, how these men, women, and children are supposed to *walk* hundreds of kilometers in absence of public transport? It's beyond cruel what the Centre has compelled these already oppressed groups of people to do right now. These migrant workers will also (many already are) face the brutality of lathi-happy cops. With state borders locked, they will essentially remain nomads, unless proper arrangements are made for them.  And, worst of all, these migrant workers, who don't have the luxury to wash hands for twenty seconds with soaps (can't afford soaps, can't afford to waste what little water they have), how are they supposed to remain safe from the pandemic? It's also equally likely that they make take the coronavirus along with them to their villages. And let's not forget that rural public healthcare is already in shambles. Those rushing to fellate the prime minister for his ""brave"" and ""strong"" step do not fucking understand how this lockdown has already disrupted the lives of hundreds of thousands of people.

Now due to quantity of virus being insufficient it could not multiply as much. And then body ""**identified**"" it as external threat. And antibodies killed it fast because virus ""**army**"" was still too small!

Now can this act as a ""natural"" vaccine for future Corona attacks?

Because now body knows about Corona virus just on the same principle as vaccine works.

Can I become immune to Corona without even knowing that it infected me to small level?

PS: Just a curious question. I have no idea if body or corona works that way.",1585312648.0,,Coronavirus,dark,7,15

A 21 year-old student was robbed at gunpoint by two men on a bike. He was trying to document scenes of the lockdown near his house. 

This may sound like it's too obvious to be said out loud but let's all be careful carrying cash and valuables, jewelry and cellphones, outside the house, while going grocery shopping, especially if you need to go through any now-deserted stretches.

I've seen many people, including my father who would prefer to walk to the nearby market, but, if possible, it seems safer to take vehicles even for what might seem like a very short distance, and then park as close as possible to the shop. 

This concern extends to shopkeepers dealing in  cash as well but besides shutting shop, I can't think of many ways they can reasonably mitigate the risks.",1585310730.0,,Coronavirus,dark,4,32

3454,"Theory of our democratic problemHello r/india. I'm 16 and i live in Sri lanka, and i have noticed something here that has made me think deeper about our situation. 
There are 2 parties in lanka. One seeks votes from Buddhist people and other from minority relegions. The dominant party, Buddhist one, gets 70% votes, and there is exactly 70% Buddhists in Lanka. All other relegions support opposition party, which gets the remaining 30% votes. People here don't hide it. Even tho the parties are similar to ours, they openly say they vote it because they support the relegion they want them to.

This has made me wonder. This is purely my opinion, but In developing countries, people are v conservative and are easy to manipulate on the basis of relegion. While it is present in progressive countries like UK, USA, it is to a much smaller extent. Relegious provocation is in all democratic developing countries. Thats why propogranda compares us to Pakistan, which is a Muslim state, so that it can provoke emotions in people and make them proud for hindu and vote for bjp. I looked around some other democarcies who are in development stage, to find more or less the same result.

The only way to tackle relegious propogranda is for us to become progressive. Gay marriage should be common and accepted, we should be civilised and civil,women should be respected much more and allowed to wear whatever the fuck they want without people even batting an eye so that we can truly feel proud as Indians and not as Hindus and Muslims. This divide is by politicians to suck vote out of people. They're just relegions. Yogi is especially guilty of this. Only if we're progressive will this happen.

I used to think when our gen (GenZ/millenials) takes over, things will change. But it won't. Our gen is brainwashed by their own parents. We're trapped in this relegious brainwashed cycle and blindly follow parents. Even that needs to change. Tho, on the positive side, my current generation has been spawning more and more independent thinkers. That's the good side. I have soo many friends who blindly support modi just because their parents do. Their parents feed them this propoganda so much that one of my friends was even ready to go as far as to, and i quote, ""kill muslims so that our holy cow is protected"".

Hopefully things change and people open their eyes. I've also learned that as dangerous andh bhakts are, andh virodhis are no better. We need to be sane and keep our eyes open and criticise the wrongdoings no matter what, and appreciate the good things. Relegion has become an inevitable part of politics, thanks to bjp, and a progressive developing mindset is one of the best way to tackle this.

1. Since most of my friends are restaurant owners, I want to go meet EVERYONE. I want to hug everyone I've known in the outside world and if I meet people I've had a falling out with, I'll hug them too. Our problems are nothing. I really hope everyone makes it.
2. Things I've taken for granted and really want to eat again.   
a)CHOCOLATE FUCKING CAKE. I'M BUYING ATLEAST A KILO AND THE MESSAGE IS GONNA BE MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS.   
b) Mithai!!! If I knew things would escalate so quickly, I really would have stocked up. The only stock I have right now is of smokes and chocolates.   
c) Samosa, and although Vada Pav makes me sick, I'm gonna eat that anyway. I miss it.  
d) Pizza, burgers, fries, even coca cola(I'm anti anything by that company but now I'm desperate for some junk food) you name it.  
e) Icecream!  
f) Shawarma. oh my god I miss this terribly. 
3. Things I want to drink- I don't really drink but when I do, I'm a spiced rum and coke person (thank you Cambodia) BUT that being said, I definitely am going to buy myself some beer.
4. Things I want to do- Go trekking! I believe nature will be so amazing this time with barely any pollution. 
5. I also really want to go out on a long ride on my bike. Right now my bike trips are limited to buying smokes (which ends in 5 mins) and I definitely need to go out more.
6. Go for long walks, road trips, picnics, you name it. I'm not a ""religious institution"" person, but I'll do that too.
7. Go watch any movie in a theater.
8. Ride a local train. I miss the crowds.
9. Probably you. (Sorry just thought this was funny)

No jokes, I think the list could be longer but this sums up the main things I really wanna do. If any of you around would like to join me for any or all of these things, feel free to send me a message! We'll talk and keep in touch and whenever the chaos ends and the sun's shine is truly warm, a one that brings happiness, we'll hang out.

Lots of love and peace to you and be safe wherever you are and stay home as much as possible.",1585313000.0,#b8001f,Food,light,21,11

There should not be any harrasment from the police when the public needs their support.I don't know if there is a system in place to screen people who apply for the job, if it's there it needs to improve if not then put in place. This just shows the mental health of these people. They are no more than gundas in the uniform and we do not need those people. 

I want these people be kicked out of the force because of them people are worried /scared more then they need to be.

3554,"Indian Parents: Level of legal controlI grew up in the US under a patriarchal, abusive father. He hit my mother until she called the police. Then he started throwing things to cause distress while evading the law (mom wouldn't call the cops on that, just physical abuse). He did the same to me, opened our mail, forged our signatures on documents where convenient, and was just a miserable person in general. 

Even in the Indian American community most people despise him for various reasons, so I know this is not normal.

I no longer speak to him. He tried to force the IRS and DMV  (in the US) to hand over my information but was refused.

I have wondered what life would have been like if he didn't move to the US.  2 questions regarding this:

1. I know in India this behavior is still not normal. My question is, what percentage of Indian men become deeply abusive like this? I have suspected he grew up under equally damaging conditions. My grandpa passed away when I was 5 or 6 so I could never tell. 
2. If I ceased contact with him, except in India, does the father have special powers to get information for adult children? Perhaps by lying to authorities in some way (""My son needs supervision due to illness)? Years later he is still trying using various schemes, most of which are illegal to uncover where I've moved (I've considered reporting him to put a halt to it).

If you guys are interested, will update this post with more. 

Mods, there are few India specific apps like HealthifyMe, QTalk. I hope this post is relevant and harmless. Also, can make this a mega thread if people are interested in contibuting. 

**Physical & Mental Health** This is the most crucial factor. Eat healthy, keep your immunity up, and workout a bit.

* [HealthifyMe](http://healthifyme.com/) \- During this period you can keep a check on your diet plan, boost immunity. They have live workout sessions on the app as well. 
* [Wysa](https://www.wysa.io/) \- AI-based ‚Äòemotionally intelligent‚Äô bot, a virtual coach which uses evidence-based cognitive-behavioural techniques (CBT), DBT, meditation, breathing, yoga and a whole lot more.
* [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com/) \- Staying in is not everyone's cup of tea. To relax, try guided meditation. This will help you stay motivated and mindful.

**Recipes**

If you've been paranoid about ordering food from Swiggy, Zomato like me and have been considering cooking, may I suggest:

* [Recipe Book](https://recipebook.io/) \- As the name suggests, a ton of recipes! Easy to follow and a pretty well-done app.

**Communication**

This is a good time to keep in touch with friends and family. Don't forget to drop in a call to check-in and see how they're doing - or if you just want to gossip. Not mentioning WhatsApp, Duo as many are aware of it.

* [QTalk](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qtalk.app) \- If you have been calling your friends and get bored beyond a point, you can use QTalk to do regular phone calls + cobrowse videos, play games with your callers, browse websites with them directly from a call.
* [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) \- Lets you chat in larger groups. A lot of Redditors already know about it. Sharing it since a lot of my friends were unaware.

**Learn to play an instrument**  
Now is also a good time to finally pick up that instrument and learn how to play it if you have one. 

* [Fender Play](https://www.fender.com/play) \- Fender Play has a two week trial for guitar, bass and ukulele. There is a step-by-step guide for beginners, right from chords to strumming and understanding scales.

Will be adding more categories if we see enough upvotes here. Have an app you'd like to suggest? Please comment and share :)",1585290985.0,,Coronavirus,dark,3,6

I came across this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fpoww3/with_all_the_police_brutality_at_show_during_the/) and a few of them are quite distrubing. If a cop hits someone he must file a detailed report and should talk to police department's HR/therapist about why they felt such force was required. There are many efficient/effective ways to discipline people who disregard the public safety. Hitting all the people with the same baton is not the answer. I don't even think police departments have something like this in place and it is likely most of these cops are not in the right state of mind or even educated enough to judge the level of action required.

3683,"Feeling suicidal: Narcissistic mother and my mental breakdown in these times of lockdownThis lockdown is a hell for me. My mother is very narcissistic in nature and my dad the very opposite. I am 24. I belong to a lower middle class family, my dad runs a paan shop and my mom works as a cook in different homes.

She always mistreats my dad due to his low income and his submissive nature. She is short tempered. She used to yell at me and my sister for not being extroverts and used to say things like ''why was I cursed with such kids'', ''I am the smartest in the whole extended family'', etc. She always saw me as a window to a good lifestyle once I start earning well in the future. 

My mother used to  bash me for not losing weight but when I finally lost weight she bashed me again for losing too much of weight and criticized my diet habits. As a kid, I was always verbally abused for smallest of the mistakes. Gradually, I developed a horrible personality wherein I didn't wanted to hurt people even by the slightest of my actions. I realised this only few years back. I still can't smile properly.

As I grew up things somehow felt better, she used to be angry less frequently atleast towards us kids. But I started losing the track on my studies. I went into depression, not studying, failing my professional exams, addicted to phone, etc. Once she got to know about this she cried and was empathetic for me. Obviously she isn't at all an evil person but her narcissistic side has done more harm than her good side. 

There was never an emotional connect in my family. I hide my emotions, never to be on my own while with my family. Once I even shifted to another city finding a job to live on my own, but this bloody depression made me abandon my job and again I came back to my family. Took a job again, but entry level jobs always felt a drag, so I left it to study for another professional exam. 

Now at this point, I knew it was risky to quit and live at home on my parents money. Yet I continued thinking my parents will support me. Things were going fine until this lockdown. My exams were postponed, my dad went to village, expenses now depending on our savings.

Today I was not in a great mood and made a small mistake of refusing to bring some snack items from the shop, my sister too refused as she was studying. And it was a tipping point, she got angry and started her harsh verbal bashing saying ""people are earning truckloads of money outside and you people are sitting at home eating on my money while throwing tantrums. You people have achieved so much by studying that you are still sitting at home. You don't deserve me"" ,etc etc. She was continuously abusing and I lost my control and cried. 

I felt suicidal, I am losing hopes of living a good life. I am highly myopic in one eye with -9.0 and -2.0 and at times I feel like my eyes are giving up. The only hope I have is to migrate again and this time I have a strong will to live independently but thinking about surviving this lockdown for so many days ahead is making me claustrophobic.",1585291814.0,#5093d6,Non-Political,dark,10,41

3708,"Delhi Police admits to using drones on civilians without any publicly available legal guidelines in place&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/2bek5rixn5p41.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=1ca65e50744218eb0cb5f97c4f4813e00518bd35

**Tl;dr**

With reports now emerging that the Delhi Police is using drones to check for people who are breaking the curfew in Delhi, we examine responses we have received in reply to Right to Information requests filed about the usage of drones in Delhi in February. The Delhi Police admits to hiring drones for various purposes over the course of the last few months including the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly elections and during the riots in North-East Delhi. This is being done with no guidelines in place for their use and thus are not only a violation of the right to privacy of individuals but also a tool of mass surveillance in the hands of the government.  


**Wait‚Ä¶ What?**

The Delhi Police has been using drones for surveillance of crowds for quite some time now. The first [**reports**](https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/anti-caa-stir-delhi-police-use-drone-to-keep-track-of-protesters-1629729-2019-12-19) emerged in December, 2019 when it was reported that anti-CAA protests had been surveilled via drones to keep a close eye on the protesters. This was in addition to the Delhi Police‚Äôs use of [**Fa**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/)[**cial Recognition Technology**](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/police-film-protests-run-its-images-through-face-recognition-software-to-screen-crowd-6188246/) to identify the protesters (read our previous blog post where we sent a notice to the Delhi Police to cease such use [**here**](https://internetfreedom.in/we-demand-the-delhi-police-stop-its-facial-recognition-system/)).  


Subsequently, there were [**reports**](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/from-facial-recognition-system-to-four-layer-security-delhi-police-gears-up-for-r-day-11579892354659.html) that the Delhi Police used drones on crowds during the Republic Day parade in January, 2020 to ‚Äúmaintain vigil‚Äù. In February, 2020 there were [**reports**](https://thewire.in/government/delhi-riots-police-special-commissioner) that the Delhi Police had used drones to ‚Äúmonitor the situation‚Äù during the riots in North-East Delhi.   


Now [**reports**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/5146-held-in-delhi-for-defying-lockdown-1018-vehicles-seized/articleshow/74801660.cms) are emerging that the Delhi Police is using [**drones**](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/covid-19-drones-used-to-enforce-lockdown-more-booked-for-violating-prohibitory-orders/articleshow/74831906.cms) to ensure that people do not violate the 21-day curfew imposed by the Government in a bid to combat the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   


**The Delhi Police confirms using drones**

On February 14, 2020, we filed a Right to Information request with the Delhi Police asking the following questions:

1. Whether the Delhi Police has procured drones for any purpose?

2. Details of the tender issued for such procurement.

3. Information about the vendor from whom the drones were procured and the total expenditure incurred.

4. Information with regard to the technical specifications of the drones.

5. Whether these drones were deployed in December, 2019 and January, 2020?

6. Any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures in place which govern the use of these drones by the Delhi Police.  


Our request was transferred to various departments of the Delhi Police. We received replies from multiple departments denying any use of drones by them. However, in a reply dated March 13, 2020, the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the North-East District, Seelampur, Delhi Police confirmed that they have been using drones. ¬†  


**Here is a point-wise summary of their reply:**

1. The North-East District has **hired** drones for maintaining law and order.

2. Since the drones have been hired, there was no tender which was issued for procurement.

3. The Delhi Police has been hiring drones from the open market through Station House Officers (SHO).

4. The technical specifications of these hired drones are not available with the PIO.

5. The PIO confirmed that drones were used during the 2020 Delhi Legislative Assembly election which were held on February 8, 2020 and during the riots in North-East Delhi which began on February 23, 2020.

6. In response to the query asking whether there are any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedure governing the use of drones by the Delhi Police, the reply was ‚Äúno comment‚Äù.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c5pa6iaun5p41.jpg?width=1189&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d720d93cab9d35f9eabcfc151292e56b58c12e8

**Why does this matter anyway?**

There are multiple problems in the way that drones are being used in Delhi.

1. Hiring drones instead of procuring through a publicly available tender diminishes the transparency of the whole exercise. As a result of not releasing a tender, we now have no information with regard to from whom these tenders are being hired, how much expenditure has been incurred and what is the scope of their use.

2. Since there are no publicly available guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures with regard to the use of drones, this whole process is shrouded in opacity. There is no information as to how these drones are being used, who is authorized to use them, who has access to the information gathered and how this information is being processed. ¬†  


**So what now?**

IFF has consistently been against use of such invasive technology especially in a [**legal vacuum**](https://internetfreedom.in/problems-with-facial-recognition-systems-operating-in-a-legal-vacuum/). The only [**regulations**](https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=183093) for drones in India are those which subsist for commercial purposes and which have been developed by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). Drones are being used in Delhi without any guidelines, rules or standard operating procedures which have been made publicly available. It is our opinion that use of such technology can never be justified if not done in a transparent manner. We urge the Delhi Police to make any such guidelines, if they exist, publicly available. If not, we urge the Delhi Police to immediately cease such use. This is because even in extraordinary times such as these, we have to ensure that basic fundamental rights, such as privacy, are not the scapegoats which have to be sacrificed for the purported greater good.

3745,"An amateur take on the 1.7 Lakh Crore relief announced by the Government (Could be inaccurate)So here's the lowdown of the package which has been announced by Finance Min. Please note it is an amateurish take on the economics. If you see mistakes/half truths, please do educate me.

* **Insurance cover of Rs 50 Lakh per health worker fighting COVID-19 to be provided under Insurance Scheme**

Excellent move. Theses are the people who are fighting on the front lines. Is the state paying the insurance premium? Or is this just to inflate the total amount of relief package.

* **80 crore poor people will to get 5 kg wheat or rice and 1 kg of preferred pulses for free every month for the next three months**

Excellent move. Food security is an issue. But those without ration cards, including migrant workers could be affected. The government had earlier tried to bring in ""One nation One Ration Card"". This scheme would have tremendously helped. And also free LPG. Good move imo.

* **20 crore women Jan Dhan account holders to get Rs 500 per month for next three months**

Good move. Though amount could have been higher and it could've covered more groups of people. i.e make it more inclusive.

* **Increase in MNREGA wage to Rs 202 a day from Rs 182 to benefit 13.62 crore families**

Who is working during a lockdown? Is it payable on arrears?

* **An ex-gratia of Rs 1,000 to 3 crore poor senior citizen, poor widows and poor disabled**

Peanuts for the individual familes.

* **Government to front-load Rs 2,000 paid to farmers in first week of April under existing PM Kisan Yojana to benefit 8.7 crore farmers**

Existing scheme has been repackaged to seem like a relief effort. Could have at least released more money.

* **Central Government has given orders to State Governments to use Building and Construction Workers Welfare Fund to provide relief to Construction Workers**

No expenditure from the Central Government per se.

**This amount is 0.75% of our GDP.  (**[The Hindu Article](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/coronavirus-outbreak-mixed-response-to-centres-relief-package/article31176475.ece)**)**

A welcome first step, but too less. Unorganized sector is the most affected of the lot and they are not covered anywhere, except if we consider the food security aspect. Hopefully they would bring in more schemes in the near future.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit

* Centre is paying **24 percent of their monthly wages into their PF accounts for next three months**. (for organized workers)
* Employees‚Äô Provident Fund Regulations will be amended to include Pandemic as the reason to **allow non-refundable advance of 75 percent of the amount or three months of the wages, whichever is lower, from their accounts**.  (For organized workers)

So basically, paying into PF accounts would generally mean you can't take it out in normal situation. But since they have added the Pandemic as a reason, it makes withdrawing money pretty easy. Good move.

* Limit of collateral free lending would be increased from Rs 10 to Rs 20 lakhs for women led SHG.

Interesting idea. Again the centre isn't paying any money per se.

* **The State Government will be asked to utilise the funds available under District Mineral Fund (DMF) for supplementing and augmenting facilities of medical testing, screening and other requirements in connection with preventing the spread of COVID-19 pandemic as well as treating the patients affected with this pandemic.**

very much required. Testing is of paramount importance at this moment. But again, this money is parked with individual states. Centre has little to no role.",1585284193.0,,Coronavirus,dark,10,11

Here are my few tips on what you **MUST** buy on a grocery run:

Oil, Rice, Atta, Salt & Sugar, Milk, Eggs, Tea, Coffee, Pickles, Potatoes, Onions, Frozen Peas, canned tomato, Maggi, Jams, Biscuits.

(Get dehydrated milk as a backup otherwise try to get Tetra packs ‚Äì much better shelf life.)

**Good To get:**

Fresh veggies (freeze them if needed), garlic, Fruits, sooji, Ready to eat packs (gets expensive though), yoghurt, Juices, Chips, all other things you like.

How you can make items last longer, be more filling:

\- Make maggi more filling by making it into a noodle soup bowl with whatever veggies or eggs if you have on hand. Just add a little extra salt to balance out the water or red chilli if you like it spicy.

\- Make rice more filling and last a little longer also by making it soupy by adding any veggies, any dal you have. Keep it the consistency that you have to use a bowl to eat.

\- If you have leftover dal at home and are sick of eating it, make some dough with it. Make dal rotis.

\- If you have veggies and want them to last longer, blanch and freeze them. 

Look for recipes online, there are lot of easy to follow videos too.

The app will track user's location and alert if they are at risk of being exposed.

Some reviews say data of all positive and quarantined persons will be entered into the database and app will be used to monitor them, if they break quarantine police will be informed. Not sure how true that is.

If it's indeed true, is it legal, is there any precedent of any other countries using this approach.

Edit: Found a recent article by Yuval Noah Harari on the very same subject. 

> In their battle against the coronavirus epidemic several governments have already deployed the new surveillance tools. The most notable case is China. By closely monitoring people‚Äôs smartphones, making use of hundreds of millions of face-recognising cameras, and obliging people to check and report their body temperature and medical condition, the Chinese authorities can not only quickly identify suspected coronavirus carriers, but also track their movements and identify anyone they came into contact with. A range of mobile apps warn citizens about their proximity to infected patients.

> Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel recently authorised the Israel Security Agency to deploy surveillance technology normally reserved for battling terrorists to track coronavirus patients. When the relevant parliamentary subcommittee refused to authorise the measure, Netanyahu rammed it through with an ‚Äúemergency decree‚Äù.

3801,"Spread this message !!! --> It is un-Islamic to pray Friday prayers in Congregation in such times.It has been observed that there are some people regardless of faith trying to form groups or not take this lock down seriously. Some Muslims are aware of praying in homes their daily 5 prayers but would like to make some efforts to at least pray Friday prayers at noon in group or congregation.

Here are the scholarly answers and clarifications for those who are not aware of Islamic position on such situations.

The Islamic position in this issue is not praying in congregation.

Scholarly opinion :

*If a specialized body determines that medical quarantine or isolation is to be imposed on someone, it is obligatory for him to comply with that, and to not attend Friday prayers or prayers in congregation. Therefore he should offer the prayers at home or in the place where he is quarantined.  This is because of the report narrated by as-Shareed ibn Suwayd ath-Thaqafi, who said, ""Among the delegation from Thaqeef there was a man with leprosy. The Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) sent word to him, saying, 'We have accepted your oath of allegiance, so go back.'"" \[Narrated by Muslim}*

Source :  The Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 

Therefore, Complying with the government in this case if mandatory for Muslims. Islam wants to bring you ease and not difficulty.

Quarantine :

If people are told to quarantine themselves and not go out during a lock down, this is in fact an Islamic practice.

&#x200B;

Scholarly opinion :

 It is prohibited for a person infected with this virus to attend Friday prayers and prayers in congregation, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, ‚ÄúSick (camels) should not be put with healthy (camels)."" \[Narrated by al-Bukhaari and Muslim\], and because he (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, ""If you hear of the outbreak of a plague in a land, do not enter it; and if it breaks out in a land in which you are, do not leave it."" \[al-Bukhaari and Muslim\].

Also,

It is not permissible to attend any prayers in congregation which could cause harm to one's own self or others. 

Scholarly opinion :

If anyone fears that he may be harmed or may harm others, it is permissible for him to not attend the Friday prayer and prayers in congregation, because the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said, ""There should be neither harm nor reciprocating harm."" \[Narrated by Ibn Majah\].

Lastly,

What is the alternative to Friday Prayers in congregation ?

The alternative is to Pray Friday Prayers like usually  Dhuhr  (noon prayers) with 4 rakats. i.e. 4 cycles of standing , bowing, and prostration.

&#x200B;

Please share this information with whoever you think has an opinion that it is unislamic to pray in Congregation on Friday.

Tell them it is actually Islamic to follow the experts and the government agencies and not gather in groups or pray in congregation to restrict the spread of this COVID-19 Pandemic.

There were no instructions to self isolate from the authorities, not that I went out after coming home anyway. 

Since then it has been three weeks, and I haven't had any symptoms whatsoever. I got a call from ICMR a couple of days ago asking about my health. And today I got a message to download an app and update my symptoms.

The thing is, the officials never said anything about an app on the call, and my phone is telling me not to download an unsafe .apk. I looked it up and the app isn't even on the play store or app store. 

Should I download it and risk it? Do you think it's a scam? Also, why are they contacting me now after the incubation period inspite of me showing no symptoms.",1585247945.0,,Coronavirus,dark,2,0

Since the beginning of March, I've been getting terribly low speeds on the same plan.

Now I had it enough with the slow speed and called up the customer service because I couldn't do any video conferencing or upload assignments.  They said they were helpless and couldn't do anything and I should wait for a day or two to see if the speed improves. 

Now I've waited 3 days and speed is still the same (17 Mbps downloading speed on speedtest) and I called up the customer care rep today after upgrading my plan to 250mbps ( 2 days back ), this was his response :

1) He said that if I'm getting speeds above 20mbps it's healthy (gosh I'm so lucky).

2) Can't transfer me to any senior executive.

3) Can't direct anyone to come at my home.

I've tried all the bullshit troubleshoot options which I already did myself before calling them.

Also I have the full call in recording, any suggestions or tips might be helpful.

3930,"Is this practically possible? Can anyone come up with a calculation on how much can we collect?Amid the Covid-19 crisis, our FM presented a relief package of 1.7 Lakh Crores. I had a thought if someone would agree with me.

***Let's assume there is no corruption in this scenario, the fund be well utilized and every money given will reach the masses.***

* Create a fund dedicated to deal with this pandemic.
* The President, PM, MPs and MLAs and MLCs donate **6 months** of their salary to this fund. They are well to do and can survive if they don't take salaries for 6 months.

The collected money would be approximately as follows: (Assuming 1 Lakh each)

&#x200B;

    MPs (543+245) = 7 Crore 88 L	
    MLAs 4116+ MLCs 426 = 45 Crore 42 L
    
    Total salary 53 Crores 40 L 60 Thousand
    Approximate total Collection *320 Crores* 
            

* Then we have CJI and Supreme and High Court judges, CEC, CAG, UPSC Chairman, Governors of States and Lt. Gov. of UTs. They can contribute **3 months** salary as well. This can add up as well.
* The IAS, Principal Secretaries and Additional Secretaries to the Central and State Govt.  respectively. They can contribute **2 months** of their salary. With about 5000 IAS across India assuming 1 L each salary can contribute up to *100 Crores.*
* Then the State Level administrators like SDM, Tehsildars etc can donate **1 month** of their salary. Other Gazetted officers can do this too.
* Then we have class II, Class III who can donate **half a month** of their salary.
* The list can be extended to well to do corporate CEOs and other officers in private sector.
* Corporate sector pool in money including influential people from film industry, Sports persons etc.
* Religious sects can do their part. And many more organizations as well.
* I did not add Security and other police forces and doctors as they are already doing enough for us.

3979,"I have proposed a strategy on how [coronavirus] can be tackled by the Indian and state government using Divide and Conquer by isolating and bordering small cities until virus has been removed. I'm very confident in this strategy and i request you to share it with appropriate authoritiesRespected Authorities,

Here, is the strategy that i propose.

Since the country is on 21 days lock down there will be many small cities which are still unaffected and Since traveling is prohibited these unaffected area‚Äôs will remain unaffected (Hopefully).

Right now every small cities and states are isolated because of lock down. I propose a **Divide And Conquer Type strategy.**

**Let‚Äôs say for example** Thane city in Mumbai is unaffected. After 21 days of Lock ‚Äì down, we will know based on rigorous testing focused only on thane citizen whether or not corona virus exists within thane city. Hopefully let‚Äôs assume that none of the citizens of thane has been affected by corona virus. Our next step begins after day 21 of lock-down. That is, **Day 22**

When we have strong confidence that citizen‚Äôs of thane are unaffected of corona virus, we can remove the lock-down from only Thane city. Here, it is important to be as divisible as possible. Since it is very hard to be sure that an entire state is not affected of virus, we choose small cities instead.

# People of thane city can start working but no citizen can cross the thane city or enter the city from somewhere else even after the 21 day lock-down has been completed. Strict Border should be maintained. People will work from within city. Only government officials working towards removing corona virus should be allowed to enter and leave the city and that too by checking properly.

This way, we ensure that people of thane city do not get affected anymore and yet at the same time, work towards helping other cities as well. By doing this, we can ensure that people from this city can provide and produce groceries and other necessity goods required by other city to function while being on lock-down.

**Note that here, Thane city is taken as an example since based on the news there hasn‚Äôt been anyone affected yet**. This border type strategy should be implemented to every small cities in every state even after day 21 of country lock-down.

Over the period of time let‚Äôs say Mulund in Mumbai shows no sign of affected people. Then we can slowly **expand thane‚Äôs border and include mulund within border as well.** This way slowly and gradually we can take over multiple cities and over the period of time, an Entire state. And then multiple states can work towards removing corona from the entire country. Together.

I have very strong confidence in the above proposed strategy, if implemented properly can show positive effects on removing corona virus from the entire country.

# Here‚Äôs what will happen, if border‚Äôs are lifted after 21 days of lock ‚Äì down.

If Border‚Äôs are lifted after 21 days of lock-down, then even if one single person is affected from any city and if he travels to a city which is entirely unaffected (for example Thane). The virus will spread again and again and then frequent lock-down will have to be conducted everywhere and we will not see any sign of progress at all.

In Conclusion, I believe this is a very good strategy to remove corona virus properly until standard cure is available. I hope you please at least read the above mentioned strategy. Also it maybe possible that government of India may have even better strategies to remove corona but If not then I do feel this has the ability to show positive sign of removal.

Also I have strong confidence in Government of India and Maharashtra to take proper measures to fight this combat.

I hope this comes to help one way or another",1585229854.0,,Coronavirus,dark,20,12

**The Crisis.** 

Maybe many aren‚Äôt used to the whole virus thing attacking a human, staying inside them, feeding on them, growing within, evolving, mutating, making them sick and spreading to the ones nearby by whatever means, here we say, a mere touch, or even inspiring the air they breathe out. 

This is something people don‚Äôt get to witness happening, which is why they don‚Äôt want to take it into something serious that could even affect them in turn, many are being ignorant, rather negligent.

If it were a Tsunami, waves crashing on the shores, capsizing boats, drowning people, screams all-around, there they get to see something live, they need not try and visualize things, as it‚Äôs all there happening. The same way an earthquake, cracks on the ground, buildings crumbling, felling of the walls and trees and everything around, even there they get to see something really bad happening around. This is where people get serious about, this is where they don‚Äôt try to mock it or laugh around it. They just want to witness it all live, hear the screams, look at the dead bodies being carried away, these define disasters or devastating occurrences and not something invisible, no matter how deadly it is or the amount of desolation it could bring upon the human kind let alone the economic impacts. People need to be more sensible and informed so that they get to understand the immensity of such an episode.

In a country of such a magnitude like India, people are supposed to be the paddlers rather they unknowingly are being a deterrence, breaking paddles, making holes on the deck, trying to fill the same with their fellow paddlers. 

There can never be a perfect government, even the best ones couldn‚Äôt satisfy all sections of people. The thing to be understood here is that no government would want its subjects to suffer and die, that too during times of crises, it‚Äôs the duty of the government to take care of the people and to provide them with the basic amenities so as to come out of the situation in good health, giving its all. 

There will be shortcomings, inconveniences, mismanagements, economic issues, the government would only look to sort it all out, the supposedly paddlers need not like it, but could be a little supportive at least during these times and keep their criticisms for later, this not only helps building confidence among people but would create an oneness, which would help in reaping greater positive results.

A mere comparison of governments, leaders, he did this, he did that kind of things will just be of no help during instances of such enormity. Hatred is one of the key concerns prevailing around, the criticizing of a person or a government or their deeds just for the sake of doing it has increased, irrespective of the place, context and relevance. Looking up for instances to quote as examples isn‚Äôt really necessary despite there being many. These open criticisms, on open forums and portals mocking the steps taken, being harsh towards people trying to help would create anxiety, fear and disruption amongst the public. Togetherness is the need of the hour, try to give strength and belief, spread positivity, educate the ignorant and the young, be responsible, talk to those in need, befriend the lonely, support the whole cause. 

If you want to be supportive, be it, if not, just stay calm and wait for the situation to stabilize and let normalcy prevail. Lives are being lost, precious human lives, stay calm, stay home, stay safe, let the storm pass, we shall pick up the rags and broken wood later, Together...!",1585258171.0,,Coronavirus,dark,6,9
4017,"Drinking hot water, avoiding cold foods - prep for the virusThis is a question for the doctors of this subreddit or anyone who can answer it with any kind of authority. Personal anecdotes won't really help me much.

So every Indian parent has always been a strong advocate of drinking warm water or hot water and all kinds of other shit like milk with turmeric or gargling regularly even before the virus. But now they have more ammunition. Now you have to do these things if you want to beat the virus. I also want to include vitamin C tablets to the purview of this question as ""they boost immunity"". 

I'm not going to argue against whatever health benefits these things might have normally. I'm sure they're great. But my dad has a whatsapp recording of some guy who has a friend in China (idfk as if that claim makes the recording more authentic) where the guy goes through a list of things to help you prep against the virus. 

He makes a case for how warm water doesn't let mucus collect and takes it to your stomach where gastric acids deal w it. And says to avoid cold foods during these times. Alnd take vit C. And gargle regularly.

I guess my question how exactly do these things help against the virus, if at all?  And if they don't how do I convince my parents to calm down?

I also want to add the reason for my cynicism is I've heard doctors say that you can try supplements for improving immunity but nothing can really help you from getting the virus. And don't cold foods only worsen the symptoms of an existing cold virus instead of causing it? No one is implying eating ice cream will give you corona but their implication is that eating cold foods will make you weak against corona. I hope I can get a definite answer out of this that I can carry around for the rest of my life.",1585232063.0,,Coronavirus,dark,20,5

4030,"Why everyone needs to read John Rawls‚Äôs Theory of JusticeIf you could redesign society from scratch, what would it look like?

How would you distribute wealth and power?

Would you make everyone equal or not? How would you define fairness and equality?

And ‚Äî what if you had to make those decisions without knowing who you would be in this new society?

Philosopher John Rawls asked just that in a thought experiment known as ‚Äúthe Veil of Ignorance‚Äù in his 1971 book, Theory of Justice.

‚Äî‚Äî

Imagine you‚Äôre not yet born, but you‚Äôre somehow contemplating your prospects, how and where you might end up. If you were to look down at your country, as it is right now, would the thought of landing randomly in a life somewhere in there fill you with comfort or dread?

Is child poverty on the rise? Are homeless people bedding down on the streets while investment properties lie empty? Is there social mobility or are people just stuck? Do those from all walks of life have equal access to the best education? Are women paid less for the same work as men? Is wealth concentrated in the hands of the few? Is healthcare a lottery, depending on postcodes?

You might end up in anywhere down there. Would you cast a longing glance at a fairer society, say Norway, as you hurtled towards your fate? You might, but you might also now have a better idea about justice, and what ought to change in the real world that we‚Äôre in.

‚Äî‚Äî

This position, where you have no clue about how you‚Äôre going to end up in the world is the ‚ÄúOriginal Position‚Äù, you are behind the ‚ÄúVeil of Ignorance‚Äù, which was the central idea to test for fairness.

Behind the Veil of Ignorance, no one knows who they are. They lack clues as to their class, their privileges, their disadvantages, or even their personality. They exist as an impartial group, tasked with designing a new society with its own conception of justice.

As a thought experiment, the Veil of Ignorance is powerful because our usual opinions regarding what is just and unjust are informed by our own experiences. We are shaped by our race, gender, class, education, appearance, sexuality, career, family, and so on. On the other side of the Veil of Ignorance, none of that exists. Technically, the resulting society should be a fair one.

Because people behind the Veil of Ignorance do not know who they will be in this new society, any choice they make in structuring that society could either harm them or benefit them.

If they decide men will be superior, for example, they must face the risk that they will be women. If they decide that 10% of the population will be slaves to the others, they cannot be surprised if they find themselves to be slaves. No one wants to be part of a disadvantaged group, so the logical belief is that the Veil of Ignorance would produce a fair, egalitarian society.

‚Äî‚Äî

Justice is blind. The veil forces you to be objective and impartial. It forces you to put yourself in the shoes of others.

Overall speed is slow. I used to get around 45-50 mbps but now it is down to 10-15 mbps. But that's ok and understandable since everyone is at home there is a load on the network.

But I've noticed that some sites are really slow compared to the rest. Sites like Youtube are working fine without any buffer but Twitter/Reddit is really slow (including videos/images on it).

When I switch from BSNL broadband to my Phone (Airtel) internet it is fine so it is only on BSNL.

Even after vaccine is prepared it would take time to make for such a massive population, supply, setup team that would go home and give vaccination across the country.

If we think practically I don't think we can even get close to it in these 21 days because no one knows when vaccine would come. And those who are giving themselves false hope that comparatively India has very less cases, please understand the fact that not even 1% of the country has gone for an actual test.

4086,"Struck in gwalior.On 23 March, I booked a flight from gwalior to Patna on spice Jet. 
I was to take a flight to Kolkata (24 March - 16:55 to 19:20) 
and a connecting flight to patna from there (25 March- 06:00 to 07:00 )

After I had booked my tickets, the government published a notification that no domestic flights were to fly after 24 March midnight. 

So I had decided to go to Kolkata and stay with my friend. I was also feeling lucky to have booked the flight earlier because the ticket prices were soaring and reached upto INR 60,000 

I reached the airport hours earlier, at 10 AM itself as I was worried about taxis not running. Naturally, I had not eaten anything because I thought I'd be eating on the flight itself.

I successfully checked in and went through the security check. 

Then my name was called out, I went to the officials where they asked how many bags I had and started accusing me that I had cancelled my ticket between my check-in time and the boarding time. 

They accused me of booking through an agent and also accused me of sharing my PNR with others. I categorically refused all their claims. 

They official there started raising their voices and demanded that I left the airport. 

I fly frequently and this had never happened to me before. I tried reasoning with them and even asked for a fresh booking so that I could reach my loved ones. 

I am just a tourist in gwalior and have no family here. They refused to listen to me. This sent me down a spiral and my brain got numb from this traumatic incident. 

They made me sign in a register. Having not eaten and gone through several people shouting at me, I was under extreme duress and I do not remember what was written in there.

I was unceremoniously dumped outside the airport, where I sat down and cried bitterly for a long time.
 
The hotel I was staying in refused to re- accommodate me citing lockdown. 

All of my friends came together to help me find a place to stay. We collectively called around 20 hotels, all of them refused to let me even spend the night.

By now it was 7 at night and I was really weak and unable to function properly. 

A kind taxi driver took upon himself to find me a guest house. He even offered to let me stay at his place. I was moved to tears by his kindness after being treated horribly by the 'cultured high class' people at the airport. 

I finally found a guest house near maharajpura thana. 

Our PM announced a nation wide lockdown at 8. I am stuck in a strange place where I got trauma from people I had never expected. 

I am a small businessman and my parents depend on me. They are worried for my health and safety while I am hundreds of kilometre away in a guest house, estimated to spend around INR15000- 20000 for my stay in this guest house. 

I had received no mail from spice Jet for any refund or apology. 


I have no other way to reach out to any authorities. So I am writing this down. Please share this with whoever you consider as relevant and might be able to be of any help to me. 

Tl;dr: Spice Jet kicked me out of the airport after check in and I am stranded in gwalior with limited resources and no family.",1585221234.0,,Coronavirus,dark,14,32

4115,"India going Superpower in 2020India has long envisioned the idea of being a superpower by the year 2020. 
But back to reality, that was a very far fetched dream because of the conditions and situation the country had been going through.

Then came in Covid-19. It absolutely disrupted China's economy. Italy and parts of Europe are also devastated. The Middle East is hit with the virus and along with that the extreme slashing of rates of crude oil. The US has begun to realise the seriousness of the pandemic (except a few people, ofcourse) and is said to overtake Italy in ways. 
India on the other hand seems reasonably stable at the time. 

With the government's quick response, is there a slightest possibility that India overcomes this wave better than others and maybe emerge to be one of the leading nations?

Also, I am aware about the fact that India is yet to undergo the boom in the number of affected and it can be chaotic. But from an optimistic point of view there are a lot of things that can be working in our favour to make India one of the leading nations.",1585180574.0,#ab494b,AskIndia,light,16,0

2. There needs to be a centralized way to quarantine everyone: confirmed patients in hospitals, their family in hotels, health workers in separate hotels. Transport between them controlled by the government.
3. Free rooms for front-line health care workers to rest amid the battle and protect their families
4. Screening + Mitigation + Suppression all need to be perfect

**The state of Goa has also breached the centre's direct order by shutting down ALL food supplies and outlets in the state.**

Foreign nationals stuck in the state are already trying to get international media's attention to this crisis , but we need more voices!

The nail in the coffin for me was seeing [THIS](https://twitter.com/ArvindKejriwal/status/1243078456671236098) tweet by Delhi's CM. He's allowed 24X7 operation of all grocery stores in his jurisdiction which felt like a gut-punch as a Goan. We haven't had fresh supply in nearly five days!

Please do not trust any news outlet or journalists claiming that Goa has things under control. Goan government's policy is literally murdering its own people to tackle COVID-19.

If Corona doesn't get us, starvation surely will. If you can, at the very least, tweet, tag, or shame the Goan administration. It's a total nightmare!  


**EDITS:**

Someone just filed a petition against Goa's government:

# Tl;dr

IFF wrote to the Jammu and Kashmir Government and Ministry of Home Affairs seeking restoration of 4G internet services in Kashmir during the COVID 19 crisis. The region is already struggling to recover from the six month long shutdown imposed on 5 August 2019 and several of its key healthcare indicators are below the national average. Therefore, immediate restoration of 4G internet services in the region is necessary to prevent spread of the virus through telemedicine and effective public outreach.

# Free and Open Internet for All

&#x200B;

[\(Screenshot of ToI's tweet before it was deleted\)](https://preview.redd.it/qfb2xn7mkyo41.png?width=608&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed515e7a9ee26e760826e15eb81d154e0395548c)

&#x200B;

Yesterday, the Times of India tweeted that 4G internet services had been restored in Jammu and Kashmir but it subsequently deleted the tweet and published another [**article**](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/times-fact-check/news/fake-alert-order-claiming-4g-internet-to-be-restored-in-jammu-alone-is-fake/articleshow/74814962.cms) about this information being false. This led to considerable confusion and it once again brought into sharp focus the continued deprivation of rights suffered by the people of Jammu and Kashmir.

While the rest of India transitions to work from home and relies on the internet to seek latest COVID 19 information and stay in touch with loved ones, the internet is still being slowed down to 2G speed in Jammu and Kashmir. ¬†Jammu and Kashmir already has 7 confirmed COVID 19 cases. With these figures expected to rise exponentially in the next few weeks, the Government must make all tools including high speed internet available to doctors and patients to save lives. ¬†

# Dashboards and Chatbots for All

While responding to the COVID 19 crisis, the Indian Government has embraced technology to disseminate accurate and updated information to panic struck citizens. Take for instance, the Ministry of Health‚Äôs COVID 19 dashboard which provides latest state-wise figures and guidelines for different stakeholders. The Ministry of Health and MyGovIndia have also collaborated with WhatsApp to launch a chat box which will address queries of concerned citizens through text, infographics and video. Even private players like Apollo Hospitals have developed tech tools which allow people to assess their risk of developing COVID 19 through a mobile app. However, the residents of Jammu and Kashmir may be unable to access such life-saving information because the Government is slowing down their internet speed to 2G which makes it very difficult to download videos and heavy files.

# Telemedicine for All

The difficulty in communicating through video on a 2G internet connection also means that doctors in Jammu and Kashmir cannot use telemedicine. During pandemics, hospitals become hotbeds of infection and any effective containment strategy must limit the number of persons visiting hospitals. Reducing the number of visitors in hospitals is only possible if doctors are able to remotely assess and monitor the condition of patients who do not require intensive care. However, remote consultations which require video facilities to visually examine the patient are practically impossible with slow 2G internet services.

Healthcare is a fundamental right and accessing healthcare through the internet also enjoys constitutional protection. The essential nature of internet services during this period is also demonstrated by the Ministry of Home Affairs classification of telecom and internet services as necessities during the 21 day lockdown. Therefore, depriving the people of Jammu and Kashmir of meaningful internet connectivity during a pandemic is completely unconscionable and the Government must immediately restore 4G services to reduce suffering and loss of life.

4175,"Lockdown and why country wideFirst things first, deciding to shutdown a country is a courageous decision. Yes, Modi said if we don‚Äôt shut down right now, we will go back 21 years. Shutting down a (still) growing vibrant economy for 21 days still puts back not just the economy but the people by few months at least. This is however very justified.

Reasons are -
A) Unlike China - yes, the way the events are unfolding in India and several other countries are very unlike China are very different data wise. In China, they had a clear epicenter that they could simply afford to shut down for longer than the other areas. We on the other hand do not have an epicenter. Therefore, we can‚Äôt isolate.

B) Tests - To generate good data, you need to test statistically significant number of people. We unfortunately do not have enough tests done, nor enough results. In fact, the asymptotic nature of the disease itself makes it even more necessary to have more sophisticated calibrated tests. Think of US, they are using a highly sophisticated and efficient test from a company called Roche Molecular Systems. They can supply 400,000 tests right now. In the absence of tests and effective delivery of them at the ground level, India was left with no option but to shutdown. 

The difference between China and India though - the speed with which China conducted tests in lockdown. By the time, India gets enough tests done, I am sure we would have spent a lot more time in lockdown. We have to test more and fast.

C) PPE- look around. The PPE you see in India is at best make-shift. Chinese, due to excessive pollution, mass manufacturing, past pandemics, were already sitting on huge quantities of PPE. India on the other hand can‚Äôt even get the front line workers to be equipped with masks. The statistics for bed are 1 on every 36000 and ventilators 1 on every 84000

D) Doctors - In China, state controlled entities were quick to direct even the private practicing doctors to go serve for the public cause. Have already seen reports that our private doctors are still either hiding or milking for only the paying patients. 

Overall, shutdown may flatten the curve, however, this is going to be a long fight for us. We are not China. We are going to go back here. We need more than just lockdown. And, right now more than financial stimulus to the economy  we need to quickly build our  overall healthcare system to respond.",1585174179.0,,Coronavirus,dark,2,16

Can suggestions be on optimal way or conformation for vegetable or essential supplies, or optimal time gap for garbage collection (to decrease chances of being in near distance with others), etc.?

4196,"Thoughts on police violence during lock downThere have been several reports and videos and reddit posts about police being violent to impose the lock down, and there are a lot of people complaining about it, obviously. And that is natural, since most of those people seem to be the kind that have never experienced curfew-like situations in their lives. Here are some thoughts that try to put the situation in context.

This is the first time in India that curfew-like orders have been imposed nationwide in a non-violent environment. The lock down is not to prevent riots or looting and things like that, but rather, to prevent the transmission of a highly contagious disease for which there is no cure.

This order has always been enforced by the police, and the enforcement therefore depends on how the police on the ground interprets the order.

Since the threat is not that of violence, police won't be out in full force with guns. Instead, they would have non-lethal weapons, like lathis.

Citing police violence is quite easy to do, but we all know how the public behaves too. You see one person jumping a traffic signal, and usually, several others follow. That applies to pretty much any and all rules in our country, because somehow, it seems to me that Indians just hate following rules that are personally inconvenient to them. And the sheer number of people breaking the rules makes it impossible for the police to actually stop them all (whether to challan or to take bribe is a different story).

Since this is a drastic situation, maybe the police is using violence against some to deter others who might be considering this as an especially good time to go out. There are many such people, obviously, like those who went to Goa over the weekend and are now fucked, or those who have been finding pleasure in driving on the empty streets, or those who are just generally considering this a holiday and can't tolerate being indoors for too long.

Police are also humans, they have their own families to take care of too, and given the nature of their jobs, they are also at higher risk than the average person. That could make them more on the edge than they would usually be.

By all means, berate the police for violence against civilians. But also see where the police is coming from. Our support and cooperation with them would make this current crisis easier to deal with. And not all police personnel are like that, there are also videos of cops doing good deeds or being super polite, like that cop (in Tamil Nadu somewhere, I think) folding his hands and requesting people to stay in. And also, equating police violence with some sort of a secret dictatorial agenda by the prime minister or his obnoxious, fat sidekick is just so stupid that I won't even bother addressing that.

I found that the most important material for N95 and sugical masks is non woven **'polypropylene'.**

It is the same material as your PP spun filter, the white prefilter in your water purifiers.

N95 masks use 3 thin layers of PP (20-25 gm/sq.m) and a polyester material.

The basics are this:

1. first polypropylene layer
2. polyester or  terylene(yet to find this at home)
3. second polypropylene layer
4. third polypropylene layer.

The polypropylene (PP) layers vary in quality but i feel the PP spun filter can be used.

I plan to peel thin layers of the pre-filter material, probably less than 0.5mm, and use 3 of these along with polyester and cotton casing.

I believe with a decent fit it will be decent enough mask. Almost same or slightly better than surgical mask.(Please do not confuse these masks with respirators, but they will be close to what we are used to buying  from amazon et al.)

**Please do not fall for mis-info that masks are useless** (i was foolish enough). The CDC(USA) advises to use cotton handkerchief if nothing else is available. It seems to provide about 50% protection from airborne particles and aerosol droplets.

**US FDA says**\*\*\*:\*\*\* *"" If worn properly, a surgical mask is meant to help block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays, or splatter that may contain germs (viruses and bacteria), keeping it from reaching your mouth and nose. Surgical masks may also help reduce exposure of your saliva and respiratory secretions to others.""*

I know viruses are 0.01 micron i.e 10\^-8 or 10 nm in size, but N95 respirators use the same material.

Plus these masks will stop any droplets (even aersol drops), which is how corona spreads, as they will be few micron range. They will also prevent you from touching your face and nose.

Hope this helps. Do upvote so it helps others.

4370,"How do I chose career?As the world move from one technology to another and job environments become more and more competitive, the right early choice of career and skill attainment comes handy for young aspirants. 

From my experience pf 15 years in career counselling, training and skill development I submit a step by step guide on deciding career choice.

**Lets first define Career :**

‚ÄúCareer is the time span of a person‚Äôs life in which he/she works to earn livelihood and all his other needs‚Äù. Per my opinion the career starts the day when you decide what to do and take steps in attaining the required skills for the particular career choice.

Lets go step by step in deciding the career choice:

**Step 1 :**

Check your interests : These days interest is a highly rates factor which people see as career, the only problem with interest is that it keeps on changing.

1. List down all your interests. Write down each and every interest.
2. Check which interests are long term. Long term interests hold the key s short term ones cant go on to become life long commitment.
3. Check which out of them can be commercialized/ monetized. I know this may sound weird but we are deciding career here and primary motive of career earning money for livelihood.
4. The narrowed down list will go into the second step.

**Step 2 :**

Check your APTITUDE. It is your inherent capability to do something, it can be in form of some hobbies, some favorite subjects, topics or any performing art. You need to check your aptitude. Per my opinion, aptitude is the next level of interest. following can be done to check your aptitude:

1. The advice can be taken from Parents, teachers, professional counselors etc.
2. Psychometric tests can be used to check your aptitude. While most of the psychometric tests will be paid, there are few which are available free of cost online like [Career Assessment](https://www.lpu.in/admission/career_assessment.php) . You will get a full exhaustive report about your bent of mind, your strengths an weaknesses etc for you to make a analysed choice. What kind of courses you can do.
3. Since the skills need to be attained for going next step, your choice of courses or training will be decided here.

**Step 3 :**

Check the market scenario :

1. You need to check which courses or training that you have shortlisted have a long term market standing. Since the last 30 years, most of the jobs which are available today get obsolete in 15 years of time, a market scenario analysis is required.
2. You need to chose the technologies or market space which is either in its upward curve or nascent stage. You need to be very careful in this step. Do not choose the industry or technology which is going obsolete or getting replaced at fast pace.

**Step 4 :**

Family background :

You need to keep your family background in mind too, Why ?

Doctor‚Äôs son becomes a doctor, Teacher‚Äôs son becomes a teacher, Actor‚Äôs daughter became actress, /lawyer‚Äôs daughter becomes lawyer, politician‚Äôs progeny become politicians‚Ä¶ and many many other examples !

Although controversial as it may also be called nepotism, your family background plays a major part in shaping up your career. When you hear about a particular work since your childhood, the brain is conditioned automatically for it.

Not compulsory though for everyone.

**Step 5 :**

Choosing a trainer: Now that you know what do do, next step is where to do. The point being, Which university or college to chose. In brief the following factors must be taken into account before you choose a university:

1. Does it have a course of your choice? And is the course curriculum developed dynamically to cater to industry needs.
2. Does the university have required infrastructure like labs, libraries, equipment, software to support the training.
3. Does the university have the qualified and high quality research based culture and competent faculty.
4. Does the university have diversity of students? It is necessary for developing right sensibilities, cross cultural team work and interpersonal skills.
5. Does the university train you not only in required skills but also in professional enhancement?
6. Does the university give language training?
7. Does the university have industry connect?
8. Does the university have the PLACEMENTS?
9. Co-Curricular activities an events for developing overall personality and networking skills?
10. Does the university provide exposure to students via regular industry interactions, visits, internships etc.
11. Does the university have international collaborations for enhanced international exposure to students?
12. Does the university have strong alumni network? This is one of the most important ones, if the Alumni of university is happy and connected to their Alma mater, it means it has done a great job

**Research about all these questions about your shortlisted universities and you will get your answer.**

Wishing a successful and fulfilling career to everyone.

Coming back has reminded me why I was so keen to leave home in the first place: my dad had stockpiled on ‚Äúessentials‚Äù, including two large bottles of booze, and now begins his drinking in the late morning. Moreover, my mum is locked down in another city altogether, so she isn‚Äôt here to give me any moral support.

My dad‚Äôs not bad, but he is negligent, especially when drunk, with meals in particular. My health is not great and I can‚Äôt eat random things at random times. 

I really need a place to stay where I can either cook for myself or get food, and where I can sit and study in peace for all my classes. Please let me know. I‚Äôm in Delhi-NCR.
